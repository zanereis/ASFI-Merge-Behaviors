What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf a bean has generic types with bounds ( eg T <: SomeClass>) , as getters/setters, then depending upon the nature of the bounds, if it is java Serializable, KryoSerializable or a UDT Type, then appropriate encoder is created. If the bound is of first two types, then the data is represented as a BinaryType, while if the bound is of UDT type then schema / behaviour follows UDT Type.\r\n\r\nFollowing things are considered while fixing the issue:\r\n\r\nSince the concrete class type of the generic parameter is not available, it is not possible to create instance of the class ( during deser), if the bound represents any other type than the 3 mentioned above.\r\nBecause a UDT class can appear anywhwere in the bound's hierarchy, all the super classes of the bound ( including the bound) is considered and checked . To create the encoder the preference is UDTType followed by JavaSerializer or KryoSerializer, whichever shows first.\r\nThe majority of the code change in JavaTypeInference is a boolean check , to ignore any data type match when considering bound, except UDT and Type Variable ( type variable is included because T <: S and say S <: Serializable).\r\nFollowing cases are considered which are sort of boundary cases:\r\n\r\nIf the generic bean is of type\r\n`\r\nBean[T <: UDTClass] {\r\n@BeanProperty var udt: T = _\r\n}\r\nThen the UDTEncoder will be created for the field\r\n\r\nBut if the Bean is of type\r\n\r\nBean[T <: UDTDerivedClass] {\r\n@BeanProperty var udt: T = _\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nwhere UDTDerivedClass <: UDTClass\r\nThen a JavaSerializable encoder will be created , even though the class hierarchy of UDTDerivedClass contains UDTClass. The reason being that concrete instance created by UDTType would be of UDTClass which is not assignable to\r\nUDTDerivedClass\r\n`\r\n\r\nsimilarly for non generic bean class having UDTDerivedClass as bean property will also use Java Serialization encoder. ( added test for the same). The reason for JavaSerializationEncoder is same as that for Generic one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the regression in spark 3.3 onwards, where the bean having a generic type

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds UDT support to `Cast` expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOur customer faced an error when migrating queries that write UDT column from Hive to Iceberg table.\r\n\r\nThe error happens when Spark tries to cast UDT column to the data type (i.e., the sql type of the UDT) of the table column. The cast is added by table column resolution rule for V2 writing commands.\r\n\r\nCurrently `Cast` expression doesn't support casting between UDT and other types. However, underlying an UDT, it is serialized as its `sqlType`, `Cast` should be able to cast between the `sqlType` and other types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. User query can cast between UDT and other types.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to lower `KubernetesClusterSchedulerBackend.onDisconnected` log level to debug.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis INFO-level message was added here. We already propagate the disconnection reason to UI, and `No executor found` has been used when an unknown peer is connect or disconnect. \r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37821\r\n\r\nThe driver can be accessed by non-executors by design. And, all other resource managers do not complain at INFO level.\r\n```\r\nINFO KubernetesClusterSchedulerBackend$KubernetesDriverEndpoint: No executor found for x.x.x.0:x\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review because this is a log level change.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-25T16:41:50Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T05:37:26Z","closed_at":"2024-09-26T05:34:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6f7f1e55f5a8653489ffb786761c3a62a57012e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b3f550c4c6df45bfbb3d8f546492857e1203155b","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-49786","ref":"SPARK-49786","sha":"b3f550c4c6df45bfbb3d8f546492857e1203155b","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn order to clean up the usage of deprecated Guava API, the following changes were made in this pr:\r\n\r\n1. Replaced `Files.write(from, to, charset)` with `Files.asCharSink(to, charset).write(from)`. This change was made with reference to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/guava/blob/0c33dd12b193402cdf6962d43d69743521aa2f76/guava/src/com/google/common/io/Files.java#L275-L291\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n   * Writes a character sequence (such as a string) to a file using the given character set.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param from the character sequence to write\r\n   * @param to the destination file\r\n   * @param charset the charset used to encode the output stream; see {@link StandardCharsets} for\r\n   *     helpful predefined constants\r\n   * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs\r\n   * @deprecated Prefer {@code asCharSink(to, charset).write(from)}.\r\n   */\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  @InlineMe(\r\n      replacement = \"Files.asCharSink(to, charset).write(from)\",\r\n      imports = \"com.google.common.io.Files\")\r\n  public static void write(CharSequence from, File to, Charset charset) throws IOException {\r\n    asCharSink(to, charset).write(from);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Replaced `Files.append(from, to, charset)` with `Files.asCharSink(to, charset, FileWriteMode.APPEND).write(from)`. This change was made with reference to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/guava/blob/0c33dd12b193402cdf6962d43d69743521aa2f76/guava/src/com/google/common/io/Files.java#L350-L368\r\n\r\n```java\r\n/**\r\n   * Appends a character sequence (such as a string) to a file using the given character set.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param from the character sequence to append\r\n   * @param to the destination file\r\n   * @param charset the charset used to encode the output stream; see {@link StandardCharsets} for\r\n   *     helpful predefined constants\r\n   * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs\r\n   * @deprecated Prefer {@code asCharSink(to, charset, FileWriteMode.APPEND).write(from)}.

Replaced `Files.toString(file, charset)` with `Files.asCharSource(file, charset).read()`. This change was made with reference to:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/guava/blob/0c33dd12b193402cdf6962d43d69743521aa2f76/guava/src/com/google/common/io/Files.java#L243-L259\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  /**\r\n   * Reads all characters from a file into a {@link String}, using the given character set.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param file the file to read from\r\n   * @param charset the charset used to decode the input stream; see {@link StandardCharsets} for\r\n   *     helpful predefined constants\r\n   * @return a string containing all the characters from the file\r\n   * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs\r\n   * @deprecated Prefer {@code asCharSource(file, charset).read()}.\r\n   */\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  @InlineMe(\r\n      replacement = \"Files.asCharSource(file, charset).read()\",\r\n      imports = \"com.google.common.io.Files\")\r\n  public static String toString(File file, Charset charset) throws IOException {\r\n    return asCharSource(file, charset).read();\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Replaced `HashFunction.murmur3_32()` with `HashFunction.murmur3_32_fixed()`. This change was made with reference to:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/guava/blob/0c33dd12b193402cdf6962d43d69743521aa2f76/guava/src/com/google/common/hash/Hashing.java#L99-L115\r\n\r\n```java\r\n /**\r\n   * Returns a hash function implementing the <a\r\n   * href=\"https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/blob/master/src/MurmurHash3.cpp\">32-bit murmur3\r\n   * algorithm, x86 variant</a> (little-endian variant), using the given seed value, <b>with a known\r\n   * bug</b> as described in the deprecation text.\r\n   *\r\n   * <p>The C++ equivalent is the MurmurHash3_x86_32 function (Murmur3A), which however does not\r\n   * have the bug.\r\n   *\r\n   * @deprecated This implementation produces incorrect hash values from the {@link\r\n   *     HashFunction#hashString} method if the string contains non-BMP characters.

The difference between `MURMUR3_32` and `MURMUR3_32_FIXED` lies in the different `supplementaryPlaneFix` parameters passed when constructing the `Murmur3_32HashFunction`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/guava/blob/0c33dd12b193402cdf6962d43d69743521aa2f76/guava/src/com/google/common/hash/Murmur3_32HashFunction.java#L56-L59\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  static final HashFunction MURMUR3_32 =\r\n      new Murmur3_32HashFunction(0, /* supplementaryPlaneFix= */ false);\r\n  static final HashFunction MURMUR3_32_FIXED =\r\n      new Murmur3_32HashFunction(0, /* supplementaryPlaneFix= */ true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the `supplementaryPlaneFix` parameter is only used in `Murmur3_32HashFunction#hashString`, and Spark only utilizes `Murmur3_32HashFunction#hashInt`. Therefore, there will be no logical changes to this method after this change.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/guava/blob/0c33dd12b193402cdf6962d43d69743521aa2f76/guava/src/com/google/common/hash/Murmur3_32HashFunction.java#L108-L114\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  @Override\r\n  public HashCode hashInt(int input) {\r\n    int k1 = mixK1(input);\r\n    int h1 = mixH1(seed, k1);\r\n\r\n    return fmix(h1, Ints.BYTES);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Replaced `Throwables.propagateIfPossible(throwable, declaredType)` with `Throwables.throwIfInstanceOf(throwable, declaredType)` + `Throwables.throwIfUnchecked(throwable)`. This change was made with reference to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/guava/blob/0c33dd12b193402cdf6962d43d69743521aa2f76/guava/src/com/google/common/base/Throwables.java#L156-L175\r\n\r\n```\r\n/**\r\n   * Propagates {@code throwable} exactly as-is, if and only if it is an instance of {@link\r\n   * RuntimeException}, {@link Error}, or {@code declaredType}.\r\n   *\r\n   * <p><b>Discouraged</b> in favor of calling {@link #throwIfInstanceOf} and {@link\r\n   * #throwIfUnchecked}.\r\n   *\r\n   * @param throwable the Throwable to possibly propagate\r\n   * @param declaredType the single checked exception type declared by the calling method\r\n   * @deprecated Use a combination of {@link #throwIfInstanceOf} and {@link #throwIfUnchecked},\r\n   *     which togther provide the same behavior except that they reject {@code null}.\r\n   */\r\n  @Deprecated\r\n  @J2ktIncompatible\r\n  @GwtIncompatible // propagateIfInstanceOf\r\n  public static <X extends Throwable> void propagateIfPossible(\r\n      @CheckForNull Throwable throwable, Class<X> declaredType) throws X {\r\n    propagateIfInstanceOf(throwable, declaredType);\r\n    propagateIfPossible(throwable);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n6. Made modifications to `Throwables.propagate` with reference to https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/Why-we-deprecated-Throwables.propagate\r\n\r\n- For cases where it is known to be a checked exception, including `IOException`, `GeneralSecurityException`, `SaslException`, and `RocksDBException`, none of which are subclasses of `RuntimeException` or `Error`, directly replaced `Throwables.propagate(e)` with `throw new RuntimeException(e);`.\r\n\r\n- For cases where it cannot be determined whether it is a checked exception or an unchecked exception or Error, use\r\n\r\n```java\r\nthrowIfUnchecked(e);\r\nthrow new RuntimeException(e);\r\n```\r\n\r\n to replace `Throwables.propagate(e)`。\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/google/guava/blob/0c33dd12b193402cdf6962d43d69743521aa2f76/guava/src/com/google/common/base/Throwables.java#L199-L235\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  /**\r\n   * ...\r\n   * @deprecated To preserve behavior, use {@code throw e} or {@code throw new RuntimeException(e)}\r\n   *     directly, or use a combination of {@link #throwIfUnchecked} and {@code throw new\r\n   *     RuntimeException(e)}.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSmall followup to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/48037.\r\n`collector.reset()` is no longer needed in `CollectMetricsExec.doExecute()` because it is reset in `resetMetrics()`. This doesn't really matter in practice, but removing to clean up.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTiny cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't matter in practice.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen the drop list of `DataFrameDropColumns` contains an UnresolvedAttribute. Current rule mistakenly resolve the column with its grand-children's output attributes.\r\nIn dataframe/dataset API application, issue cannot be encountered since the `dropList` are all AttributeReferences.\r\nBut when we use Spark LogicalPlan, the bug will be encountered, the UnresolvedAttribute in dropList cannot work.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn `ResolveDataFrameDropColumns`\r\n```scala\r\n      val dropped = d.dropList.map {\r\n        case u: UnresolvedAttribute =>\r\n          resolveExpressionByPlanChildren(u, d.child)   //mistakenly resolve the column with its grand-children's output attributes\r\n        case e => e\r\n      }\r\n```\r\nTo fix it, change to `resolveExpressionByPlanChildren(u, d)` or `resolveExpressionByPlanOutput(u, d.child)`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix the resource leak of yarn allocator\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the target < running containers number, the assigned containers from the resource manager will be skipped, but these containers are not released by invoking the amClient.releaseAssignedContainer , that will make these containers reserved into the Yarn resourceManager at least 10 minutes. And so, the cluster resource will be wasted at a high ratio.\r\n\r\nAnd this will reflect that the vcore * seconds statistics from yarn side will be greater than the result from the spark event logs.\r\n\r\nFrom my statistics, the cluster resource waste ratio is ~25% if the spark jobs are exclusive in this cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport area plots with plotly backend on both Spark Connect and Spark classic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile Pandas on Spark supports plotting, PySpark currently lacks this feature. The proposed API will enable users to generate visualizations. This will provide users with an intuitive, interactive way to explore and understand large datasets directly from PySpark DataFrames, streamlining the data analysis workflow in distributed environments.\r\n\r\nSee more at [PySpark Plotting API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjOEzC8zcetG86WDvqkereQPj_NGLNW7Bdu910g30Dg/edit?usp=sharing) in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49530.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a shared SparkSessionBuilder interface.\r\n\r\nIt also adds a SparkSessionCompanion interface which is mean should be implemented by all SparkSession companions (a.k.a. `object SparkSession`. This is currently the entry point for session building, in the future we will also add the management of active/default sessions.\r\n\r\nFinally we add a companion for api.SparkSession. This will bind the implementation that is currently located in `org.apache.spark.sql`. This makes it possible to exclusively work with the interface, instead of selecting an implementation upfront.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe are creating a shared Scala SQL interface. Building a session is part of this interface.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests. I have added tests for the implementation binding.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-24T16:38:43Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T01:22:53Z","closed_at":"2024-09-25T01:22:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9ac4897d963f889a96de775b5dba9e7aca81c9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48229/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48229/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48229/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9797e7ef2ee5d83456149ea74448a56c4a50764b","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-49282","ref":"SPARK-49282","sha":"9797e7ef2ee5d83456149ea74448a56c4a50764b","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr adds possibility to use `IDENTIFIER(...)` for a catalog name in `SET CATALOG` statement.\r\nFor instance `SET CATALOG IDENTIFIER('test')` now works the same as `SET CATALOG test`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. Consistency of API. It can be confusing for user that he can use IDENTIFIER in some contexts but cannot for catalogs.\r\n2. Parametrization. It allows user to write `SET CATALOG IDENTIFIER(:user_data)` and doesn't worry about SQL injections.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now `SET CATALOG IDENTIFIER(...)` works. It can be used with any string expressions and parametrization.\r\nBut multipart identifiers (like `IDENTIFIER('database.table')`) are banned and will rise ParseException with `INVALID_SQL_SYNTAX.MULTI_PART_NAME`. This restriction always has been on grammar level, but now user can try to bind such identifier via parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests with several new covering new behavior.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nYes, some code suggestions\r\nGenerated-by: GitHub

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- optimize `ArrayBinarySearch` for `foldable` array.\r\n- fix a bug in the original implementation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes improve performance of the `array_binary_search()` function.\r\n- create an instance of `foldable{DataType}ArrayData` only once at the initialization ( avoid frequent calls to `ArrayData.to{DataType}Array()` ), and reuse it inside of `replacement` in the case when the `array` parameter is foldable.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nRunning benchmark: array binary

changes were proposed in this pull request?**\r\n\r\n[CSV Reader] Add Flag to Control Inference of Time-Only Columns as String or Timestamp During Schema Detection\r\n\r\n**Why are the changes needed?**\r\n\r\nBy default, Spark converts time-only columns to Timestamp type, which can lead to unintended behavior in certain use cases. This new flag will allow users to specify whether time-only columns should be inferred as Timestamp or as String.\r\nThis flag `inferStringTypeForTimeOnlyColumn` can be supplied while reading the CSV files , true will infer as String, default behaviour is false and infers as timestamp.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/615f60f5-4884-499f-97d5-438e409df43d)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Default/\"inferStringTypeForTimeOnlyColumn\" ->

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport scatter plots with plotly backend on both Spark Connect and Spark classic.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhile Pandas on Spark supports plotting, PySpark currently lacks this feature. The proposed API will enable users to generate visualizations. This will provide users with an intuitive, interactive way to explore and understand large datasets directly from PySpark DataFrames, streamlining the data analysis workflow in distributed environments.\r\n\r\nSee more at [PySpark Plotting API Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IjOEzC8zcetG86WDvqkereQPj_NGLNW7Bdu910g30Dg/edit?usp=sharing) in progress.\r\n\r\nPart of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-49530.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Scatter plots are supported as shown below.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> data = [(5.1, 3.5, 0), (4.9, 3.0, 0), (7.0, 3.2, 1), (6.4, 3.2, 1), (5.9, 3.0, 2)]\r\n>>> columns = [\"length\", \"width\", \"species\"]\r\n>>> sdf = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)\r\n>>> fig = sdf.plot(kind=\"scatter\", x=\"length\", y=\"width\")  # or fig = sdf.plot.scatter(x=\"length\", y=\"width\")\r\n>>> fig.show() \r\n```\r\n![newplot (6)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/deef452b-74d1-4f6d-b1ae-60722f3c2b17)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch corrects handling of a user-supplied `SPARK_USER` environment variable in the YARN app master. Currently, the user-supplied value gets appended to the default, like a classpath entry. The patch fixes it by using only the user-supplied value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOverriding the `SPARK_USER` environment variable in the YARN app master with configuration property `spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.SPARK_USER` currently results in an incorrect value. `Client#setupLaunchEnv` first sets a default in the environment map using the Hadoop user. After that, `YarnSparkHadoopUtil.addPathToEnvironment` sees the existing value in the map and interprets the user-supplied value as needing to be appended like a classpath entry. The end result is the Hadoop user appended with the classpath delimiter and user-supplied value, e.g. `cnauroth:overrideuser`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the app master now uses the user-supplied `SPARK_USER` if specified. (The default is still the Hadoop user.)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Existing unit tests pass.\r\n* Added new unit tests covering default and overridden `SPARK_USER` for the app master. The override test fails without this patch, and then passes after the patch is applied.\r\n* Manually tested in a live YARN cluster as shown below.\r\n\r\nManual testing used the `DFSReadWriteTest` job with overrides of `SPARK_USER`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n    --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n    --files all-lines.txt \\\r\n    --class org.apache.spark.examples.DFSReadWriteTest \\\r\n    --conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.SPARK_USER=sparkuser_appMaster \\\r\n    --conf spark.driverEnv.SPARK_USER=sparkuser_driver \\\r\n    --conf spark.executorEnv.SPARK_USER=sparkuser_executor \\\r\n    /usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar \\\r\n    all-lines.txt /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the patch, we can see the app master's `SPARK_USER` mishandled by looking at the `_SUCCESS` file in HDFS:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -ls -R /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest\r\n\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   - cnauroth:sparkuser_appMaster hadoop          0 2024-09-20 23:35

2288718 2024-09-20 23:35 /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest/dfs_read_write_test/part-00001\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the patch, we can see it working correctly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -ls -R /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   - sparkuser_appMaster hadoop          0 2024-09-23 17:13 /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest/dfs_read_write_test\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 sparkuser_appMaster hadoop          0

this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-23T22:42:06Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T04:37:38Z","closed_at":"2024-09-24T04:37:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2559112d5c3ec98e295718323726bee7426670bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48216/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48216/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48216/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/20719653a6ea349ee22b0e19faec7012ed666969","head":{"label":"cnauroth:SPARK-49760-branch-3.5","ref":"SPARK-49760-branch-3.5","sha":"20719653a6ea349ee22b0e19faec7012ed666969","user":{"login":"cnauroth","id":227407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzQwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/227407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth","html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":617152902,"node_id":"R_kgDOJMkBhg","name":"spark","full_name":"cnauroth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cnauroth","id":227407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzQwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/227407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth","html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSupport for interval types was added to the variant spec. This PR removes this support and removes the ability to cast from interval types to variant and vice versa.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI implemented interval support for Variant before, but because the Variant spec type is supposed to be open and compatible with other engines which may not support all the ANSI Interval types, more thought needs to be put into the design of these intervals in Variant.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, after this change, users would no longer be able to cast between variants and intervals.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests making sure that\r\n1. It is not possible to construct variants containing intervals.\r\n2. It is not possible to cast variants to intervals.\r\n3. Interval IDs in variants are treated just like other unknown type IDs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch corrects handling of a user-supplied `SPARK_USER` environment variable in the YARN app master. Currently, the user-supplied value gets appended to the default, like a classpath entry. The patch fixes it by using only the user-supplied value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOverriding the `SPARK_USER` environment variable in the YARN app master with configuration property `spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.SPARK_USER` currently results in an incorrect value. `Client#setupLaunchEnv` first sets a default in the environment map using the Hadoop user. After that, `YarnSparkHadoopUtil.addPathToEnvironment` sees the existing value in the map and interprets the user-supplied value as needing to be appended like a classpath entry. The end result is the Hadoop user appended with the classpath delimiter and user-supplied value, e.g. `cnauroth:overrideuser`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the app master now uses the user-supplied `SPARK_USER` if specified. (The default is still the Hadoop user.)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* Existing unit tests pass.\r\n* Added new unit tests covering default and overridden `SPARK_USER` for the app master. The override test fails without this patch, and then passes after the patch is applied.\r\n* Manually tested in a live YARN cluster as shown below.\r\n\r\nManual testing used the `DFSReadWriteTest` job with overrides of `SPARK_USER`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-submit \\\r\n    --deploy-mode cluster \\\r\n    --files all-lines.txt \\\r\n    --class org.apache.spark.examples.DFSReadWriteTest \\\r\n    --conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.SPARK_USER=sparkuser_appMaster \\\r\n    --conf spark.driverEnv.SPARK_USER=sparkuser_driver \\\r\n    --conf spark.executorEnv.SPARK_USER=sparkuser_executor \\\r\n    /usr/lib/spark/examples/jars/spark-examples.jar \\\r\n    all-lines.txt /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the patch, we can see the app master's `SPARK_USER` mishandled by looking at the `_SUCCESS` file in HDFS:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -ls -R /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest\r\n\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   - cnauroth:sparkuser_appMaster hadoop          0 2024-09-20 23:35

2288718 2024-09-20 23:35 /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest/dfs_read_write_test/part-00001\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the patch, we can see it working correctly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -ls -R /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   - sparkuser_appMaster hadoop          0 2024-09-23 17:13 /tmp/DFSReadWriteTest/dfs_read_write_test\r\n-rw-r--r--   1 sparkuser_appMaster hadoop          0

this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-23T21:02:55Z","updated_at":"2024-09-24T17:51:45Z","closed_at":"2024-09-24T04:35:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8741f45d185403d81cb3e9c4297e7d0dbc83a7f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e445b25a60965bde695c7eaf5408e8f90ca151e","head":{"label":"cnauroth:SPARK-49760","ref":"SPARK-49760","sha":"9e445b25a60965bde695c7eaf5408e8f90ca151e","user":{"login":"cnauroth","id":227407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzQwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/227407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth","html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":617152902,"node_id":"R_kgDOJMkBhg","name":"spark","full_name":"cnauroth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cnauroth","id":227407,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNzQwNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/227407?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth","html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cnauroth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cnauroth/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when evaluation of `lazy val` of some of the plans fails in QueryExecution, this `lazy val` remains not initialized, and another attempt will be made to initialize it the next time it's referenced. This leads to planning being performed multiple times, resulting in inefficiencies, and potential duplication of side effects, for example from ConvertToLocalRelation that can pull in UDFs with side effects.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour leads to inefficiencies and subtle problems in accidental situations, for example when plans are accessed for logging purposes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nThis change would bring slight behaviour changes:\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```\r\nval df = a.join(b)\r\nspark.conf.set(“spark.sql.crossJoin.enabled”, “false”)\r\ntry { df.collect() } catch { case _ => }\r\nspark.conf.set(“spark.sql.crossJoin.enabled”, “true”)\r\ndf.collect()\r\n```\r\nThis used to succeed, because the first time around the plan will not be initialized because it threw an error because of the cartprod, and the second time around it will try to initialize it again and pick up the new config. This will now fail, because the second execution will retrieve the error from the first time around instead of retrying.\r\n\r\nThe old semantics is if plan evaluation fails, try again next time it's accessed and if plan evaluation ever succeeded, keep that plan. The new semantics is that if plan evaluation fails, it keeps that error and rethrows it next time the plan is accessed. A new QueryExecution object / new Dataset is needed to reset it.\r\n\r\nSpark 4.0 may be a good candidate for a slight change in this, to make sure that we don't re-execute the optimizer, and potential side effects of it.\r\n\r\nNote: These behaviour changes have already happened in Spark Connect mode, where the Dataset object is not reused across execution. This change makes Spark Classic and Spark Connect behave the same again.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests shows no issues, except for the tests that exhibit the behaviour change described above.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nTrivial code completion suggestions.\r\nGenerated-by: Github

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nGet rid of the complicated \"promise\"-based completion callback mechanism, and introduce a lock-free state machine. The gist is,\r\n- A thread can only be interrupted when it is in a certain state: started.\r\n- A successful interruption means the interrupted thread must call the completion callback.\r\n- Interruption after completion or before starting is prohibited without relying on a mutex.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExecution can be interrupted before started, thus causing the \"closed\" message to be omitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSparkConnectServiceSuite.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changes the message of ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW error and adds relevant try expressions:\r\n- try_make_interval\r\n- try_conv\r\n- try_round\r\n- try_bround\r\n\r\nAlso this PR fixes hints for:\r\n- sum\r\n- average\r\n\r\nSome expressions never hit errors, but are present in the inheritance of the base classes, so are addressed as well:\r\n- ceil\r\n- floor\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes _LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2042 as it is as it is a suberror of ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW.\r\n\r\nAs this PR got pretty big, improvement for `MathUtils` functions will be done in a separate PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW contains suggested fix for turning off ANSI mode. Now that in Spark 4.0.0 we have moved to ANSI mode on by default, we want to keep suggestions of this kind to the minimum. There exist implementations of `try_*` functions which provide safe way to get behaviour as for ANSI mode off and suggestions of this kind should be sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn this case, try expressions were missing so new expressions were added to patch up the missing implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, error message will change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests cover message change, but try expressions are tested separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nEnabling `spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage` may cause significant performance regression in some cases. On the executor side, you can see that 47.99% of the CPU is in `[deoptimization]`. This scenario can be avoided by increasing `PerMethodRecompilationCutoff`. This PR adds this workaround to the doc.\r\n\r\n![profile-executor-before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f035c3b-1525-4a74-9aab-93a58e3bdf89)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47943 that enables ANSI for malformed input test in ProcedureSuite.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe specific test fails with ANSI mode disabled\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/10951615244/job/30408963913\r\n\r\n```\r\n- malformed input to implicit cast *** FAILED *** (4 milliseconds)\r\n  Expected exception org.apache.spark.SparkNumberFormatException to be thrown, but no exception was thrown (ProcedureSuite.scala:264)\r\n  org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException:\r\n  at org.scalatest.Assertions.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:472)\r\n  at

depends on `sum`'s failure so this PR simply enables ANSI mode for that specific test.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran with ANSI mode off.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- When pruning the schema of the struct in `GetArrayStructFields`, rely on the existing `StructType` to obtain the pruned schema instead of using the accessed field.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n- Fixes a bug in `OptimizeCsvJsonExprs` rule that would have otherwise changed the schema fields of the underlying struct to be extracted.\r\n- This would show up as a correctness issue where for a field instead of picking the right values we would have ended up giving null output.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The query output would change for the queries of the following type:\r\n```\r\nSELECT\r\n  from_json('[{\"a\": '||id||', \"b\": '|| (2*id) ||'}]', 'array<struct<a: INT, b: INT>>').a,\r\n  from_json('[{\"a\": '||id||', \"b\": '|| (2*id) ||'}]', 'array<struct<a: INT, b: INT>>').A\r\nFROM\r\n  range(3) as t\r\n```\r\n\r\nEarlier, the result would had been:\r\n```\r\nArray([ArraySeq(0),ArraySeq(null)], [ArraySeq(1),ArraySeq(null)], [ArraySeq(2),ArraySeq(null)])\r\n```\r\nvs the new result is (verified through spark-shell):\r\n```\r\nArray([ArraySeq(0),ArraySeq(0)], [ArraySeq(1),ArraySeq(1)], [ArraySeq(2),ArraySeq(2)])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added unit tests.\r\n- Without this change, the added test would fail as we would have modified the schema from `a` to `A`:\r\n```\r\n- SPARK-49743: prune unnecessary columns from GetArrayStructFields does not change schema *** FAILED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`spark.shuffle.accurateBlockSkewedFactor` was added in Spark 3.3.0 in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36967 and is a useful shuffle configuration to prevent issues where `HighlyCompressedMapStatus` wrongly estimates the shuffle block sizes when the block size distribution is skewed, which can cause the shuffle reducer to fetch too much data and OOM. This PR adds this config to the Spark config docs page to make it discoverable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make this useful config discoverable by users and make them able to resolve shuffle fetch OOM issues themselves.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this is a documentation fix. Before this PR there's no `spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.skewedPartitionFactor` in the `Shuffle Behavior` section on [the Configurations page](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html) and now there is.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nOn the IDE:\r\n<img width=\"1633\" alt=\"image\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNullPointerException was thrown when invalid options were provided in the run function of SaveIntoDataSourceCommand up to now. That is because this map is propagated [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-3.5/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/jdbc/JDBCOptions.scala#L54), and java.util.Properties throws NPE if key/value is null. In map, a key cannot be null, but a value can, so that is why this NPE is possible to produce.\r\nI propose we send the client an appropriate error condition. I've created a new error condition `INVALID_OPTIONS.NULL_VALUE`. Options are checked, and the error is thrown if there exists an entry in options map where the value is null.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo send the client an appropriate error.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, in case invalid options are sent, we throw `INVALID_OPTIONS.NULL_VALUE` instead of NullPointerException.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nWrote a unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR I propose that we add classification of JDBC driver exception that represent syntax errors on external databases.\r\nQueries generated from Spark that are sent to connectors should never have syntax error, and always indicate to a bug in code.\r\n\r\nHaving this classification would greatly help in identifying bugs faster and improving quality.\r\n\r\nDocumentation about error codes for syntax errors:\r\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/errors-events/database-engine-events-and-errors-0-to-999?view=sql-server-ver16\r\nhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html\r\nhttps://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-error-code-reference/\r\nhttps://www.h2database.com/javadoc/org/h2/api/ErrorCode.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1) This gives customer more precise error message about issue being hit.\r\n2) Help identify bugs faster as syntax error thrown from jdbc connectors should never happen.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, previously customers would get `FAILED_JDBC. UNCLASSIFIED` or internal error when syntax error occurs in JDBC, whereas they will now get `FAILED_JDBC.SYNTAX_ERROR`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nIntegration tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- forcefully check `usage`\r\n- correct the non-standard writing of 4 expressions (`shiftleft`, `shiftright`, `shiftrightunsigned`, `between`)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1.When some expressions have non-standard `usage` writing, corresponding explanations may be omitted in our documentation, such as `shiftleft`\r\n\r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/preview/sql-ref-functions-builtin.html\r\n- Before (Note: It looks very weird to only appear in `examples` and not in the `Conditional Functions` catalog)\r\n<img width=\"906\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7713cda-a8ea-4367-82d6-252efbac1c47\">\r\n\r\n- After\r\n<img width=\"904\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebbb1bc7-74a8-4acf-9d18-ec80b881aeb7\">\r\n\r\n2.When there is an `non-standard` writing format, it fails directly in GA and can be corrected in a timely manner to avoid omissions. Refer to `Manually check` below.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GA.\r\n- Manually check:\r\n```python\r\nThe usage of between is not standardized, please correct it.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for duplicate key support in the `from_json(_, 'variant')` query pattern. Duplicate key support [has been introduced](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47920) in `parse_json`, json scans and the `from_json` expressions with nested schemas but this code path was not updated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis change makes the behavior of `from_json(_, 'variant')` consistent with every other variant construction expression.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt potentially allows users to use the `from_json(<input>, 'variant')` expression on json inputs with duplicate keys depending on a config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1) The places where I could see the schema being created from UDT Type,  instead of the UDTType, its sql type is used\r\n2) A Logical Plan containing deserializer is being used to serialize ( i.e show the plan as dataframe),  then the target DataType during UpCast, if its of type UDTType, then its sql type is used as target type.\r\nThis is done as a rule in analyzer. I am not sure if that is the best way to handle the issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen showing the schema definition, the UDTType is presented as the ClassName of the UDT Type instead of the sql representation. \r\nFor eg: say message field is a UDT with sql representation as\r\nStructField(\"intField\", IntegerType, nullable = false),\r\nStructField(\"stringField\", StringType, nullable = false)))\r\n\r\nBut the schema contains it as \r\nroot\r\n |-- message: test (nullable = true)\r\n\r\ninstead of \r\nroot\r\n |-- message: struct (nullable = true)\r\n |    |-- intField: integer (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- stringField: string (nullable = false)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes . The schema containing a UDT type will now be represented using its sql type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a bug test. More tests will be added..\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-20T02:38:12Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T22:02:25Z","closed_at":"2024-12-11T22:02:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7ffd3bf37f15e78cb4230fe52d01abec725805b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/589830ef6018d48cb4ddb4b863f1fd2d1e272c8b","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-49690","ref":"SPARK-49690","sha":"589830ef6018d48cb4ddb4b863f1fd2d1e272c8b","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds the following metrics to JSON file scan nodes to collect metrics related to variants being constructed as part of the scan:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariant top-level - total count\r\nvariant top-level - total byte size\r\nvariant top-level - total number of paths\r\nvariant top-level - total number of scalar values\r\nvariant top-level - max depth\r\nvariant nested - total count\r\nvariant nested - total byte size\r\nvariant nested - total number of paths\r\nvariant nested - total number of scalar values\r\nvariant nested - max depth\r\n```\r\nTop level and nested variant metrics are separated as they can have different usage patterns. `singleVariantColumn` scans and columns in user-provided schema scans where the column type is a top level variant (not variant nested in a struct/array/map) are considered to be top level variants while variants nested in other data types are considered to be nested variants.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis change allows users to collect metrics on variant usage to better monitor their data/workloads.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsers will now be able to see variant metrics in JSON scan nodes which were not available earlier.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nComprehensive unit tests in VariantEndToEndSuite.scala\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, got some help related to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWIP\r\n\r\nThis PR adds SQL pipe syntax support for the TABLESAMPLE operator.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE t(x INT, y STRING) USING CSV;\r\nINSERT INTO t VALUES (0, 'abc'), (1, 'def');\r\n\r\nTABLE t\r\n|> TABLESAMPLE (100 PERCENT) REPEATABLE (0)\r\n|> TABLESAMPLE (5 ROWS) REPEATABLE (0)\r\n|> TABLESAMPLE (BUCKET 1 OUT OF 1) REPEATABLE (0);\r\n\r\n0\tabc\r\n1\tdef\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe SQL pipe operator syntax will let users compose queries in a more flexible fashion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few unit test cases, but mostly relies on golden file test coverage. I did this to make sure the answers are correct as this feature is implemented and also so we can look at the analyzer output plans to ensure they look right as well.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo","created_at":"2024-09-19T15:06:11Z","updated_at":"2024-10-02T20:19:09Z","closed_at":"2024-10-02T20:19:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"678bb00df3d799548d512117bacaafcaee6ca7d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48168/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48168/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48168/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f17d814dc10df097e97cc5cd4b33ebcb420d71e","head":{"label":"dtenedor:pipe-tablesample","ref":"pipe-tablesample","sha":"7f17d814dc10df097e97cc5cd4b33ebcb420d71e","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Update the documentation for barh plot to clarify the difference between axis interpretation in Plotly and Matplotlib.\r\n- Test multiple columns as value axis.\r\n\r\nThe parameter difference is demonstrated as below.\r\n```py\r\n>>> df = ps.DataFrame({'lab': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'val': [10, 30, 20]})\r\n>>> df.plot.barh(x='val', y='lab').show()  # plot1\r\n\r\n>>> ps.set_option('plotting.backend', 'matplotlib')\r\n>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n>>> df.plot.barh(x='lab', y='val')\r\n>>> plt.show()  # plot2\r\n```\r\n\r\nplot1\r\n![newplot

Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe barh plot’s x and y axis behavior differs between Plotly and Matplotlib, which may confuse users. The updated documentation and tests help ensure clarity and prevent misinterpretation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. Doc change only.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-09-19T08:09:03Z","updated_at":"2024-09-20T00:36:42Z","closed_at":"2024-09-19T17:09:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90176198fac6697b6f0b2016702316e1df7b0a88","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

If the bound is of first two types, then the data is represented as a BinaryType, while if the bound is of UDT type then schema / behaviour follows UDT Type.\r\n\r\nFollowing things are considered while fixing the issue:\r\n1) Since the concrete class type of the generic parameter is not available, it is not possible to create instance of the class ( during deser), if the bound represents any other type than the 3 mentioned above.\r\n2) Because a  UDT class can appear anywhwere in the bound's hierarchy, all the super classes of the bound ( including the bound) is considered and checked . To create the encoder the preference is  UDTType followed by JavaSerializer or KryoSerializer, whichever shows first.\r\n3) The majority of the code change in JavaTypeInference is a boolean check , to ignore any data type match when considering bound, except UDT and Type Variable ( type variable is included because T <: S  and say S <: Serializable).\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing cases are considered which are sort of boundary cases:\r\n\r\n1) If the generic bean is of type \r\n`\r\nBean[T <: UDTClass] {\r\n @BeanProperty var udt: T = _\r\n\r\n}\r\nThen the UDTEncoder will be created for the field\r\n\r\nBut if the Bean is of type \r\n\r\nBean[T <: UDTDerivedClass] {\r\n @BeanProperty var udt: T = _\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nwhere UDTDerivedClass <: UDTClass\r\nThen a  JavaSerializable encoder will be created , even though the class hierarchy of UDTDerivedClass contains UDTClass. The reason being that concrete instance created by UDTType would be of UDTClass which is not assignable to \r\nUDTDerivedClass\r\n`\r\n\r\nsimilarly for non generic bean class having UDTDerivedClass as bean property will also use Java Serialization encoder. ( added test for the same). The reason for JavaSerializationEncoder is same as that for Generic one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix the regression in spark 3.3 onwards, where the bean having a generic type as return value, throws EncoderNotFoundException.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded bug tests..\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-19T04:02:20Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T20:54:05Z","closed_at":"2024-09-25T20:54:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e7dc0921feca305fd6fff58704ea6bbfbf3b980a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48158/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/48158/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/48158/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/38760061e75a6e8ca6d0cf2308f7e96af417ffcd","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-46679","ref":"SPARK-46679","sha":"38760061e75a6e8ca6d0cf2308f7e96af417ffcd","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror
