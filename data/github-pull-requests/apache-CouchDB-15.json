there was an attempt to shortcut some of the job initialization if replication ID in the job data and the newly computed one matched. However, that logic was wrong as it skipped over the job data state update.\r\n\r\nThe effect was that if a job was in a pending state, and it re-initialized, say when a node restarted, its job data would still indicate it as \"pending\" until the next checkpoint. If the job is continuous, and there are no more updates on the source, the state of the job would stay in \"pending\" indefinitely.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-08T19:36:10Z","updated_at":"2020-10-08T19:45:30Z","closed_at":"2020-10-08T19:45:28Z","merged_at":"2020-10-08T19:45:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b215079ed7130ab741ad3e29d3b674dd9395b52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/f972a27494c558457b7cb600ebc263a52d8efd4b","head":{"label":"apache:do-not-shortcut-job-reinitialization","ref":"do-not-shortcut-job-reinitialization","sha":"f972a27494c558457b7cb600ebc263a52d8efd4b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the JavaScript test suite, the test harness, and all support for the test harness and its options in `couchjs`.\r\n\r\nIt further removes references to `libcurl` from the build process and install documentation, as CouchDB no longer depends on it. In the process I also noticed we no longer require `help2man`, so that is also removed from the INSTALL readme.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make check` should pass on all platforms.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nPossible because of #3192 and all the great work by @jjrodrig , @dottorblaster and many others for converting the suite to Elixir. Great work!\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [X] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [X] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-06T18:49:06Z","updated_at":"2020-10-07T17:29:24Z","closed_at":"2020-10-07T17:29:16Z","merged_at":"2020-10-07T17:29:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b23f20bd70b933988ebeb888cb6d39b308f8742","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"janl","id":11321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzIx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl","html_url":"https://github.com/janl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/janl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3197/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3197/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3197/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/1590f7738169cbf1a3e323c6e0cac208b260177a","head":{"label":"apache:remove-js-harness","ref":"remove-js-harness","sha":"1590f7738169cbf1a3e323c6e0cac208b260177a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

there was an attempt to keep backwards compatibility with 3.x replicator plugins by transforming the auth into a proplist with `maps:to_list/1`. However, that didn't account for nested properties, so we could have ended up with a top level of props with maps for some values. Instead of making things too complicating, and doing a nested transform to proplists, just keep the auth object as a map and let the plugins handle the compatibility

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

During the porting of this test I needed to add support for raw responses to Couch.Session module.\r\n\r\nThis is the last active test to be ported from the javascript test suite. The javascript test suite can be removed from the main build process as there are no more test being ran.

recommendations\r\n`make javascript` All test should be skipped or ported\r\n`make elixir` All test should pass\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour

Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThe smoosh `operator_guide.md` has been updated to use rpc:multicall in the examples. The previous examples used a library not included in CouchDB for some of the rpc commands.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes

are two fixes:\r\n\r\n1)  Fix transient replication job state wait logic\r\n\r\nMake sure to handle both `finished` and `pending` states when waiting for a\r\ntransient jobs. A transient job will go to the `failed` state if it cannot\r\nfetch the filter from the source endpoint. For completeness, we also account\r\nfor `pending` states in there in the remote chance the job get rescheduled\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n2) Fix error reporting when fetching replication filters\r\n\r\nDon't unnecessarily unwrap the fetch error since `error_info/1` can already\r\nhandle the current shape. Also, make sure to translate the reason to binary for\r\nconsistency with the other filter fetching errors in the\r\n`couch_replicator_filters` module.\r\n\r\nThe end-to-end test in the second commits checks the waiting behavior and the error reporting.\r\n","created_at":"2020-09-30T19:59:51Z","updated_at":"2020-09-30T20:55:24Z","closed_at":"2020-09-30T20:55:21Z","merged_at":"2020-09-30T20:55:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"eaf13d35338fa4eecf660879c0b469c1db850a5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3182/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3182/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3182/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/cfc9eeecf4da275aabb8c7d167259e3d8456a7f3","head":{"label":"apache:fix-replicator-filter-fetch-error","ref":"fix-replicator-filter-fetch-error","sha":"cfc9eeecf4da275aabb8c7d167259e3d8456a7f3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nDuring the porting of rewrite_js.js tests into the elixir test suite I've found an erroneous behavior in the JS-rewrite functionality. \r\n\r\nWhen a rewritten request contains a BODY (POST/PUT) and the rewrite rule rewrites the query string, this query string is ignored in the final request. The following case illustrates this issue.\r\n\r\n1 - Create a design document with a rule that rewrites the query string, like this one:\r\n```\r\n {\r\n      \"_id\": \"_design/n\", \r\n      \"rewrites\": \"function (r) { return {path: '../../_changes', query: {'filter': '_doc_ids'}};};\"\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nany request should be rewritten to `_changes?filter=_docs_ids`\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPOST -u adm:pass -H \"Content-type: application/json\" \\\r\n   -d '{\"_id\": \"_design/n\", \"rewrites\": \"function (r) { return {path: '\\''../../_changes'\\'', query: {'\\''filter'\\'': '\\''_doc_ids'\\''}};};\"}' \\\r\n   http://127.0.0.1:15984/test\r\n```\r\n2 - Create a couple of docs\r\n```\r\ncurl -XPUT -u adm:pass -H \"Content-type: application/json\" -d '{}' http://127.0.0.1:15984/test/1 \r\ncurl -XPUT -u adm:pass -H \"Content-type: application/json\" -d '{}' http://127.0.0.1:15984/test/2\r\n```\r\n3 - Perform a POST request to be rewritten\r\n```\r\n curl -XPOST -u adm:pass -H \"Content-type: application/json\" \\\r\n    -d '{\"doc_ids\": [\"2\"]}' \\\r\n     http://127.0.0.1:15984/test/_design/n/_rewrite\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected result for this case is to have only the change for the doc with id 2 in the response, but the full change list is returned. The `filter=_doc_ids` is ignored after the rewritten.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes this behavior and the query string is preserved, so the result for the previous case is the excepted one returning only the change for the doc with id 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\nThe previous test case has been added to rewrite_js.js tests\r\n```\r\n make javascript suites=\"rewrite_js, rewrite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nThis issue #1612

monitors the compactor pid to determine when the compaction jobs\r\nfinishes, and uses this for its idea of concurrency. However, this isn't\r\naccurate in the case where the compaction job has to re-spawn to catch up on\r\nintervening changes since the same logical compaction job continues with\r\nanother pid and smoosh is not aware. In such cases, a smoosh channel with\r\nconcurrency one can start arbitrarily many additional database compaction jobs.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we added a check to see if a compaction PID exists for\r\na db in `start_compact`. But this is the wrong approach because it’s for a\r\nshard that comes off the queue. So it’s a different shard and the following\r\ncan occur:\r\n\r\n1. Enqueue a bunch of stuff into channel with concurrency 1\r\n2. Begin highest priority job, Shard1, in channel\r\n3. Compaction finishes, discovers compaction file is behind main file\r\n4. Smoosh-monitored PID for Shard1 exits, a new one starts to finish the job\r\n5. Smoosh receives the 'DOWN' message, begins the next highest priority job,\r\nShard2\r\n6. Channel concurrency is now 2, not 1\r\n\r\nThis change moves the check into the 'DOWN' message so that we can check for\r\nthat specific shard. If the compaction PID exists then it means a new process\r\nwas spawned and we just monitor that one and add it back to the queue. The\r\nlength of the queue does not change and therefore we won’t spawn new\r\ncompaction jobs.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text.

Overview\r\n\r\nWhen set, every response is sent once fully generated on the server\r\nside.

a\r\ntimeout.\r\n\r\nThe config value can be changed at runtime without impacting any\r\nin-flight responses.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nSet `[chttpd] delay_until_end` to true then

Overview\r\n\r\nReplace the couch_rate rate limiting algorithm with couch_views_batch to dynamically optimize the indexer batch size during view updates.\r\n\r\nWhile working on optimizing couch_views I ran into couch_rate behaving oddly. Reading through the implementation it was nearly impossible to predict how changing various parameters would affect the behavior under load. The rate limiting algorithms were also a bit misapplied. We don't really want a rate \"limiter\" so much as a rate \"maximizer\". \r\n\r\nAfter failing to comprehend couch_rate and realizing that it was missing some fairly important signals (specifically, the approximate transaction size) I decided to take a whack at simplifying things. The new approach is quite a bit simpler and results in the ability to both successfully index large views (1,000,000 doc ranges were tested) but also has a more predictable and simple behavior.\r\n\r\n![batch_size_search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19929/92163250-f6697480-edf8-11ea-9553-9da2be9f1152.png)\r\n\r\nThe graph above is a representative of the behavior. Batch sizes start out small when a view indexer starts. The batch size is quickly ramped up to search for the threshold of a batch size, and then batch sizes are adjusted in much smaller increments to follow the optimal batch size.\r\n\r\nMatching the old behavior of couch_rate to attempt to maintain a consistent transaction time limit can be accomplished trivially by adjusting the `couch_views.batch_tx_max_time` parameter.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make check`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nVarious improvements to ebtree.\r\n\r\nThe `lookup_multi` and `insert_multi` functions exist to minimize the cost of view updates by minimizing the amount of serialization and collation costs.\r\n\r\nNodes are made immutable so that clients can cache nodes to reduce latency due to round trips to foundationdb.\r\n\r\nThe `umerge_members/4` is optimized to avoid the usage of `lists:umerge/3`. This is because `lists:umerge/3` uses a `=<` operation which increases the number of calls to our collation function. By re-implementing using the `lt, eq, gt` return values we can minimize the number of collation calls.\r\n\r\nFinally, we disable `validate_node` in production. This validation is useful during tests but the collation cost is significant during production work loads. A tree can still be validated in production manually.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make check`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously, we passed in the unpacked version of the bookmark with\r\nthe cursor inside the options field. This worked fine for _find because\r\nwe didn't need to return it to the user. But for _explain, we return\r\nthe value back as unpacked tuple instead of a string and jiffy:encode/1\r\ncomplains. Now we correctly extract the bookmark out of options, unpack\r\nit, and then pass it separately in it's own field. This way options\r\nretains it's original string form for the user so that invalid_ejson\r\nis not thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRegression tests should pass. If you create a text index, simply use _explain with a bookmark and verify the results. \r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in

Overview\r\n\r\nThis is a first attempt to assign meaningful categories to tests into our Elixir integration test suite. For now I only modified the `moduletag` attribute on the single modules, once I have some positive feedback on that I'll proceed tagging single test cases.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nJust issue `make elixir` or wait for the CI\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#1885 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [X]

Overview\r\n\r\nDb creation request accepts shard specific parameters q, n and placement, but passes them to fabric without validation. This leads to badarg crash in case of invalid parameter.\r\n\r\nThe patch adds validation on all the parameters and raises error 400 in case of failure.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nA command `$ curl -u $(ADMIN):$(PASS) -X PUT -v \"http://localhost:5984/test?q=\"` should return error `400`\r\n\r\nNew tests added in chttpd_db.erl module:\r\n\r\n`make eunit apps=chttpd
