releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>ICU 71.1</h2>\n<p>We are pleased to announce the release of Unicode® ICU 71.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 updates to <a href=\"https://cldr.unicode.org/index/downloads/cldr-41\">CLDR 41</a> locale data with various additions and corrections.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 adds phrase-based line breaking for Japanese. Existing line breaking methods follow standards and conventions for body text but do not work well for short Japanese text, such as in titles and headings. This new feature is optimized for these use cases.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 adds support for Hindi written in Latin letters (<code>hi_Latn</code>). The CLDR data for this increasingly popular locale has been significantly revised and expanded. Note that based on user expectations, hi_Latn incorporates a large amount of English, and can also be referred to as “Hinglish”.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 and CLDR 41 are minor releases, mostly focused on bug fixes and small enhancements. (The fall CLDR/ICU releases will update to Unicode 15 which is planned for September.) We are also working to re-establish continuous performance testing for ICU, and on development towards future versions.</p>\n<p>ICU 71 updates to the time zone data version 2022a. Note that pre-1970 data for a number of time zones has been removed, as has been the case in the upstream <a href=\"https://www.iana.org/time-zones\">tzdata</a> release since 2021b.</p>\n<p>For details, please see <a href=\"https://icu.unicode.org/download/71\">https://icu.unicode.org/download/71</a>.\nNote: Our website has moved.

We cannot accept pull requests without an issue because the change wouldn't be listed in the release notes.\n* the issue ID (`TIKA-XXXX`)\n  - is referenced in the title of the pull request\n  - and placed in front of your commit messages surrounded by square brackets (`[TIKA-XXXX] Issue or pull request title`)\n* commits are squashed into a single one (or few commits for larger changes)\n* Tika is successfully built and unit tests pass by running `mvn clean test`\n* there should be no conflicts when merging the pull request branch into the *recent* `main` branch. If there are conflicts, please try to rebase the pull request branch on top of a freshly pulled `main` branch\n* if you add new module that downstream users will depend upon add it to relevant group in `tika-bom/pom.xml`.\n\nWe will be able to faster integrate your pull request if these conditions are met.
