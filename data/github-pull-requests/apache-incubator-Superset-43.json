SUMMARY\r\nOn Docker Hub Superset has published over 20k tags so far with most of them not being a release tag. This is a huge amount of unnecessary tags hosted on Docker Hub.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are three scenarios of pushing tags:\r\n\r\n- on PR by Superset committer\r\n```\r\n  Rolling with tags:\r\n  - apache/superset:add536543b3d96774fbdebdc6c36ae286a3a329e\r\n  - apache/superset:elizabeth-fix-examples-load\r\n  - apache/superset:pr-24410\r\n```\r\nexample: https://github.com/apache/superset/actions/runs/5282886796/jobs/9558388071\r\n\r\n  \r\n- on commit to master\r\n```\r\n  Rolling with tags:\r\n  - apache/superset:d5f88c18f61cc919a8bdecfa92251d0d4d35abac\r\n  - apache/superset:master\r\n  - apache/superset:latest\r\n```\r\nexample: https://github.com/apache/superset/actions/runs/5333985229/jobs/9665184088\r\n\r\n- on release\r\n```\r\n  Rolling with tags:\r\n  - apache/superset:2817aebd69dc7d199ec45d973a2079f35e5658b6\r\n  - apache/superset:2.1.0\r\n  - apache/superset:2.1.0\r\n```\r\nexample: https://github.com/apache/superset/actions/runs/4613689991/jobs/8155936157\r\n\r\nThe tags `master` and `latest` are identical. I think `master` can be removed as common practice is to use `latest` tag. Also, the image SHA tags don't seem to be used by any other CI job.\r\nI recommend reducing the pushed image tags to:\r\n\r\n- on PR by Superset committer\r\n```\r\n  Rolling with tags:\r\n  - apache/superset:pr-24410\r\n```\r\n\r\n- on commit to master\r\n```\r\n  Rolling with tags:\r\n  - apache/superset:latest\r\n```\r\n\r\n- on release\r\n```\r\n  Rolling with tags:\r\n  -

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently all databases store physical datasets with normalized column names, and virtual datasets with denormalized column names. This is problematic for Oracle-like databases where the normalized name is typically all lowercase, and the denormalized one is ALL UPPERCASE. This causes issues when using native filters on dashboards, as the column references will be different, depending on whether or not the chart is built on a physical or virtual dataset.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, this PR proposes calling `dialect.denormalize_name()` on dialects that have set the `requires_name_normalize` property to `True`. This ensures that databases like Oracle and Snowflake will have the same case for both physical and virtual datasets.\r\n\r\nWe add a unit test to verify that Oracle changes the case correctly, and that MSSQL doesn't do any conversion. We don't add a Snowflake test, as our current testing requirements don't include the necessary Snowflake drivers, and I don't want to bloat our testing dependencies.\r\n\r\nNote that there's no migration for migrating existing physical datasets, as that would have introduced significant risks. Therefore only datasets created after this PR will be affected. Consequently anyone who wants to migrate old datasets to the new format needs to manyally sync the columns on the dataset modal.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter the change, Snowflake will denormalize column names, typically resulting in ALL UPPERCASE:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/97690263-7752-4391-b11e-91e600a87b3e)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nBefore physical datasets would usually store the column names as all lowercase on Snowflake:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/a25ca91a-2415-4f88-b6d9-a93fd607fb40)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a physical dataset on Snowflake\r\n2. Create a `select * from ...` virtual dataset referencing the same table\r\n3. Notice how one has all lowercase, and the other ALL UPPERCASE.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

Proposal for restructuring the Python code base](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20630) https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24331 organized all the DAOs to be housed within a shared folder‚Äîthe result of which highlighted numerous inconsistencies, repetition, and inefficiencies.\r\n\r\nThis PR (one of many smaller bitesized PRs) replaces the `save` and `overwrite` methods with `create` and `update` methods respectively which removes a bunch of copypasta.\r\n\r\nNote this PR required a fair amount of yak shaving as the `create` and `update` methods needed to be updated to support a combination of a instance and/or the attributes representing the instance.\r\n\r\nFuture fast follows intend to:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the ability to defining properties/attributes when creating or updating.\r\n2. Consolidating the `create` and `update` into an `upsert` method.\r\n3. Provide a mechanism for bulk upsert.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

(`bulk_delete`) logic into a single (`delete`) method which removes a bunch of copypasta and helps to standardize the code.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24331 (as part of [SIP-92 Proposal for restructuring the Python code base](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20630)) I organized the DAOs into a single folder. This highlighted a number of inconsistencies and shortcomings (an expected outcome from centralization) and thus I thought there would be merit if we explicitly mentioned in CONTRIBUTING.md how DAOs should be defined to help improve the code quality and developer experience. \r\n\r\nI've enumerated a few ideas I had, but any additional suggestions are welcome. Note I plan to create a number of followup PRs which should ensure that the current DAOs adhere to these rules.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe exceptions raised within this task are given internationalised messages (flask-babel), which means when the task tries to serialise the exception message to mark the job as failed, it needs to make sure they're rendered first. Cast to str to make that happen.\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue was using lazy_gettext when just using gettext would make more sense, so I've also adjusted the import in a couple of obvious places directly impacting this task to fix it at both ends.\r\n\r\nI've left in the str cast fix as it'd require a much deeper dive to determine if any other edge cases would still result in a lazy message given the complexity of the task.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nSee associated issue for full details.\r\n\r\n1. Configure `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES`\r\n2. Create a virtual dataset from any query\r\n3. Edit the dataset to have invalid SQL, e.g. a syntax error\r\n4. Click through to the charts page\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

for testing. I also added a param in the setup.py script that allows the release manager to pass the rc version to the script, since the current version that we use from the package.json file is the non-rc one. I'm still considering ways that we can put the rc version in the package.json file for each release. The difficulty is then that the voted release needs to be updated after it is voted on. This should suffice, though for now for the Pypi rc packages. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR updates the Superset configuration for npm by adding scarf-js as a dependency. This allows Superset maintainers to collect basic de-identified download and adoption metrics. These metrics include which versions of superset are being installed and the origin of installation (git, etc.). This does not have a runtime footprint and adds no additional dependencies beyond itself. \r\n\r\nThis change was suggested by Superset maintainers in direct discussions. There is also a [pull request](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24432) for updating the Docker compose and helm charts installation methods to retrieve metrics from those pathways. \r\n\r\nScarf purges PII and provides aggregated statistics. Superset users can easily opt out of analytics in various ways documented [here](https://docs.scarf.sh/gateway/#do-not-track) and [here](https://docs.scarf.sh/package-analytics/#as-a-user-of-a-package-using-scarf-js-how-can-i-opt-out-of-analytics). \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTo test this, download Apache Superset using general npm methodology and verify that Apache Superset downloads without issue. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR updates the Superset configuration for helm charts and Docker compose to fetch Superset containers via a Scarf endpoint, so that Superset maintainers can collect basic de-identified download and adoption metrics. It does not affect where the containers are being hosted, as Scarf is only redirecting traffic back to Docker Hub. \r\n\r\nThis change was suggested by Superset maintainers in direct discussions. \r\n\r\nScarf purges PII and provides aggregated statistics. Superset users can easily opt out of analytics in various ways documented [here](https://docs.scarf.sh/gateway/#do-not-track). \r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTo test this, download Apache Superset using the new endpoint (e.g. docker pull apachesuperset.docker.scarf.sh/apache/superset) and verify that the apache/superset container downloads without issue. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

PR updates the Superset configuration for helm charts and Docker compose to fetch Superset containers via a Scarf endpoint, so that Superset maintainers can collect basic de-identified download and adoption metrics. It does not affect where the containers are being hosted, as Scarf is only redirecting traffic back to Docker Hub.\r\n\r\nThis change was suggested by Superset maintainers in direct discussions.\r\n\r\nTESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTo test this, download Apache Superset using the new endpoint (e.g. docker pull apachesuperset.docker.scarf.sh/apache/superset) and verify that the apache/superset container downloads without issue.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n[ ] Has associated issue:\r\n[ ] Required feature flags:\r\n[ ] Changes UI\r\n[ ] Includes DB Migration (follow

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user created a deck.gl Geojson chart, the path was not visible. It turned out that it wasn't really a bug, but the default unit of line width was meters, and a path 1 meter wide was practically invisible on large scale maps. This PR introduces a new control - line width unit, which lets user select if the unit should be meters or pixels. I kept meters as default in order not to break existing charts where users figured out they need to put a large number as line width.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore (line width 1 meter):\r\n<img width=\"1727\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/37a20d78-bf40-429a-99ff-30f3043b158a\">\r\n\r\nAfter (line width 1 pixel):\r\n<img width=\"1728\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/15073128/bb01c056-5080-4c33-9611-45fee30185aa\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR bumps optional dependency `prophet` for the predictive forecasting feature. Prophet made huge performance gains in the last releases https://github.com/facebook/prophet/releases and dropped some dependencies. \r\n\r\n> Sped up .predict() by up to 10x by removing intermediate DataFrame creations.\r\n\r\nAlso bumped `holidays` as needed for prophet. https://github.com/dr-prodigy/python-holidays/releases\r\n\r\nNote: Although prophet worked before and after the bump, their related integration tests still fail https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24406. So this PR may be blocked by this issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nWhile creating a Java Client from the the Superset OpenAPI spec with the OpenAPI codegen, a collision between the `changedOn` and `changed_on` properties in the SQL Lab `QueryRestultSchema` caused an error. This happened because it automatically converts the snake_case property to a camelCase one. This type of overlap doesn't exist in other schemas. In addition, when checking other similar schemas, all the other ones are of type `fields.DateTime`, except `SliceSchema` and `ChartEntityResponseSchema`, which were `fields.String`. For this reason, the redundant `changedOn` property was removed from `QueryResultSchema`, and the type of `changed_on` was updated to `DateTime` for `QueryResultSchema`, `SliceSchema` and `ChartEntityResponseSchema`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when looking at the SQL Lab code, I noticed inconsistencies in the test fixtures and the reducer:\r\n- The `SouthPane` test didn't have `changed_on` in the fixture, only `changedOn`. Furthermore, the type was wrong - the fixture had an epoch, while the value is in fact an ISO8601 string (see screenshot).  These were updated.\r\n- The `SqlLab` fixture also showed the `changedOn` property as an epoch. However, the `changed_on` property there was in correct format, i.e. ISO-8601 string. To comply with the updated schema, `changedOn` was removed.\r\n- the SQL Lab reducer was comparing the ISO-8601 string value of `changedOn` with an epoch-valued `queriesLastUpdate`. I'm not sure what kind of results that resulted in, but to fix this, we now refer to `changed_on`, and convert it to epoch format first before doing the comparison.\r\n\r\nThis inconsistency in types has been verified on both a SQLite and Postgres metastore backend, so it shouldn't be affected by the metastore's temporal column logic.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\nCurrently on master, the values of `changedOn` and `changed_on` are identical in the query response:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/ba5df2b0-bb96-4f48-8df0-869f642f86c1)\r\n\r\nNotice how `queriesLastUpdate` is an epoch, but `changedOn` which it's being compared to in the reducer is an ISO-8601 string?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/5ed2943a-b211-4fc9-91cf-65a0451cc829)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/33317356/dee08ef5-3626-45fc-9e50-9d3a9a663b90)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a fix for https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14710 in addition to being an alternative formulation for https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24413. Additionally it provides `LIKE` and `ILIKE` operator support for SIMPLE ad-hoc filters irrespective of the column type, i.e., now all operators are valid.\r\n\r\nThis change came about give how https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/14710 implemented dynamic (backend) filtering of numerical values for native filters.\r\n\r\nHypothetically lets assume there was an `id` column which comprised of the set of integers from 0 to 100,000 and a user searched for `100`, then:\r\n\r\n1. A backend query was sent with a SIMPLE filter of the form `{col: 'id', op: '>=', val: 100}`.\r\n2. The result set (limited to 1,000) would contain the values: 100, 101, 102, ..., 1,097, 1,098, 1,099\r\n3. The frontend select filter would filter out any result not match the `100` substring resulting in only 10 matches: 100, 1,001, 1,002, 1,003, 1,004, 1,005, 1,006, 1,007, 1,008, 1,009.\r\n4. Numerous valid matches like 1,100, 2,100, 10,000, etc. aren't shown as they're not part of the corpus of 1,000 results fetched from the backend.\r\n\r\nThe right way to see if a number is contained within another number is to treat the numbers as a string and provide a filter of the form  `{col: 'id', op: 'ILIKE', val: '%100%'}`. This also remedies the BIGINT issue where in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/24413 the numerical values were treated as a string.\r\n\r\nThe ad-hoc filters include the `ILIKE` and `LIKE` operator which work exclusively with `STRING` types. This PR simply provides \"support\" for using both these operators by casting the column (if necessary) to a `STRING`, i.e., it means that the `ILIKE` and `LIKE` operator work for all SIMPLE filters irrespective of the column type, which can then be leveraged by the native filter search functionality.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### BEFORE\r\n\r\n<img width=\"243\"

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdd support for using the [SQL Templating - Custom Url Parameters](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/sql-templating/#available-macros) feature in embedded dashboards, as requested in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/17187#issuecomment-1042907319.\r\n\r\nThis was also implemented in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20259 and https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23344, but both pull-requests seem to be stale and with reviewers concerns not fully addressed.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this adds the `urlParams` option to the `dashboardUiConfig`:\r\n```js\r\nimport { embedDashboard } from \"@superset-ui/embedded-sdk\";\r\n\r\nembedDashboard({\r\n  id: \"abc123\", // given by the Superset embedding UI\r\n  supersetDomain: \"https://superset.example.com\",\r\n  mountPoint: document.getElementById(\"my-superset-container\"), // any html element that can contain an iframe\r\n  fetchGuestToken: () => fetchGuestTokenFromBackend(),\r\n  dashboardUiConfig: { // dashboard UI config: hideTitle, hideTab, hideChartControls, filters.visible, filters.expanded (optional), urlParams (optional)\r\n      hideTitle: true,\r\n      filters: {\r\n          expanded: true,\r\n      },\r\n      urlParams: {\r\n          foo: 'value1',\r\n          bar: 'value2',\r\n          // ...\r\n      }\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

leads to  no tag showing in navbar\r\n- `unset SUPERSET_ENV` leads to `flask-debug` tag in navbar\r\n- `export SUPERSET_ENV=giberrish` leads to `flask-debug` tag in navbar\r\n- tested custom

SUMMARY\r\nRemoves old deprecated APIs:\r\n- `/superset/recent_activity/...` \r\n- `/superset/fave_dashboards_by_username/...`\r\n- `/superset/fave_dashboards/...`\r\n- `/superset/created_dashboards/...`\r\n- `/superset/user_slices/...`\r\n- `/superset/created_slices/...`\r\n- `/superset/fave_slices/...`\r\n- `/superset/favstar/...`\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes `ENABLE_BROAD_ACTIVITY_ACCESS` feature flag (was disabled by default), since by removing the above mentioned deprecated API's only one final API ( `/api/v1/log/recent_activity/` ) was using it.\r\nAlso removes `changed_by_url` and `created_by_url` REST API response fields from datasets, dashboards and charts, since these fields function was to provide a link to other user's profiles.\r\n\r\nEffort on removing deprecated APIs from `/superset`: https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/24332\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

SUMMARY\r\nmain goals here are:\r\n- remove eslint warnings - take a more opinionated error or don't, no warn as the warnings are polluting the output and making linting more noisy\r\n- generally bumping libs\r\n- fixing some things to comply\r\n- disabling where needed (can always be re-enabled)\r\n- silence all warnings as they prevent us from being able to actually consume the lint reports

SUMMARY\r\nDue to long standing issues with Superset's redux store, recently introduced redux-toolkit produces hundreds of console errors related to violating state immutability and saving un-serializable objects. Though the errors are accurate, they make development work harder due to cluttering the browser console. This PR disables the Redux middleware responsible for issuing those errors by default.\r\nIf you'd like to enable those errors to work on improving the Redux state, you can do that by setting env variable `REDUX_DEFAULT_MIDDLEWARE` to true. To do that, you can run frontend with the following script:\r\n```\r\nREDUX_DEFAULT_MIDDLEWARE=true npm run dev-server\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\nexport REDUX_DEFAULT_MIDDLEWARE=true\r\nnpm run dev-server\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

an issue in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/23586 where previously the necessary dashboard access checks were a combination of logic which resided in the security manager as well as the view with conflicting logic. This was problematic say if a user was deemed to have access to a dashboard (from a security perspective) but was then denied within the view which relied on additional dataset access checks meaning it was near impossible to bypass with custom security logic.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply moves the entirety of the permission checks to the security manager.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

the Metric field in the dataset's metric list. It seems critical to let the user know how this is used.\r\n\r\nI don't think this is  how we want this to work (user-provided name as a unique key to associate with charts, but somehow is important to let the user know about it)\r\n\r\nLonger term, we should use UUIDs for metrics internally and rename this \"Metric Alias\" or just get rid of it.","created_at":"2023-06-10T00:46:20Z","updated_at":"2024-03-08T17:30:57Z","closed_at":"2023-06-13T01:32:15Z","merged_at":"2023-06-13T01:32:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd77aacc513679caafe029964a3ef0d81cef3a9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"üè∑Ô∏è

a combination of lazyload and load_only to ensure sqlalchemy doesn't eagerly join to additional tables, which was happening in a very inefficient way for a large number of tables and resulting in this endpoint never returning (in addition to high db load)\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nMakes the lookup for `extra` for tables listed by schema much more efficient, especially when there is a large number of tables present.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Populate a few thousand datasources for tables in a schema you want to list\r\n2. Go to SQL Lab and try to get the table list for your selected schema\r\n3. Observe the call times out as the API responds in a timely manner\r\n\r\nMore info on the associated issue: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/24343\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR is the first of many to related to [SIP-92 Proposal for restructuring the Python code base](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20630). Specifically it organizes all the DAOs under the `superset/daos` subfolder. A few things of note:\r\n\r\n1. The `EmbeddedDAO` was renamed `EmbeddedDashboardDAO` for clarity.\r\n2. The organization is flat from a directory standpoint (akin to @ktmud's suggestion in the SIP) as opposed to tiered. This means that there was consolidation of DAOs by theme:\r\n  - `AnnotationLayerDAO` is housed in `daos/annotation.py`\r\n  - `EmbeddedDashboardDAO` and `FilterSetDAO` are housed in `daos/dashboard.py`\r\n  - `SavedQueryDAO` is housed in `daos/query.py`\r\n  - `SSHTunnelDAO` is housed in `daos/database.py`\r\n3. It wasn't overly clear whether the modules should use [singular or plural](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/75929) forms, i.e., `dashboard` or `dashboards`. I opted for the former given that:\r\n  - They're already housed under `daos` (plural) subfolder.\r\n  - Even though the `dashboard.py` file contains a collection of DAOs (`DashboardDAO`, `EmbeddedDashboardDAO`) we _tend_ to think of the term \"dashboard\" as a concept/type rather than multiple types.\r\n  - It seems prudent to stick with either singular or plural from a consistency standpoint‚Äîthe one exception is (no pun intended) `exceptions` as this houses different exception types and is consistent with how other files containing exceptions are named.\r\n4. Apart from singularizing the terms the follow renames occurred:\r\n  - `css_templates/dao.py` became `daos/css.py`\r\n  - `row_level_security/dao.py` became `daos/security.py`\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER
