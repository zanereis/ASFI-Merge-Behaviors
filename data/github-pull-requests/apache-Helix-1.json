The GC occurs on an async thread, so it is possible that GC is occurring but deletion of Znodes has not yet completed so read is served before deletion is written to ZK server. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces 3 changes to TestZkBucketDataAcessor.testGCScheduler\r\n1. Rename testGCScheduler --> testGCCompletesUnderHighFrequency \r\n2. Assertion logic has changed. No longer has strict check that can be flaky due to slow ZK connection. Now leverages verifier that will continuously write to ZK shorter than GC timeout and will only exist once GC has occurred. This maintains test logic that GC will occur under high frequency writes.\r\n3. Isolates paths between test methods\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestGCCompletesUnderHighFrequency\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO]  T E S T S\r\n[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Running org.apache.helix.manager.zk.TestZkBucketDataAccessor\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 6.113 s - in org.apache.helix.manager.zk.TestZkBucketDataAccessor\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] fixes https://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2945\r\n- [x] Fix ConstrainBasedAlgorithm global shuffling when only updating on instance tag groups DOMAIN\r\n- [x] Fix a incorrect condition in swap impl to avoid adding state value of null to stateMap of bestPossibleAssignment\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFixing the flaky topology migration check which should isolate shuffling to a single instance tag. After investigation, a fix was needed for ContraintBasedAlgorithm to compute the replica hash using only the assignable instances for a given instance tag. This is to ensure that cluster topology changes to instances with specific tags only affects resources with those tags.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] TestTopologyMigration\r\n\r\n```\r\n

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFeature warranted by discussion from PR #2932 \r\nDiscussion here: https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2932#discussion_r1868312803\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an ATOMIC recursive delete method and uses it for dropping/purging instances from the cluster. The deleteRecursivelyAtomic method will either fully fail or fully succeed. This will prevent partially deleted instances from entering the cluster into an invalid state. This behaves similarly to the current deleteRecursively method, but with the addition of atomicity. There are two signatures available, one for deleting a single path and its children, and one for deleting multiple paths and all their children. Atomicity across different paths is needed to ensure atomicity of dropping an instance. \r\n\r\nThe FederatedZkClient implementation throws an IllegalArgumentException when deleteRecursivelyAtomic is called upon 2 paths that exist in different ZK realms as atomicity cannot be guaranteed across different realms due to their being 2 separate ZKClients and therefore 2 separate calls. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestDropInstance in TestZkHelixAdmin.java\r\ntestDeleteRecursivelyAtomic in TestRawZkClient.java\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\nRan manual CI on my personal fork and saw no new failing tests introduced. \r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-13T19:35:22Z","updated_at":"2025-01-28T01:25:12Z","closed_at":"2025-01-28T01:25:12Z","merged_at":"2025-01-28T01:25:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"892fc2710c994261ccc46236c3ff9d66c2af32ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2994/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2994/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2994/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/696a245845dd0fc94b73293ad51c0844eb6f45e9","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:atomic-drop-instance","ref":"atomic-drop-instance","sha":"696a245845dd0fc94b73293ad51c0844eb6f45e9","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2992 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThis PR helps skiping instances/partition/aggregated custom checks if the instance is not alive. It adds a new configuration parameter skipCustomChecksIfNotLiveness. By default, it is false to maintain the backward compatibility. If the user configure it to be true, dead instances will skip any custom checks.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n- `mvn test -Dtest=TestInstancesAccessor,TestMaintenanceManagementService,TestInstanceValidationUtilInRest,TestPerInstanceAccessor,TestCustomRestClient -pl helix-res\r\nt && mvn test -Dtest=TestInstanceValidationUtil -pl helix-core\r\n`\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-13T14:50:38Z","updated_at":"2025-01-21T19:20:45Z","closed_at":"2025-01-21T19:20:45Z","merged_at":"2025-01-21T19:20:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6adf5bc934a01ab87bc44c03015208a45ca6b4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2993/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2993/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2993/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/99f476b704f49fcb39955af6f3430ea6649e1d7d","head":{"label":"MarkGaox:markgaox/skip-custom-checks-for-non-alive-instances","ref":"markgaox/skip-custom-checks-for-non-alive-instances","sha":"99f476b704f49fcb39955af6f3430ea6649e1d7d","user":{"login":"MarkGaox","id":32374858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzc0ODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32374858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkGaox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":669317399,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ-T5Fw","name":"helix","full_name":"MarkGaox/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MarkGaox","id":32374858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzc0ODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32374858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkGaox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MarkGaox/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Support preserving history of HELIX_ENABLED legacy fields when combo of instance operation and old helix version are used\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWhen the new instance operation APIs are used, we need to consider that an older version of helix could have been used to modify the legacy fields of HELIX_ENABLED, HELIX_DISABLED_TYPE, and HELIX_DISABLED_REASON. When this happens, we need to write those legacy fields to the USER source instance operation to preserve the history when another source sets the instance operation. When the other source re-enables the instance, we should restore the old legacy fields with what was previously set.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] Added to test TestInstanceConfig#testEnabledInstanceBackwardCompatibility\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- Yes, will add more information\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2985\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR support zone based virtual topology assignment algorithm. In the rest service, introduced a configurable parameter enabling users to select the desired virtual topology assignment algorithm (e.g.,instance_based or zone_based). Additionally, implemented a zone-based assignment algorithm that directly maps physical zones to virtual zones.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n```\r\n mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip.exec=true\r\n```\r\n```\r\nmvn test -Dtest=TestVirtualTopologyGroupService,TestFaultZoneBasedVirtualGroupAssignment,TestClusterService,TestVirtualTopologyGroupAssignment,TestClusterAccessor -pl helix-rest\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- This PR doesn't have backward compatibility issue.\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2965\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIf two nodes try to register at about the same time in the cluster, there may be a race condition while effectively adding the instances to the cluster description in zookeeper (the second one seeing an incomplete node hierarchy and later on refusing to accept tasks). Having an atomic creation of those nodes in zookeeper should prevent that.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo additional tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFixes #2963\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn case _helixManager in one of the known controllers is _null_, finding the \"leader controller\" can lead to a NPE.\r\nI added a check for _helixManager member's nullity in the helix controller before using it to determine if a controller is leader or not.\r\n\r\nWhen run as an asynchronous task, the NPE may not even be logged, and the task abruptly finishes without any trace, hence the addition of ExecutorTaskUtil class to wrap callables/runnables in such a manner that such an exception at least gets logged.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nNo added tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-06T09:37:53Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T06:32:55Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f0bd8bc17451e4d395a42be4fb9b0a84a304e848","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2977/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2977/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2977/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/e8d1432b35ecb4f74b218c092abadaf422eb7b90","head":{"label":"jacob-netguardians:bugfix/2963-fix-npe-while-rebalancing-task","ref":"bugfix/2963-fix-npe-while-rebalancing-task","sha":"e8d1432b35ecb4f74b218c092abadaf422eb7b90","user":{"login":"jacob-netguardians","id":93510951,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZLdJw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93510951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians","html_url":"https://github.com/jacob-netguardians","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":890835952,"node_id":"R_kgDONRkT8A","name":"helix","full_name":"jacob-netguardians/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jacob-netguardians","id":93510951,"node_id":"U_kgDOBZLdJw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/93510951?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians","html_url":"https://github.com/jacob-netguardians","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jacob-netguardians/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jacob-netguardians/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2971\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nController endlessly creates best possible nodes under certain circumstances due handle`handleDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica` modifying the same underlying ResourceAssignments that are used for the in memory bestPossibleAssignment\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `AssignmentMetadataStore`'s methods `persistBaseline` and `persistBestPossibleAssignment` to create a copy of the underlying `ResourceAssignment` objects before persisting them to the store's in-memory map. This allows the object passed to these methods to be safely modified afterwards without affecting the cached bestPossible. \r\n\r\nThere are specific circumstances to trigger this behavior:\r\n1. Cluster is in state to require delyRebalance overwrites (nodes are disabled within delay window and partitions are violating minActiveReplica count)\r\n2. Change cluster so that partialRebalance will calculate a new assignment (adding or removing instances)\r\n\r\nPartialRebalance will async calculate a new best possible and increment the `_bestPossibleVersion` and schedule an onDemandPipeline run. In emergencyRebalance(...) of the next pipeline, the bestPossibleAssignment (object A) will be persisted as `_bestPossibleVersion` != `_lastPersistedBestPossibleVersion`. The values of the new best possible are stored in our in-memory bestPossibleAssignment map (object B). While object A and B are different, their values map to the same objects. We then pass object A to `handleDelayedRebalanceMinActiveReplica` which modifies the values of object A, also modifying the values of object B. This causes partialRebalance to believe it has calculated a different assignment, so it triggers a new pipeline run which will repeat the above behavior ad infinitum.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestEndlessBestPossibleNodes\r\nThis test will fail on master, but pass on this branch\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestEndlessBestPossibleNodes -pl=helix-core \r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 15.512 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestEndlessBestPossibleNodes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  53.849 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-11-26T15:52:41-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nNPE occurs for first WAGED resource in cluster after previous WAGED resources have been removed\r\n#2891 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFull description of the NPE can be found in the issue #2891. Here is a brief summary:\r\n1. `_instanceCapacityMap` is calculated with WAGED resources in cluster\r\n2. If you remove all WAGED resources, the previous `_instanceCapacityMap` is still present. This is only recalculated under certain conditions\r\n3. If you add a new WAGED resource, the `_instanceCapacityMap` is not recalculated before it is used. This stale `_instanceCapacityMap` can lead to an NPE\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the above issue by ensuring the `_instanceCapacityMap` is null whenever there are no WAGED resources in the cluster. This leads to the map being recalculated before it is used when a new WAGED resource is added.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nNew test class: `TestWagedNPE`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestWagedNPE -pl=helix-core\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 11.836 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.TestWagedNPE\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  35.815 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-11-25T10:09:46-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n* Add a new selection base: NON_TOPO_BASED. In this scenario, the order of the zone will not be respected and all instances will be performed stoppable check at once. Additionally, this change supports the stoppable check for non-topo aware clusters.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n` mvn test -Dtest=TestInstancesAccessor,TestMaintenanceManagementService,TestInstanceValidationUtilInRest,TestPerInstanceAccessor,TestCustomRestClient,TestClusterService -pl helix-rest && mvn test -Dtest=TestInstanceValidationUtil -pl helix-core`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-12T01:30:51Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T22:31:24Z","closed_at":"2024-12-11T22:31:24Z","merged_at":"2024-12-11T22:31:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"33a28e761b9dd8d1ac790121a0dcae55f30e07f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2961/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2961/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2961/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/39cf5ae3a832fe70fcafa951a1b14d5ff30e625a","head":{"label":"MarkGaox:markgaox/support-non-topology-aware-stoppable-check","ref":"markgaox/support-non-topology-aware-stoppable-check","sha":"39cf5ae3a832fe70fcafa951a1b14d5ff30e625a","user":{"login":"MarkGaox","id":32374858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzc0ODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32374858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkGaox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":669317399,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ-T5Fw","name":"helix","full_name":"MarkGaox/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MarkGaox","id":32374858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzc0ODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32374858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkGaox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MarkGaox/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2957\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n> When a Workflow is marked as deleted (TargetState.DELETE) via TaskDriver.delete API, then in the workflow is deleted by the pipeline in the next run. With deletion, the entries from ZK is deleted and the TaskDataCache is also updated. However, the other entries are still present in ResourceConfig (Base) cache. Usually, the next event which is in the pipeline is the ResourceConfigChange Event, which takes care of the resourceConfig cache update, but in case of a very busy cluster, other change event might be earlier in the pipeline than ResourceConfigChange event. Now, the ResourceConfig cache is updated selectively and not always so the ResourceConfig cache keeps the deleted workflow entries, and when the Workflow (TaskDataCache) is prepared, these (previously deleted) workflow entries comes back in again. This causes, same workflows to be deleted multiple times. (Until we see the ResourceConfigChange or OnDemandRebalance event).\r\n\r\n> In Busy Cluster, the resourceConfig cache can take time to be eventually consistent and this causes duplicate deletes of the same workflow.\r\n\r\n- [x] Impact\r\n> Some customers delete and re-create workflow with same name and this behavior causes the recently deleted workflow to be deleted again (unexpectedly).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\norg.apache.helix.integration.task.TestDeleteWorkflow#testDeleteWorkflowAndRecreate\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```console\r\nmvn test -Dtest=TestDeleteWorkflow -pl=helix-core \r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 30.505 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.task.TestDeleteWorkflow\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/hkandwal/Documents/workspaces/projects/helix_os_hk/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 957 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  48.378 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-11-03T15:10:56-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-03T23:11:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-27T22:34:30Z","closed_at":"2025-01-27T22:34:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c00db2aca2cd14fe07ec69ec77da0d1878118e66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/7b2b6e5159e20e269ab80511f8dd1c458284c7b9","head":{"label":"himanshukandwal:hkandwal/workflow-deletion-behavior","ref":"hkandwal/workflow-deletion-behavior","sha":"7b2b6e5159e20e269ab80511f8dd1c458284c7b9","user":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":676756685,"node_id":"R_kgDOKFZ8zQ","name":"helix","full_name":"himanshukandwal/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"himanshukandwal","id":2539436,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mzk0MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2539436?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal","html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/himanshukandwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/himanshukandwal/helix","description":"Mirror

We can achieve it by `_resources.clear()`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThe current test should be enough to capture this.\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nNew feature for allowing controller to purge participants that have been offline for greater than user defined timeout.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nParticipants can automatically join a Helix cluster when they startup. However when they permanently go down, they must be manually removed or purged by an external workflow in order to actually leave the cluster. These stale participants can have significant negative impact on the clusters in at least 2 ways:\r\n* `MAX_OFFLINE_INSTANCES_ALLOWED` - If this cluster level config is exceeded, then the cluster will be put into maintenance mode. \r\n* `CRUSHED Calculations` - CRUSHED only guarantees evenness when all nodes in a cluster are online. The more offline nodes in the cluster, the larger the max degree of unevenness that is possible.\r\nThis causes Helix's view of the cluster's health and the actual health of the cluster to diverge.  \r\n\r\nCode Changes:\r\n * Added `PARTICIPANT_DEREGISTRATION_ENABLED` and `PARTICIPANT_DEREGISTRATION_TIMEOUT` properties to `ClusterConfig`. \r\n * Added ParticipantDeregistration Stage to handle logic of removing participants that have been offline greater than customer configured timeout. \r\n     - This stage will schedule a follow-up onDemandRebalance to deregister participants that are currently offline but have not yet exceeded the deregister timeout\r\n  * Updated `ZkTestBase` with addParticipant and dropParticipant methods to be leveraged across different test classes.\r\n     - Subsequently changed `TestAddResourceWhenRequireDelayedRebalanceOverwrite.java` and `TestForceKillInstance.java` to leverage these changes. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nTestParticipantDeregistrationStage.java\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestParticipantDeregistrationStage -pl=helix-core\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:32 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2025-01-27T14:19:05-08:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nN/A. Feature is optional and is default off\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2929 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nRefactor to isolate test paths. If test method run order varies between runners, my assumption is that `testGetStat` is culprit because it creates 2 nodes when it calls create on: \"/path/getStat\" (/path and /path/getStat), but it only deletes node when it calls remove on: \"/path/getStat\" (/path/getStat), leaving the \"/path\" node behind. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\nN/A\r\nTriggered multiple CI runs on my personal fork, will update PR once they are done. \r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestZooKeeperAccessor -pl=helix-rest\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  01:28 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-09-30T16:22:11-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2925 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrent test logic has strict assertion that GC should occur within 2*TTL of making the write calls. I believe the flakiness is due to this assertion being too strict and causes the test to fail when the CI's ZK server is overloaded and responses are slowed. The gc occurs on a separate thread so it may be delayed compared to the main test thread. \r\n\r\nThis change increases the test timeout to 60s as the test should be isolated from the performance of the ZK server. \r\nThis change also removes a redundant assertion\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestMultipleWrites\r\n\r\nRan this change vs master on my personal fork, test frequently occurred on master but not on this branch\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-23T23:54:15Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T21:28:09Z","closed_at":"2024-09-25T21:28:09Z","merged_at":"2024-09-25T21:28:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"04a2400eef4b32945c2f40ff947b3b29719d4658","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2926/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2926/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2926/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/d3fa11a7dd3e1eb11fac5f75e7bc2b4d5b8c30a0","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:flakyTest-multiple-writes","ref":"flakyTest-multiple-writes","sha":"d3fa11a7dd3e1eb11fac5f75e7bc2b4d5b8c30a0","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2918\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n* This PR supports the aggregated customized stoppable check.\r\n* When configuring the RESTConfig with an specific URI (e.g., \"https://*:123\"), users means to use the aggregated health check instead of the instance/partition level checks. \r\n* The aggregated health check will pass `instances`, `toBeStoppedInstances`, and the `clusterID` to the health check endpoint and expect the user to return the response regarding whether those instances are stoppable and the reason of being not stoppable. \r\n* Support Redirect of request if receiving status code of 302 with max retry of 3 times.\r\n* Following is an expected request + response:\r\n```\r\n     example url: POST http://<baseUrl>/aggregatedHealthStatus -d {\r\n       \"instances\" : [\"n1\", \"n3\", \"n5\", \"n9\"],\r\n       \"to_be_stopped_instances\": \"[\"n2\", \"n4\"]\",\r\n       \"cluster_id\": \"cluster1\",\r\n       \"<key>\": \"<value>\"\r\n     ...\r\n     }\r\n     example response:\r\n     {\r\n       \"stoppableInstances\": [\"n1\", \"n3\"],\r\n       \"nonStoppableInstancesWithReasons\": {\r\n       \"n5\": \"reason1,reason2\",\r\n       \"n9\": \"reason3\"\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n ```\r\nmvn test -Dtest=TestInstancesAccessor,TestMaintenanceManagementService,TestInstanceValidationUtilInRest,TestPerInstanceAccessor,TestCustomRestClient -pl helix-rest && mvn test -Dtest=TestInstanceValidationUtil -pl helix-core\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-09-12T23:08:24Z","updated_at":"2024-09-25T16:31:41Z","closed_at":"2024-09-25T16:31:41Z","merged_at":"2024-09-25T16:31:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"2de4177833e22050723651d7b5277ff78d9a3a60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2919/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2919/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2919/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/eddaffa2f1c1607ec0590b534032f7239627ddd3","head":{"label":"MarkGaox:markgaox/cluster-level-stoppable-check","ref":"markgaox/cluster-level-stoppable-check","sha":"eddaffa2f1c1607ec0590b534032f7239627ddd3","user":{"login":"MarkGaox","id":32374858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzc0ODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32374858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkGaox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":669317399,"node_id":"R_kgDOJ-T5Fw","name":"helix","full_name":"MarkGaox/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MarkGaox","id":32374858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzc0ODU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32374858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox","html_url":"https://github.com/MarkGaox","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MarkGaox/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MarkGaox/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n#2909 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nResources that are in the resourceMap but not in the current assignment will return an empty currentAssignment rather than a null object. \r\n\r\n**Code Changes**\r\n* `helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/controller/rebalancer/util/DelayedRebalanceUtil.java`: Updated `findToBeAssignedReplicasForMinActiveReplica` method to use `getOrDefault` when fetching resource assignments, an empty `ResourceAssignment` is created if one does not exist in the current assignment map. \r\n\r\n* `helix-core/src/test/java/org/apache/helix/integration/TestAddResourceWhenRequireDelayedRebalanceOverwrite.java`: Added a new test class to reproduce the issue linked above.  \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n`helix-core/src/test/java/org/apache/helix/integration/TestAddResourceWhenRequireDelayedRebalanceOverwrite.java`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n```\r\nmvn test -o -Dtest=TestAddResourceWhenRequireDelayedRebalanceOverwrite -pl=helix-core\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run:

all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nFailing tests in CI:\r\n#2901\r\n#2902\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFrom #2877 , autoRebalanceStrategy now reads the idealState and StateModelDefinition from the cache. This causes an NPE when computing the potential assignment. `getIdealAssignmentForFullAuto` instantiates a cache (`ResourceControllerDataProvider`) and only instantiates the necessary values. I'm assuming this was done as an optimization and to avoid a full cache refresh. My change adds the other necessary fields to the cache for the calculation to complete. It's also possible to fully reresh the cache, but I believe this would require changing public constructors in order to pass the accessor down to the relevant method.\r\n\r\nHere is the NPE trace:\r\n```\r\n1271778 [qtp462777594-3583] ERROR org.apache.helix.rest.server.resources.helix.ResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor [] - Failed to compute partition assignment\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: null\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.controller.rebalancer.strategy.AutoRebalanceStrategy.calculateExpectedReplicaCount(AutoRebalanceStrategy.java:643) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.controller.rebalancer.strategy.AutoRebalanceStrategy.computePartitionAssignment(AutoRebalanceStrategy.java:111) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.controller.rebalancer.strategy.AutoRebalanceStrategy.computePartitionAssignment(AutoRebalanceStrategy.java:44) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.util.HelixUtil.getIdealAssignmentForFullAuto(HelixUtil.java:409) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.rest.server.resources.helix.ResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor.computeOptimalAssignmentForResources(ResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor.java:287) ~[classes/:?]\r\n\tat org.apache.helix.rest.server.resources.helix.ResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor.computePotentialAssignment(ResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor.java:147) ~[classes/:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nCode changes:\r\n* `helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/controller/dataproviders/BaseControllerDataProvider.java`: Added a new method `setStateModelDefMap` to allow manually setting the cache's state model definition map. \r\n* `helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/util/HelixUtil.java`: Modified the initialization of `ResourceControllerDataProvider` to include setting the state model definition map and ideal states, which are now necesasry fields\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\nTest passes on this branch:\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor,TestPartitionAssignmentAPI -pl=helix-rest\r\n\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 6, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 164.565 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:52 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-09-05T15:46:33-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest will fail on current master:\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor,TestPartitionAssignmentAPI -pl=helix-rest\r\n\r\nFailed run\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 6, Failures: 2, Errors: 0, Skipped: 2, Time elapsed: 158.233 s <<< FAILURE! - in TestSuite\r\n[ERROR] testComputePartitionAssignment(org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor)  Time elapsed: 0.496 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<200> but was:<400>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor.testComputePartitionAssignment(TestResourceAssignmentOptimizerAccessor.java:111)\r\n\r\n[ERROR] testComputePartitionAssignmentMaintenanceMode(org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestPartitionAssignmentAPI)  Time elapsed: 19.54 s  <<< FAILURE!\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: expected:<200> but was:<400>\r\n        at org.apache.helix.rest.server.TestPartitionAssignmentAPI.testComputePartitionAssignmentMaintenanceMode(TestPartitionAssignmentAPI.java:453)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nN/A - New feature to forcefully kill an instance\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new feature, a HelixAdmin and Helix-rest API command to forcefully kill an instance. This is achieved by marking the instance's operation as UNKNOWN and then deleting the LIVEINSTANCE znode. This feature is intended for use in a scenario where the participant is in an unrecoverable state but is keeping an active connection with ZK. Marking the node as UNKNOWN will remove it from calculations and subsequently deleting the LIVEINSTANCE znode will cause the controller to consider it as OFFLINE. This skips the requirement that the node must process the downward state transition for topstate handoff to occur. \r\n\r\nMy current findings indicate that the LIVEINSTANCE znode will only be recreated on ZK session establishment, which occurs on initial connection and after session expiration. \r\n\r\n#### The following code changes were made:\r\n\r\n* `helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/HelixAdmin.java`: Added `forceKillInstance` method to the HelixAdmin interface.\r\n* `helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/manager/zk/ZKHelixAdmin.java`: Implemented the `forceKillInstance` method in the ZKHelixAdmin class.\r\n* `helix-rest/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/rest/server/resources/helix/PerInstanceAccessor.java`: Added forceKillInstance command to the to the REST API updateInstance endpoint.

for the Helix Gateway service. The main changes include:\r\n\r\n1. Addition of a new `GatewayCurrentStateCache` class in `GatewayCurrentStateCache.java`, which manages caching of current and target states for instances in a cluster.\r\n\r\n2. Modification of `GatewayServiceManager.java` to incorporate the new caching functionality:\r\n   - A new `_currentStateCacheMap` is added to store `GatewayCurrentStateCache` objects for each cluster.\r\n   - A new method `getCurrentStateCache(String clusterName)` is introduced to retrieve or create a cache for a given cluster.\r\n\r\n### Test\r\n\r\nA new test class `TestGatewayCurrentStateCache.java` has been added with the following tests:\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n*Created with

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nFixes #2885 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen determining which replica to drop between 2 replicas that are not in the preference list, controller should consider the fault zone representation. The controller should prioritize dropping a replica in a fault zone that already has another copy of the replica existing in it. If the controller drops a replica from a fault zone that already has another replica in it, then we will not decrease the # of fault zones where replicas for the partition exist.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] Determine if sorting by MZ should only be done if the replica states are the same. With current change, sorting by MZ takes precedence of sorting by state for replicas that are both not in the preference list.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n`TestPreferenceListNodeComparatorWithTopologyAware.java`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestPreferenceListNodeComparatorWithTopologyAware -pl=helix-core\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  29.011 s\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-08-28T21:30:03-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-29T04:33:17Z","updated_at":"2024-09-03T19:54:56Z","closed_at":"2024-09-03T19:54:56Z","merged_at":"2024-09-03T19:54:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"7b238a9e372c44efc16795619aeade423768cfd2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2894/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2894/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2894/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/c0e7084a679e80ceabfa39e21415aa43096bd6b0","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:n+1-same-mz-drop","ref":"n+1-same-mz-drop","sha":"c0e7084a679e80ceabfa39e21415aa43096bd6b0","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2821 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis pull request (PR) implements changes to the Helix Gateway service, focusing on improving the state transition handling and event processing that aligns to Helix long term goal - retire the concept of message and communicate only target state with helix participant. \r\n\r\nThe main modifications include:\r\nUpdating the protobuf definitions in HelixGatewayService.proto. Removing transition ID for both inbound and outbound message.\r\n\r\nModifying the HelixGatewayServiceChannel interface and its implementations to remove the currentState parameter from the sendStateTransitionMessage method.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nThe TestHelixGatewayParticipant class has been updated to reflect the changes in the HelixGatewayParticipant class. Specifically:\r\n\r\nThe processPendingMessage method now includes a toState parameter and updates the state transition completion logic.\r\nThe mock HelixGatewayServiceChannel implementation has been updated to match the new interface.\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-27T06:35:26Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T16:35:42Z","closed_at":"2024-08-28T16:35:42Z","merged_at":"2024-08-28T16:35:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"69e69ec11776135a8fa100c2659f522effd880bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2892/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2892/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2892/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/a58e89586cec3d8858461a7df03849934f193f74","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:gatewayservice-4","ref":"gatewayservice-4","sha":"a58e89586cec3d8858461a7df03849934f193f74","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation to allow gateway participant to only send transitions to the targetState to the client application.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe intended behavior for HelixGateway is to only send the targetState to the client application. A major refactor of Helix internals will be required to achieve this, as the controller will send a state transition message for each state in the state machine instead of just the final target state.\r\n\r\nUntil that refactor, the gateway participant will consult the IdealState of the resource for the pending state transition and forward a shard assignment message that has a the to state from the IdealState instead. All following ST messages from the controller will be auto-completed and NOT forwarded to the participant, as the client is already in the target state.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] TestHelixGatewayParticipant.testOnlySendTargetState\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nresolves #2822\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nOne of the key steps of sticky rebalance strategy is to populate the previous node usage based on current mapping. Previous we do this in rebalance stage where we don't have the node usage info from global view. e.g. if the nodeA has resource1, then in rebalance stage of resource2, we don't have this info anymore. This PR moves the existing assignments usage calculation to pre-process stage where we will have the global view for all resources.\r\n\r\nWill add one more test in following PR when https://github.com/apache/helix/pull/2889 is merged from master to this feature branch.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n`helix-core/src/test/java/org/apache/helix/integration/rebalancer/TestStickyRebalanceStrategy.java`\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn test -o -Dtest=TestStickyRebalanceStrategy -pl=helix-core\r\n...\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 9, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 61.9 s - in TestSuite\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 9, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/tmu/projects/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 961 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n...\r\nmvn test -o -Dtest=TestStickyRebalanceWithGlobalPerInstancePartitionLimit -pl=helix-core\r\n...\r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 19.285 s - in org.apache.helix.integration.rebalancer.TestStickyRebalanceWithGlobalPerInstancePartitionLimit\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] --- jacoco:0.8.6:report (generate-code-coverage-report) @ helix-core ---\r\n[INFO] Loading execution data file /Users/tmu/projects/helix/helix-core/target/jacoco.exec\r\n[INFO] Analyzed bundle 'Apache Helix :: Core' with 961 classes\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2885 \r\nHelix stoppable does not account for multiple replicas in the same fault zone. This can occur during instance operations such as swap but also as a result of the issue linked above. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the batch stoppable check parallelizes the performHelixOwnInstanceCheck, which includes the min active replica check. This parallelization works on the assumption that a single partition will not have more than 2 replicas hosted in 1 fault zone. This assumption is not fully correct as n+1 transitions can result in 2 replicas in the same fault zone, as well instance operations such as SWAP. \r\n\r\nThe parallelization of the other helix health checks can be kept to not lose out on that optimization. The min active check can then be done sequentially for each instance. \r\n\r\nThere is a potential for optimizing the min active replica check. Currently it is done per instance and reads the externalView and idealStates for each resource from ZK. It could be optimized to read the EVs and IS's once and use those for all instances the check is being ran on. However, I did not want to complicate this first draft of the PR with that refactoring. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nTestInstancesAccessor.java#testMultipleReplicasInSameMZ\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ mvn test -o -Dtest=TestPerInstanceAccessor,TestInstancesAccessor,TestMaintenanceManagementService -pl=helix-rest\r\n\r\n[INFO] Results:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Tests run: 45, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[INFO] Total time:  02:31 min\r\n[INFO] Finished at: 2024-08-15T20:43:09-07:00\r\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nNot a significant incompatibility, but the STOPPABLE_CHECK_LIST no longer contains the min_active_replica check as it is done separately. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-16T03:45:05Z","updated_at":"2024-08-28T21:27:35Z","closed_at":"2024-08-28T21:27:35Z","merged_at":"2024-08-28T21:27:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"aaf2294c884edc71f7eb815c774c6a9fad835856","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2886/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2886/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2886/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/36053c4b643f828c3d152f7260d6dcab41f99d41","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:stoppable-same-mz-fix","ref":"stoppable-same-mz-fix","sha":"36053c4b643f828c3d152f7260d6dcab41f99d41","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\n#2821 \r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new configuration system for the Helix Gateway service, allowing for more flexible and customizable channel configurations. The main changes include:\r\n1. Introduction of `GatewayServiceChannelConfig` class to manage various channel configurations.\r\n2. Implementation of a factory pattern (`HelixGatewayServiceChannelFactory`) for creating appropriate service channels based on the configuration.\r\nThe PR also includes various improvements in error handling, logging, and code organization.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\n- `GatewayServiceChannelConfigTest`: Tests the new `GatewayServiceChannelConfig` class and its builder.\r\n- `TestGatewayServiceConnection`: Updated to use the new configuration system.\r\n- `TestGatewayServiceManager`: Modified to work with the new channel configuration.\r\n\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\n(Consider including all behavior changes for public methods or API. Also include these changes in merge description so that other developers are aware of these changes. This allows them to make relevant code changes in feature branches accounting for the new method/API behavior.)\r\n\r\n### Documentation (Optional)\r\n\r\n- In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation in the following wiki page:\r\n\r\n(Link the GitHub wiki you added)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-09T22:38:38Z","updated_at":"2024-08-23T06:14:10Z","closed_at":"2024-08-23T06:14:10Z","merged_at":"2024-08-23T06:14:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"dad8c8cd24a0129081581a370dc6f6ece78a4ba2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2716944451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE2OTQ0NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/labels/CheckedAndApproved","name":"CheckedAndApproved","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2883/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2883/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2883/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/1dea4b272cd8f4caeec20a7328a2b67ab4743bd0","head":{"label":"xyuanlu:gatewayservice-2","ref":"gatewayservice-2","sha":"1dea4b272cd8f4caeec20a7328a2b67ab4743bd0","user":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":260321741,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjAzMjE3NDE=","name":"helix","full_name":"xyuanlu/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xyuanlu","id":6392021,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTIwMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6392021?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu","html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xyuanlu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xyuanlu/helix","description":"Mirror

getAllInstances. getAllInstances \"instances\" value is built from the instance configs in the cluster. \r\ntestInstancesAccessor and testPerInstanceAccessor both modify the same cluster - `TestCluster_4`\r\nupdateInstance in testPerInstanceAccessor adds an instance config but does not remove it. This may lead to the failure in testGetAllInstances because the cluster has an instance config added but the in memory map of _instancesMap does not have an instance added as well\r\n\r\nLooking at the logs of previously failed runs vs successful runs.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2872\r\nWhen a write occurs, ZkBucketDataAccessor schedules a GC task to execute 60s (default ttl) from when the task was submitted. If there already exists a GC task, [updateGCTimer](https://github.com/apache/helix/blob/2add0c48e648c011740ec419a1b1ef17a5888c97/helix-core/src/main/java/org/apache/helix/manager/zk/ZkBucketDataAccessor.java#L357) attempts to cancel it reschedule it for 60s from then.\r\n\r\nWith this current logic, if the time between subsequent writes is never slower than the ttl (60s), then a GC task will never be executed - the task will constantly be scheduled and then cancelled.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nZkBucket GC's are no longer rescheduled if another write occurs. \r\ndeleteStaleVersions has been refactored to determine recent version at method execution time (rather than passing currentVersion as a parameter)\r\nThis should guarantee that a GC will occur within TTL delay (60) seconds from any write. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestGCScheduler\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2818\r\ntestDisableErrorLogByDefault in TestStatusUpdateUtil failing intermittently\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThere are 2 things at play here:\r\n1. TestParticipantManager's static field is setting STATEUPDATEUTIL_ERROR_PERSISTENCY_ENABLED to true. My assumption is that this code is executed early on when the JVM firsts loads these classes. This is why StatusUpdateUtil is pushing error logs to ZK in the first place\r\n2. Setting the static field's variable appears to not successfully propagate the changed value to the loaded class. This is why the logs are pushed to ZK despite using setFinalStatic to change the value to false. At this point I'm not sure why it fails - my very uneducated guess is that the jvm might be doing some optimization by having threads cache the variables and the change is not propagated properly. The observed behavior is that when reading the value of  StatusUpdateUtil.ERROR_LOG_TO_ZK_ENABLED within TestStatusUpdateUtil will show false (set by setFinalStatic call), but the value when read within StatusUpdateUtil's publishErrorRecord will show true (original value). \r\n\r\nI'm not sure this specific approach of having a static method to reassign the static variable is the best practice. Maybe it is better to modify StatusUpdateUtil so that it has a local variable taht can be set by its constructor, or that defaults to the system property value if no value provided. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestDisableErrorLogByDefault\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally. Then copy & paste the result of \"mvn test\" to here.)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-02T21:46:24Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T18:26:02Z","closed_at":"2024-08-06T18:26:01Z","merged_at":"2024-08-06T18:26:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb29cece3b78a4f0283f44e3b3362837c0c6eaa7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/cc17e5068369488c2b3384d159aaa8e4e443c955","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:disable-error-log","ref":"disable-error-log","sha":"cc17e5068369488c2b3384d159aaa8e4e443c955","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\nWhile the SwapIn operation is in progress, the swapIn node does not consider the disabled partitions on the swapIn node. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nselectSwapInState now considers whether the swapIn node has any disabled resources. This is done by passing the ResourceControllerDataProvider cache to the method to determine if the partition is disabled on the node. If the partition is disabled, then the intended state will be OFFLINE, this can lead to 2 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. If the swapIn node's partition is disabled PRIOR to it being assigned the partition as part of the swap operation, then it will not be assigned the partition until the partition is reenabled. This is because the IS says offline, and we do not send state transition DROPPED --> OFFLINE. \r\n2. If the swapIn node's partition is disabled AFTER being assigned the partition as part of the swap operation, then it will downward transit those partitions to the OFFLINE state. \r\nIn both of these cases, the swap operation cannot complete while partitions are disabled because it does not have the intended state of the swapOut node. In both of these cases, re-enabling the partitions will then cause the swap operation to proceed as normal. \r\n\r\nThis PR also includes some minor changes to other tests within the same integrration test file to address potential flakiness and further isolate each test method.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\ntestDisabledPartitionsBeforeSwapInitiated\r\ntestDisabledPartitionsAfterSwapInitiated\r\n\r\n- The following is the result of the \"mvn test\" command on the appropriate module:\r\n\r\n(If CI test fails due to known issue, please specify the issue and test PR locally.

Issues\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/helix/issues/2818\r\nFlaky test currently failing in CI\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTest failing in CI but passes locally. Likely this is due to attempting to read ZK node immediately after calling calling .logError() . If ZK server on CI is slow, the node may not be created yet. We should use verifier instead to retry read and only assert that it is eventually created\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n\r\nchanged to using verifier in: TestStatusUpdateUtil.testEnableErrorLog\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- My diff has been formatted using helix-style.xml \r\n(helix-style-intellij.xml if IntelliJ IDE is used)\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-28T01:48:38Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T05:48:56Z","closed_at":"2024-07-29T05:48:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"184e2105907afc7d2f3825015c0bf5407e82de48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2854/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/2854/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/issues/2854/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/helix/statuses/870297abf6bd9c39b3c946eb081cc35a6e1d8860","head":{"label":"GrantPSpencer:fix-test-testDisableErrorLogByDefault","ref":"fix-test-testDisableErrorLogByDefault","sha":"870297abf6bd9c39b3c946eb081cc35a6e1d8860","user":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":645914891,"node_id":"R_kgDOJn_hCw","name":"helix","full_name":"GrantPSpencer/helix","private":false,"owner":{"login":"GrantPSpencer","id":80296166,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjk2MTY2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80296166?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer","html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GrantPSpencer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/GrantPSpencer/helix","description":"Fork

Issues\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following Helix issues and references them in the PR description:\r\n\r\nWith the recent changes to InstanceOperation, Helix allows users to set their instances to DISABLE where all partitions are gracefully transited to the offline state. Likewise, customers can also disable specific partitions to transit them to offline (CRUSHED) or move them off the node (WAGED). However, because there can only be 1 active InstanceOperation on a node at a time, a user cannot DISABLE an evacuating or SWAP_IN instance without overriding that operation. There are scenarios where a user may want to ensure that the instance being operated on immediately downward state transits its partitions or does not receive any upward state transitions while it is being operated on. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis change adds support for the ALL_RESOURCES key in the disabled partitions map of an instance's config. This change mirrors the current behavior of disabling a specific partition on a node, but extends that to all partitions in the cluster. \r\n\r\nThe main area this change effects are:\r\nWAGED placement calculation - AssignableNode and ReplicaActivateConstraint\r\nDelayedAutoRebalancer - computeBestPossiblePartitionState (responsible for forcing partitions down to offline)\r\n\r\nThere will likely need to be discussion had on how to best reduce complexity of adding the \"ALL_RESOURCES\" key. Future code may need to explicitly check for this key depending on what methods they are leveraging. which will likely not be obvious for developers\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] The following tests are written for this issue:\r\n**Basic Functionality**\r\ntestDisableAllPartitions in TestDisablePartitions.java\r\n\r\n**Test Asserting Behavior Alongside Instance Operation**\r\ntestEvacuateWithDisabledPartition in TestInstanceOperation.java\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes that Break Backward Compatibility (Optional)\r\n\r\n- My PR contains changes that break backward compatibility or previous assumptions for certain methods or API. They include:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- My commits all reference appropriate Apache Helix GitHub issues in their subject lines. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.
