appears that Go 1.10 stopped working for the precommits but both Go 1.11 and Go 1.12 work. Given that Go 1.13 is releasing soon we should at least get to the current version (go 1.12) \r\n* Update a few latent tasks to use the GoGradle Tasks\r\n* Update GoGradle to 0.11.4\r\n* Update GoGradle to use Go 1.12\r\n\r\nGoGradle apparently sources the Go tool of the correct version itself, so there shouldn't be any jenkins image changes required. AFAICT Moving to a new version of the GoGradle plugin simply uses gradle magic.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a python developer I'd like to have a more opinionated API for implementing external transforms so that A) it can guide me toward more standardized solutions and B) reduce the amount of boilerplate code that I need to write. \r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\n- Create a constant for the expansion service address, to avoid copying it into the `__init__` args of every external transform\r\n- Move the urn to the class-level to enforce consistency (which enables us to reduce boilerplate) and also for the sake of correctness: the value does not vary per instance\r\n- Reduce boilerplate:\r\n  - Provide a helper to create a `ConfigValue` with encoded value\r\n    - Automatically determine the list of coder urns from a compound coder\r\n    - Handle utf-8 encoding, if requested\r\n  - Create the `ExternalTransform` for the user based on the configuration dictionary that they provide\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

change achieves the following:\r\n\r\n* Creates a clearer name for the integration test:\r\n  BigQueryIOStorageReadCorrectnessIT\r\n\r\n* Removes the small tables from the tests. The tables removed do not exist in\r\n  all test projects, making it difficult to have this test execute as part of\r\n  existing suites that are automatic.\r\n\r\n* Adds the test to googleCloudPlatformLegacyWorkerIntegrationTest, so it is\r\n  executed more regularly.\r\n\r\n* Uses a larger table. Small tables don't give good correctness signals that the\r\n  Storage API is doing the right thing.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR does a few things towards adding State Backed Iterables\r\n* Adds unit tests for the existing iterable protocols.\r\n* Refactors the two disparate read loops in datasource.go into a single loop, and introduces helper methods to clean up repeated code.\r\n  * This further helps prepare for [BEAM-490] where CoGBK becomes first class.\r\n*   Renames code that is fairly State API centric to to State from SideInput. \r\n  * Most of the code was to help use the StateAPI for Side inputs, but it was really rather general.\r\n  * Note: This only helps with Reading, and in particular Runner iterables from the state API, not doing anything towards Writing.\r\n* Actually implement the State backed protocol (with unit test)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your

 jump to the latest conversation here: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9056#issuecomment-546732744\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nThis is an early look at type annotations for the beam source.  It is _not_ attempting to address the issue of porting beam runtime typing from its own internal typehints module to the official tying module, so perhaps I should open a new ticket just for type hinting the source.\r\n\r\nEDIT: done.  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-7746\r\n\r\nThere's a lot left to do, including getting this hooked up to tests, but I wanted to get it out there so that A) I can get feedback before I get too far along, and B) in case anyone wants to join forces with me.\r\n\r\nSome points for discussion / debate:\r\n\r\n## type annotation style\r\n\r\nIn python 2.7, we're limited to type comments, and it can be quite difficult to keep them under the 80 character limit, since they're not very flexible. I'm following the lead of typing-heavy projects like mypy and using the following style for functions with more than one or two arguments:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n  def __init__(self,\r\n               evaluation_context, # type: EvaluationContext\r\n               applied_ptransform,  # type: AppliedPTransform\r\n               input_committed_bundle,\r\n               side_inputs\r\n               ):\r\n    # type: (...) -> None\r\n```\r\n\r\n## typing module import\r\n\r\nSome projects establish a convention to import only the typing objects required for the current module, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom typing import Iterable, Tuple\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince beam has its own internal `typehints` module I'm importing the `typing` module in the same fashion to avoid conflicts/confusion.  However, this approach has the downside of making some type comments a lot longer and less legible, e.g. `typing.Union[typing.Iterable[str], str]`, which may make it impossible to stay below 80 characters in some cases.\r\n\r\n## type checking pipeline construction\r\n\r\nThe type hints are useful first-and-foremost for developers of beam, but they should also prove useful for consumers of the beam API, i.e. developers of beam pipelines.   Though it's a secondary concern at the moment, I'm trying to ensure that the use case of pipeline creation is covered, so that mypy will generate proper errors for invalid combinations of transforms prior to submission, but due to a [bug/weakness](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/6933) this is harder than expected.  I'm making progress writing a mypy plugin to patch up the problem, but it's not done yet.  Using the results of this process for runtime typing (e.g. to lookup coders) is out of scope for this PR.\r\n\r\n## str vs unicode\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm glossing over this problem.  The _correct_ way to annotate strings for both python 2 and 3 is to use `typing.Text` and `typing.AnyStr`, but it's a huge pain in the ass, in particular because it's often unclear where unicode is valid or invalid (I've also run into inaccuracies in the python typeshed wrt strings).  In my own projects, I just annotate everything as `str` and handle the few cases where mypy complains about `unicode` by using `typing.cast(str, whatever)`, since the problem will get a lot simpler when we switch to python3, and `bytes` becomes the exception.  I'm open to suggestions here. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'll probably think of more later, but I'm out of time and want to get this out the door!\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
