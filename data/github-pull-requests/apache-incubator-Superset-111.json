SUMMARY\r\nWe can rearrange metrics and filters labels with drag&drop functionality.\r\n\r\nWe use very old version of react-dnd (2.5.4) - it might be worth to consider an upgrade. I had to disable some lint and ts errors - e.g. due to type definitions for typescript.\r\nreact-dnd v2.5.4 has a bug that prevents using refs in functional components - for that reason I had to use `findDOMNode`, which should be replaced as soon as we do the upgrade.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR add some functionality to Native Filters Modal config:\r\n\r\n1. Sync scoping tree in Native filters config modal:\r\n - Save selected scopes to redux\r\n - Get selected scopes from redux and populate them to the tree\r\n - Correct processing scoping per selected filter on left side of modal\r\n - Fixed Filters Scope in Native Filters form\r\n - Done some general refactoring in Scope tree\r\n\r\n‚òùÔ∏è Scoping tree clone logic of old scope tree that worked with `FilterBox` filters. This tree save data in redux `nativeFilters` domain and in future this data will be used to filter specific charts\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nHere example of redux/ui

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the V1 chart data API expects all fields on the `QueryObject` to be explicitly defined - any unexpected fields will raise an exception. This changes the default behavior to exclude unknown fields, thus making the backend more resilient to requests including redundant metadata. Needed for #10288\r\n\r\nRelevant Marshmallow docs: https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html#handling-unknown-fields\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nCI + added test that would have failed

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhile testing dashboard import I found a small bug in the export. In the export we rename the columns `position_json` to `position` (since we load the JSON) and `json_metadata` to `metadata` (same). If the values were empty we were not renaming them, causing a schema validation error on import.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAfter recent upgrades of Redux (#11967 ), FilterBox selects would lose focus once users focused on it, making it impossible to type to search filter values. This is caused by some unnecessary rendering. Fixed by moving FilterBox component to `React.PureComponent`. Didn't dig deep, but my guess is this is because new Redux now will re-render components even if props are all the same.\r\n\r\nFixes #12107. \r\n\r\nThis should have been caught by the FilterBox test case had it been enabled. Maybe previously it was flaky because of the same reason. Let's see if re-enable it gives us any luck this time.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\n<!--- What steps should be taken to verify the changes

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nForces boolean values to render as a string instead of using the `react-table` Cell renderer.

anyone that needs a boolean column to repro this issue, here's a query you can run in SQL Lab and carry over to Explore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT gender, name , SUM(num) AS sum__num, \r\n  bool_or(gender = 'boy') over (partition by name) as is_boy\r\nFROM birth_names\r\nWHERE ds >= '1920-08-22 00:00:00.000000'\r\n  AND ds <= '2020-08-22 02:23:48.000000'\r\nGROUP BY gender, name\r\nORDER BY sum__num

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFixes a few issues with alerts:\r\n- Add button is disabled for both the alerts and reports modal when all required fields are filled\r\n- The \"Add Report\" modal field has label and helper text \"Add Alert\" and section header \"Alert Condition Schedule\". Let's change these to \"Add Report\" and \"Report Schedule\"\r\n- Switch over select apis to use `/api/v1/related/<chart|dashboard|database|owners>`\r\n- expose `api/v1/report/related/created_by` api\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"838\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-12-17 at 10 10 44 PM\"

manual test:\r\n  - Modal submit button is enabled after all required fields have been filled\r\n  - Report modal has copy updated `alert -> report`\r\n  - select values are fetched from `/api/v1/report/related/*` endpoints.\r\n  \r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nWhen fetching cached data from the new `/api/v1/chart/data` endpoint in the async query lifecycle, the `force` param from the initial request was propagated to the cached data load, causing an error when force-reloading a chart's data. This PR removes the `force` param from the cached `QueryContext` data.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nEnable the `GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES` feature flag and test force-reloading a chart using the new chart data API.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCI has been slow recently. This PR is the latest effort in trying to mitigate:\r\n\r\n1. Update the Cancel Previous Run job added in #11940 to cancel future jobs as well.\r\n2. Skip dependabot branches when possible (e.g. don't run Python jobs for npm updates).\r\n3. Merge lighter actions (Prefer Typescript and License Check) into one workflow (there are overheads in starting a job).\r\n4. Add a script to allow committers to manually cancel CI jobs in queue. This is useful on a busy day when the CI pipeline got clogged by continuous new commits to open PRs. Users have to configure [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in their env variables in order to use this.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   (superset) ‚ûú  incubator-superset git:(manage-github-workflow) ‚úó ./scripts/cancel_github_workflows.py --help \r\n   Usage: cancel_github_workflows.py [OPTIONS] BRANCH_OR_PULL\r\n \r\n     Cancel running or queued GitHub workflows by

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCI has been slow recently. This PR is the latest effort in trying to mitigate:\r\n\r\n1. Update the Cancel Previous Run job added in #11940 to cancel future jobs as well.\r\n2. Skip dependabot branches when possible (e.g. don't run Python jobs for npm updates).\r\n3. Merge lighter actions (Prefer Typescript and License Check) into one workflow.\r\n4. Add a script to allow committers to manually cancel CI jobs in queue. This is useful on a busy day when the CI pipeline got clogged by continuous new commits to open PRs. Users have to configure [`GITHUB_TOKEN`](https://github.com/settings/tokens) in their env variables in order to use this.\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   (superset) ‚ûú  incubator-superset

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a few small fixes to the import/export feature:\r\n\r\n1. Micro optimizations: some JSON fields may be empty strings, so we only serialize/deserialize them if they have an actual document.\r\n2. Fixes: I was checking for the wrong exception when dumping JSON to a string (copy-and-paste mistakes, sigh).\r\n3. Deserialize more fields: some of the fields that had a JSON payload were not being deserialized when exporting to YAML.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fix all [exhaustive-deps](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14920) lint warnings. With this PR and also #12010 we'll have a code base with no lint warnings. \r\n\r\nThe most part of this PR changes useEffect dependencies so it's critical that we do a lot of testing because if one dependency keeps changing the interface will keep rendering. We have some functions as dependencies and we need to make sure that they don‚Äôt change if not needed using techniques like useCallback.\r\n\r\nI already did a lot of testing but since I don't know all the functionalities yet we need more developers involved in the review process.\r\n\r\n### TEST PLAN\r\nAssuming that the automatic tests already covered the majority of use cases, the basic idea here would be to review the code and test the affected modules simulating different user interactions.\r\n\r\n@rusackas As soon as you merge #12010 I can update this PR with the latest changes.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Requires DB Migration.\r\n- [ ] Confirm DB Migration upgrade and downgrade tested.\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes SQL Lab discriminate errors that happen because of missing parameters in the query, showing them as \"Parameter Error\" instead of \"Database Error\".\r\n\r\nThe error component in SQL Lab seems to be outdated, but I didn't want to change it now since we would like to include this fix before 1.0. Since I'm using [SIP-40](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/issues/9194) for the error in the backend, hopefully we can migrate SQL Lab to use something like `<DatabaseErrorMessage />` and it will Just Work‚Ñ¢.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_2020-12-14
