Description\r\nThis PR removes an overly restrictive validation check on `ARRAY_AGG` which was preventing use with druid `COMPLEX` types, such as `COMPLEX<json>`. This check is a relic from when this function was added, which was before the native expression system supported `COMPLEX` types.\r\n\r\nAfter removing this check, I ran into a couple of rough edges, and a bug in `ObjectStrategyComplexTypeStrategy`, which was missing a check to ensure that the positional `read` method actually moved the buffer position forward by the number of bytes read (useful for array_agg which is serializing arrays) instead of relying on the underlying `ObjectStrategy` to move the buffer.\r\n\r\nAfter the bugs, the result seems pretty useful, particularly for `COMPLEX<json>` (though certainly not the speediest thing around since its implemented as an expression aggregator):\r\n<img width=\"1239\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-02-09 at 3 06 39 AM\"

`ARRAY_OFFSET` and `ARRAY_ORDINAL` functions, as well as made native `ARRAY` typed expressions more consistently honor `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when filtering on a `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` that is using an input column that is not a nested column, such as a standard string, long, float, or double column. #13732 updated `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` to be permissive and still able to create selectors when used with other column types, but I forgot to add this handling to the `getIndexSupplier` method, so attempting to filter these columns with a filter which would typically use an index, would result in an exception being thrown about the column being the wrong type, something like \r\n\r\n```\r\nColumn [__time] is invalid type, found [class org.apache.druid.segment.column.LongsColumn] instead of [NestedDataComplexColumn]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this method to use the same logic as the selector methods, returning the underlying columns index supplier directly if selecting the 'root' path, else null as if the column didn't exist.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x]

PR is a collection if minor edits done as part of the Catalog project. Pulled out here to reduce the size of the catalog PR.\r\n\r\nThe edits include:\r\n\r\n* Fix spacing\r\n* Add type parameters to some types that omit them (to prevent the IDE from flagging spurious warnings)\r\n* Add `toString()` methods to formats so tests compare correctly. Without this, an UT with an external data source will fail if the two formats are not the same object. The change allows comparison as long as the two formats have identical values.\r\n* IT doc revisions\r\n* Error message edits\r\n* Display UT query results when tests fail. This makes it easy to copy/paste the correct results into the test.\r\n* When creating alert records, omit the `query` field if it is `null`. (Else, the original error is masked by an NPE in the logging code.)\r\n\r\nNo substantial changes are in the PR.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nNo user-visible changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR

has an `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to provide metadata about Druid tables and columns. Historically, columns that contain numbers (such as `ORDINAL_POSITION`) were represented as `VARCHAR`. This seems to be due to an implementation limitation. Some numeric columns (such as `NUMERIC_PRECISION`) are valid only some of the time, and require SQL `NULL` values other times. The schema of the information schema columns was describe using Druid types, and Druid does not seem to provide a nullable `BIGINT` column. Thus, the only way to set `NUMERIC_PRECISION` to `NULL` is to define it as a Druid `string`.)\r\n\r\nWhile this works, it has the unfortunate result of sorting incorrectly. Consider the following query:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT ORDINAL_POSITION, COLUMN_NAME\r\nFROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS\r\nWHERE TABLE_NAME = 'foo'\r\nORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the table has more than ten columns, the ordering  of the ordinals is 1, 11, 12, 2, ... because \"11\" sorts as a string before \"2\". Needless to say, this is quite surprising. It makes it hard for a client to obtain columns in ordinal order. (The workaround is to _not_ sort since the columns are produced in the correct order, but this is a somewhat silly workaround.)\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use SQL types, not Druid types, to declare the table schema. After all, the information schema tables are processed by the Linq4j engine, which understands SQL types. We had to (incorrectly) translate the Druid types to SQL.\r\n\r\nAfter making this change, the ordinals do, in fact, sort in numeric order.\r\n\r\nIn testing this change, I noticed that Druid numbers columns counting from 0. However, SQL prefers counting from 1. So, this change also modifies the column ordinals to start with 1.\r\n\r\nUpdated the documentation to use SQL types (not Druid types) in the description of the system tables. These tables can only be accessed via SQL and thus only the SQL types are relevant.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nThe affect of this change is to make the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables more SQL-like. If a client was depending on numeric fields being strings, then that client may produce unexpected results. Similarly, if a client was expecting columns to be numbered from 0, then the new 1-based numbering may impact the client. Otherwise, clients will find that queries against `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` tables act more like a user would expect: more like they act in other databases.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X]

commit borrows some test definitions from Drill's test suite and tries to use them to flesh out the full validation of window function capbilities.\r\n\r\nIn order to be able to run these tests, we also add the ability to run a Scan operation against segments, which also meant an implementation of RowsAndColumns for frames.\r\n\r\nInitially, in trying to add these tests, I also started trying to\r\nfix the problems that arose.  One of which was being able to scan\r\ndata from segments for use in queries.  This is necessary for these\r\ntests because the Drill tests are generally not grouping on things\r\nfirst and, instead, are essentially just resolving to scan operators.\r\n\r\nAfter resolving that issue, I ran into another set of bugs specifically\r\nassociated with Calcite query planning, where Calcite did not give me\r\na logical plan that mapped correctly to the semantics of the query.\r\nAs I dove into that, I realized that it was a bigger ball of yarn and\r\nthis commit was already starting to sprawl out in scope, so I changed\r\nstrategy and am instead introducing the test framework and fixes\r\nthat have been made so far, will introduce the full set of 2000\r\nfiles for the tests in a subsequent commit, and just focus this commit\r\non the code changes required to get everything in place.\r\n\r\nTable of Contents (or, what to expect when reviewing this):\r\n\r\n1. Changes in `parquet-extension`, these are some code changes to add a main (`ParquetToJson`) that can be used to convert parquet files to new-line delimited Json.  This is just to have a utility for developers to use if we ever need to add a new dataset that is defined by parquet and is not a Main intended for a general audience\r\n2. There is a change to the `FrameColumnReader` to have it be able to read out a RowsAndColumns column.  This hopefully also provides a relatively straight-forward path for using Frame columns in cases where direct reads from locations makes more sense than the `ColumnSelector`/`DimensionSelector` routes that have been previously employed\r\n3. There's a `DecoratableRowsAndColumn` semantic interface added that takes on \"decorations\" of a RAC and tries to lazily execute them.  This is leveraged in making the ability to read the segment work.  Note that the capabilities for reading segments have only the minimum implemented to make these tests run and are not implemented and wired up to be able to actually execute in a distributed environment.\r\n4. There are only a few test cases checked in inside of this PR because, when I initially tried to include all of them, the PR was 2600 files.  I didn't want the 2600 files to take away from the code that is deserving of review, so I decided to only check in a few of the files in this PR.  Once this is merged, I will do a new PR with all of the other files, which will essentially just be creating new files in the `resources` directory without any actual code changes.  That should make it easy to merge in the 2600 extra files for tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.","created_at":"2023-02-08T06:52:11Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T10:28:40Z","closed_at":"2023-07-06T16:20:33Z","merged_at":"2023-07-06T16:20:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"5fc122a144cbb9dcc3471e518872ef2d2a135504","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new config property `druid.sql.planner.operatorConversion.denyList`, which allows a user to specify\r\nany operator conversions that they wish to disallow. A user may want to do this for a number of reasons, including security concerns. The default value of this property is the empty list `[]`, which does not disallow any operator conversions.\r\n\r\nAn example usage of this property is `druid.sql.planner.operatorConversion.denyList=[\"extern\"]`, which disallows the usage of the `extern` operator conversion. If the property is configured this way, and a user of the Druid cluster tries to submit a query that uses the `extern` function, such as the example given [here](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/multi-stage-query/examples.html#insert-with-no-rollup), a response with http response code `400` is returned with en error body similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"taskId\": \"4ec5b0b6-fa9b-4c3a-827d-2308294e9985\",\r\n  \"state\": \"FAILED\",\r\n  \"error\": {\r\n    \"error\": \"Plan validation failed\",\r\n    \"errorMessage\": \"org.apache.calcite.runtime.CalciteContextException: From line 28, column 5 to line 32, column 5: No match found for function signature EXTERN(<CHARACTER>, <CHARACTER>, <CHARACTER>)\",\r\n    \"errorClass\": \"org.apache.calcite.tools.ValidationException\",\r\n    \"host\": null\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths,

PR solves 2 things:\r\n\r\n1. When the first row of a MVD is null, the previous version of unnest was giving an incorrect result as the underlying object was not being updated. \r\n\r\nPrevious:\r\n```\r\nselect * from mytest1, unnest(mv_to_array(c2)) as unnested(c3)\r\n\r\n__time                    c1 c2            c3\r\n2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z  1  null          null\r\n2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z  2  [\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"] null\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this change\r\n```\r\nselect * from mytest1, unnest(mv_to_array(c2)) as unnested(c3)\r\n\r\n__time                    c1 c2            c3\r\n2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z  1  null          null\r\n2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z  2  [\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"] A\r\n2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z  2  [\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"] B\r\n2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z  2  [\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"] C\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. For nested queries that has an unnest in the inner as well as the outer query, the output column name was being always set to EXPR$0. This now changes that behavior to make output column names different.\r\n\r\nBefore for the query \r\n```\r\nwith t AS (select dim2, d3 from druid.numfoo, unnest(MV_TO_ARRAY(dim3)) as unnested (d3))\r\nselect d2,d3 from t, UNNEST(MV_TO_ARRAY(dim2)) as unnested(d2)\r\n```\r\nThe planner would do\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"queryType\" : \"scan\",\r\n  \"dataSource\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"unnest\",\r\n    \"base\" : {\r\n      \"type\" : \"query\",\r\n      \"query\" : {\r\n        \"queryType\" : \"scan\",\r\n        \"dataSource\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"unnest\",\r\n          \"base\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"table\",\r\n            \"name\" : \"numfoo\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"column\" : \"dim3\",\r\n          \"outputName\" : \"EXPR$0\",\r\n          \"allowList\" : null\r\n        },\r\n        \"intervals\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"intervals\",\r\n          \"intervals\" : [ \"-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z/146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z\" ]\r\n        },\r\n        \"resultFormat\" : \"compactedList\",\r\n        \"columns\" : [ \"EXPR$0\", \"__time\", \"cnt\", \"d1\", \"d2\", \"dim1\", \"dim2\", \"dim3\", \"dim4\", \"dim5\", \"dim6\", \"f1\", \"f2\", \"l1\", \"l2\", \"m1\", \"m2\", \"unique_dim1\" ],\r\n        \"legacy\" : false,\r\n        \"context\" : {\r\n          \"defaultTimeout\" : 300000,\r\n          \"maxScatterGatherBytes\" : 9223372036854775807,\r\n          \"sqlCurrentTimestamp\" : \"2000-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\r\n          \"sqlQueryId\" : \"dummy\",\r\n          \"vectorize\" : \"false\",\r\n          \"vectorizeVirtualColumns\" : \"false\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"granularity\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"all\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"column\" : \"dim2\",\r\n    \"outputName\" : \"EXPR$0\",\r\n    \"allowList\" : null\r\n  },\r\n  \"intervals\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"intervals\",\r\n    \"intervals\" : [ \"-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z/146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z\" ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"resultFormat\" : \"compactedList\",\r\n  \"columns\" : [ \"EXPR$0\", \"EXPR$00\" ],\r\n  \"legacy\" : false,\r\n  \"context\" : {\r\n    \"defaultTimeout\" : 300000,\r\n    \"maxScatterGatherBytes\" : 9223372036854775807,\r\n    \"sqlCurrentTimestamp\" : \"2000-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\r\n    \"sqlQueryId\" : \"dummy\",\r\n    \"vectorize\" : \"false\",\r\n    \"vectorizeVirtualColumns\" : \"false\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"granularity\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"all\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter this change the planner plans correctly as \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"queryType\" : \"scan\",\r\n  \"dataSource\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"unnest\",\r\n    \"base\" : {\r\n      \"type\" : \"query\",\r\n      \"query\" : {\r\n        \"queryType\" : \"scan\",\r\n        \"dataSource\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"unnest\",\r\n          \"base\" : {\r\n            \"type\" : \"table\",\r\n            \"name\" : \"numfoo\"\r\n          },\r\n          \"column\" : \"dim3\",\r\n          \"outputName\" : \"EXPR$0\",\r\n          \"allowList\" : null\r\n        },\r\n        \"intervals\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"intervals\",\r\n          \"intervals\" : [ \"-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z/146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z\" ]\r\n        },\r\n        \"resultFormat\" : \"compactedList\",\r\n        \"columns\" : [ \"EXPR$0\", \"__time\", \"cnt\", \"d1\", \"d2\", \"dim1\", \"dim2\", \"dim3\", \"dim4\", \"dim5\", \"dim6\", \"f1\", \"f2\", \"l1\", \"l2\", \"m1\", \"m2\", \"unique_dim1\" ],\r\n        \"legacy\" : false,\r\n        \"context\" : {\r\n          \"defaultTimeout\" : 300000,\r\n          \"maxScatterGatherBytes\" : 9223372036854775807,\r\n          \"sqlCurrentTimestamp\" : \"2000-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\r\n          \"sqlQueryId\" : \"dummy\",\r\n          \"vectorize\" : \"false\",\r\n          \"vectorizeVirtualColumns\" : \"false\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"granularity\" : {\r\n          \"type\" : \"all\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    \"column\" : \"dim4\",\r\n    \"outputName\" : \"EXPR$00\",\r\n    \"allowList\" : null\r\n  },\r\n  \"intervals\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"intervals\",\r\n    \"intervals\" : [ \"-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z/146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z\" ]\r\n  },\r\n  \"resultFormat\" : \"compactedList\",\r\n  \"columns\" : [ \"EXPR$0\", \"EXPR$00\" ],\r\n  \"legacy\" : false,\r\n  \"context\" : {\r\n    \"defaultTimeout\" : 300000,\r\n    \"maxScatterGatherBytes\" : 9223372036854775807,\r\n    \"sqlCurrentTimestamp\" : \"2000-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\r\n    \"sqlQueryId\" : \"dummy\",\r\n    \"vectorize\" : \"false\",\r\n    \"vectorizeVirtualColumns\" : \"false\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"granularity\" : {\r\n    \"type\" : \"all\"\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally unit test cases for 1 and 2 have been added by creating a new data source in the CalciteTests framework\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   -

recommend setting the default for 'finalize' to 'N/A'.  There are various query stages at which finalization is possible.  By default, some intermediate steps do or don't finalize, and end results are finalized.  Setting 'finalize' to either 'true' or 'false' changes the default behavior.  The changes from setting it to 'true' are generally behind the scenes, but can affect some queries, when there are intermediate stages that are not finalized by default.\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Description\r\n\r\nWhen submitting an ingestion spec, users may pass a map of metadata in the ingestion spec config that will be added to ingestion metrics.\r\n\r\nThis will make it possible for operators to tag metrics with other metadata that doesn't necessarily line up with the existing tags like taskId.\r\n\r\nDruid clusters that ingest these metrics can take advantage of the nested data columns feature to process this additional metadata.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nNew: You can now add additional metadata to the ingestion metrics emitted from the Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFor batch ingestion (native batch tasks and the Hadoop batch task), this PR adds a list of the time intervals ingested to the completion report.  This list represents the time interval of each segment created by the task, condensed into as few intervals as possible.  For example, if four segments were created at 'day' granularity for March 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th, the report's `ingestedIntervals` list would contain two intervals, `[\"2023-03-01T00:00:00Z/2023-03-04T00:00:00Z\", \"2023-03-05T00:00:00Z/2023-03-06T00:00:00Z\"]`. \r\n\r\n#### Uses\r\nHaving ingested intervals available in the task completion report will be useful for client applications that want to take some action based on the new data added to (or data changed in) the dataset.  This may include querying the new data for schema changes (columns added / removed, etc.), notifying users of new or changed data in the dataset, etc.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n#### Code changes\r\n\r\nFor IndexTask and the Hadoop task the changes here are fairly straightforward.  For parallel tasks, the code in `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask` gathers intervals ingested from subtasks and adds them to the report.  But this task was already a bit hairy, so I extracted it into a new class, `ParallelIndexStatsReporter` and implementation subclasses.  The implementation is created by a factory based on the configuration of the parallel task.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nFor batch ingestion (native batch tasks and the Hadoop batch task), the completion report now contains a condensed list of the time intervals ingested.\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ParallelIndexSupervisorTask`\r\n * `IndexTask`\r\n * `HadoopIndexTask`\r\n * `IngestionStatsAndErrorsTaskReportData`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nWith SuperSorter using the PartitionedOutputChannels for sorting, it might OOM on inputs of reasonable size because the channel consists of both the writable frame channel and the frame allocator, both of which are not required once the output channel has been written to.\r\nThis change adds a readOnly to the output channel which contains only the readable channel, due to which unnecessary memory references to the writable channel and the memory allocator are lost once the output channel has been written to, preventing the OOM.  \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nUse local paths to workflows rather than git references so that they will be in lockstep with commit\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n* Changed uses: to local paths\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue. Don't reference the issue in the title of this pull-request. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n* Changing the cache key to be the commit SHA not a hash of .pom files, as the commit may change but the poms won't necessarily\r\n* Adding explicit Maven m2 cache restore step to work with SHA\r\n* Moved CI build step below cache restores, as they will speed up build times a bit if there is a partial cache hit (based on testing)\r\n* Adding `fail-on-cache-miss` directive so that the tests will not attempt to run without a successful cache restore\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR. Remove the items which are not done or not relevant to the PR. None of the items from the checklist below are strictly necessary, but it would be very helpful if you at least self-review the PR. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\n* Add per-service serviceAccounts\r\n* Add RBAC per service\r\n* Fix historical commented config `druid_segmentCache_locations` to match PVC mount path. In it's current form it breaks the historical pod when uncommented due to lack of permissions to create directory.\r\n* Update README.md with new options\r\n* Add default annotation to historical service stateful set. Without any annotations the historical service breaks when `druid-kubernetes-extensions` is enabled.\r\n\r\n### ATTENTION\r\nThis PR should be merged after #13746  since it contains a helm chart version bump incremental to that one.\r\n\r\n#### Goal\r\nThe goal of this PR is to bring the apache/druid helm chart up to modern standards and fix some small issues. Enabling per-service serviceAccounts allows for finer grained RBAC which is in general a better security posture. Without this all services are forced to use the default serviceAccount which creates issues when needing to annotate service accounts for things like AWS iRSA as well as makes your only method of controlled permissions using a dedicated namespace.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nUpdate suggested segment-cache path, Allow for per-service serviceAccounts in druid helm chart and finer-grained RBAC, and add a default annotation to historical statefulset.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#13745 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\nIf a user deploying via the Apache Druid helm chart is while using `druid-kubernetes-extensions` then there is no need to set a zookeeper host however the helm chart will fail if the user does not. \r\n\r\nThis change will remove the requirement for setting a zookeeper host and adds a comment to the values file to help helm chart consumers understand.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\nAn alternative design could have been to look for the druid config settings required [in the documentation](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/extensions-core/kubernetes.html) and base the conditional off of those but since they can be set at a per-process or global config level I thought it better to keep it simple.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFixed: Helm chart no longer requires a ZooKeeper host be set for users using `druid-kubernetes-extensions`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nWith fault tolerance enabled in MSQ, not all the work orders might be populated if the worker is restarted.

MSQ jobs start failing with `Premature EOF` / `SDKException` errors when `faultTolerance` and `durableShuffleStorage` context params are enabled.\r\nAfter adding some logging, it was found that these exceptions are preceded by `ConnectionReset` exceptions which might happen from S3 server side incase we open an S3 request for very long time. Trying out a change where we first download the file on s3 to local disk and then read fixed the issue for the jobs - but the caveat was that multiple threads downloading the files concurrently might put pressure on disks.\r\nSo, the current change downloads the file chunk-by-chunk locally at runtime and then stitch the chunks together under a SequenceInputStream for upstream MSQ processing engine. Each chunk is currently of size 100MB and is downloaded eagerly to a local file. When that chunk is consumed, the local file is deleted and the next chunk is queue is processed.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

had been implemented using a pure pair-wise, \"make a union -> add 2 things to union -> get sketch\" algorithm.  This algorithm does 2 things that was CPU\r\n\r\n1) The Union object always builds an HLL_8 sketch regardless of the\r\n  target type.  This means that when the target type is not HLL_8, we\r\n  spent CPU cycles converting to HLL_8 and back over and over again\r\n2) By throwing away the Union object and converting back to the\r\n  HllSketch only to build another Union object, we do lots and lots\r\n  of copy+conversions of the HllSketch\r\n\r\nThis change introduces an HllSketchHolder object which can hold onto a Union object and delay conversion back into an HllSketch until it is actually needed.  This follows the same pattern as the SketchHolder object for theta sketches.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code

Description\r\nThis PR fixes a handful of semi-related issues, mostly to do with with nested columns, and some of them a result (or easier to encounter) after the introduction of the type 'mimic' behavior introduced in #13653.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* modified druid schema column type compution to special case `COMPLEX<json>` handling to choose `COMPLEX<json>` if any column in any segment is `COMPLEX<json>`\r\n* `NestedFieldVirtualColumn` can now work correctly on any type of column, returning either a column selector if a root path, or nil selector if not\r\n* fixed a random bug with `NilVectorSelector` when using a vector size larger than the default and `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false` would have the nulls vector set to all false instead of true\r\n* fixed an overly aggressive check in `ExprEval.ofType` when handling complex types which would try to treat any string as base64 without gracefully falling back if it was not in fact base64 encoded, along with special handling for `COMPLEX<json>`\r\n* added `ExpressionVectorSelectors.castValueSelectorToObject` and `ExpressionVectorSelectors.castObjectSelectorToNumeric` as convenience methods to cast vector selectors using cast expressions without the trouble of constructing an expression. the polymorphic nature of the non-vectorized engine (and significantly larger overhead of non-vectorized expression processing) made adding similar methods for non-vectorized selectors less attractive and so have not been added at this time\r\n* Handles missing cases in `ExprEval.bestEffortOf` (Integer[], int[], byte[] which is now converted to base64 string instead of 'unknown complex') and fixes a translation error (float[] was not casting values to double), and test coverage\r\n* modernize calcite sql tests to not use deprecated `Parser` to build indexes\r\n* more tests more better\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-01T05:17:06Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:04:01Z","closed_at":"2023-02-07T03:48:02Z","merged_at":"2023-02-07T03:48:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"2d3bee85457851aa96d4d0ed937a19d17113d83c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes infinite iteration during sync monitoring when httpRemote task runner is used.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

PR uses the CODEOWNERS file as a workaround for notifications since GitHub doesn't allow watching a directory within a repo. @techdocsmith and @vtlim are Druid committers focused exclusively on the documentation, so it makes sense for them to be notified on changes. It'll also help catch PRs that need the `Area - Documentation` label applied and doc reviews.\r\n\r\nThis does not change the repo settings to require a review from code owners, so there's no change to any review requirements for PRs.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nUpgrade ZK from 3.5.9 to 3.5.10 to avoid data inconsistency risk:\r\n\r\n> If the leader crashes after sending a SNAP sync to a learner, but before sending the NEWLEADER message, the learner will not save the snapshot to disk. But it will advance its lastProcessedZxid to that from the snapshot (call it Zxid X)\r\n\r\n> A new leader will get elected, and it will resync our learner again immediately. But this time, it will use the incremental DIFF method, starting from Zxid X. A DIFF-based resync does not trigger snapshots, so the learner is still holding the original snapshot purely in memory. If the learner restarts after that, it will silently lose all the data up to Zxid X.\r\n\r\nMore details please refer to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-3642 and https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.5.10/releasenotes.html\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes an issue with nested columns that can occur when both actual `null` and the string `\"null\"` are present in any nested path that results in the `null` values incorrectly becoming associated with the `\"null\"` values.\r\n\r\nThe bug was caused by a usage of `String.valueOf` in `StringFieldColumnWriter` that was not checking for null values when writing out the column. This still worked by dumb luck because the fastutils 2Int maps that were backing the globalId lookup when writing out segments had a default value of 0, which happens to be `null` global id, so even though `\"null\"` wasn't present in the global dictionary it ended up with the correct id. However, if `\"null\"` was present, `null` would incorrectly be written out as the `\"null\"` global id and associated to that value instead.\r\n\r\nAs a safety measure, I've changed the 2int maps to have a default value of -1, and check that the globalid is in range before writing it to the column to ensure mistakes like this don't happen in the future, which caught a pretty serious regression introduced by #13653, caused by the simplified dictionary merging iterator that would result in segment dictionaries getting completely mangled if the same value was in more than 1 segment's dictionary. Luckily this didn't make it into any releases.\r\n\r\nThe added test data in `NestedDataColumnSupplierTest` would fail prior to this PR.\r\n\r\nUnrelated, this PR also moves some column selector tests that had nothing to do with scan queries out of `NestedDataScanQueryTest` into their own file.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-27T06:02:25Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:04:34Z","closed_at":"2023-02-01T04:59:20Z","merged_at":"2023-02-01T04:59:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec1e6ac8407066fe0f21835c733e1fb15b7d3b0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

note\r\n`/druid/indexer/v1/sampler` has been improved to now include `logicalDimension`, `physicalDimension` and `logicalSegmentSchema` which are a list of the most restrictive typed dimension schemas, the list of dimension schemas _actually used_ to sample the data,  and full resulting segment schema for the set of rows sampled respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by

Description\r\n\r\nFollowing from https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12105 with 1-20% CPU in `DimensionDictionary`, there are some improvements to be made to the `add()` path on the `StringDimensionIndexer`. The main concern is that the locking is more complicated than necessary.\r\n\r\nThere are three sub-changes:\r\n- Introduce a benchmark\r\n- Swap the existing lock implementation to use a StampedLock\r\n- Reduce the number of times we have to cross the lock\r\n\r\nEstimate this code reduces CPU by ~5-7% on our indexing jobs overall, with ~30% improvements to the uncontended path.\r\n\r\n### Related\r\n\r\n#12105, #12109, \r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * Introduce benchmark `StringDimensionIndexerProcessBenchmark`\r\n * `DimensionDictionary`

Description\r\n\r\nWhen running `REPLACE` queries, the segments which contain no data are dropped (marked as unused). This PR aims to generate tombstones in place of segments which contain no data to mark their deletion, as is the behavior with the native ingestion.   \r\n\r\nThis will cause `InsertCannotReplaceExistingSegmentFault` to be removed since it was generated if the interval to be marked unused didn't fully overlap one of the existing segments to replace.  \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n`REPLACE` in MSQ now generates tombstones instead of marking segment as unused.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ControllerImpl`\r\n * `TombstoneHelper`\r\n \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nAdd a new API to return the history of changes to automatic compaction config history to make it easy for users to see what changes have been made to their auto-compaction config.\r\n\r\nThe API is scoped per dataSource to allow users to triage issues with an individual dataSource. The API responds with a list of configs when there is a change to either the settings that impact all auto-compaction configs on a cluster or the dataSource in question.\r\n\r\nI had considered adding another API to expose the entire compaction config history as it was stored in the audit table, however I chose against doing this, as I didn't think users would want the ability to see this global view.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNew: You can now get the history of changes to automatic compaction config for a dataSource via an API.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DataSourceCompactionConfigHistory#add` - Ensures that only changes that affect a particular dataSource's auto-compaction config are added to the history\r\n * `CoordinatorCompactionConfigsResource#getCompactionConfigHistory` - the API endpoint\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

Description\r\nThis PR picks up where #6443 left off and merges `druid-core`, `extendedset`, and `druid-hll` into `druid-processing`. \r\n\r\nMy hope is that this is minimally disruptive to all open PRs, since its largely a straight move, the only expected conflicts coming from files which were newly added to the removed modules (which should be a very simple fix to move to the corresponding `processing/src/` path of the same package) as well as poms which have added dependency references.\r\n\r\nI chose `druid-processing` instead of `druid-core` because the latter was smaller, but I guess I don't feel super strongly either way about the final name, but have a slight affinity for this since it does contain basically all you need to make and query segments. Regardless of destination, all of these packages needed combined for this to work, since extendedset and hll depended on core, and processing depended on all 3.\r\n\r\nI tested that using pre-built extensions from older versions with these libraries split up continue to work when used with newer builds with consolidated `druid-processing`.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n`druid-core`, `extendedset`, and `druid-hll` modules have been consolidated into `druid-processing` to simplify dependencies. Any extensions referencing these should be updated to use `druid-processing` instead. Existing extension binaries _should_ continue to function normally when used with newer versions of Druid.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-20T13:03:41Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:03:06Z","closed_at":"2023-02-17T22:27:41Z","merged_at":"2023-02-17T22:27:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"08b5951cc53c4fe474a129500c62a6adad78337f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

enables \"merge\" style operations that combine multiple streams.\r\n\r\nThis change includes a naive implementation of one such merge operator just to provide concrete evidence that the refactoring is effective.\r\n\r\nThe primary intent of the change can be seen by looking at the `Operator` interface.  The change amounts to the\r\naddition of a `Signal` enumeration that allows the Receiver to signal back to the Operator that it needs to pause\r\nthings.  This then returns control to the caller to do something else (like call another Operator).  The vast majority of \r\noperators should never have to deal with this, but some that do merges will.\r\n\r\nThis interface change has made it possible to implement the `Yielder` interface in terms of an `Operator` again, which is a proof-point that this works.  On top of that, there is a concrete implementation of such a merge operator in `SortedInnerJoinOperator`, which implements a multi-way inner join across operators.  The class is almost entirely business logic for conducting the join rather than interactions with the Operator interface, so it is relatively large, but the intent was to prove that it is possible to create a meaningful \"merging\" operator on top of the interface changes, which it achieves.  I would recommend starting with the `SortedInnerJoinOperatorTest` when reviewing just because that will show the intended usage of the operator.\r\n\r\nNote, however, that this operator was created merely to exercise the interface change, as such it is not wired up into\r\nplanning no is there a query path that can exercise it yet.  Now that I am certain the interface can handle all of the\r\nneeds of the data processing pipeline, I intend to go back to fleshing out the full test suite for window functions\r\nand then can come back to this.\r\n\r\nIn terms of validation of the interface, there is likely one more validation to conduct, though I am fairly certain that it will be relatively simple and leave as a future exercise: the implementation of a `FrameProcessor` based on `Operator`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

PR is currently a draft. Resolving merge conflicts after splitting out some of the code to other PRs.\r\n\r\nPrior PRs added the catalog (table metadata) foundations, and an improved set of table functions. This PR brings it all together:\r\n\r\n* Validates the MSQ INSERT and REPLACE statements against the catalog\r\n  * Clustering, partitioning and other table details can be set in the catalog instead of the SQL statement\r\n  * Catalog types are loosely enforced for MSQ. (More work is needed to precisely enforce types.)\r\n  * The catalog can create a \"sealed\" table: only columns defined in the catalog can be used in MSQ.\r\n* Allows defining external tables and partial external tables (AKA \"connections\") in the catalog, then fill in the remaining details at runtime via a table function.\r\n* Allows parameters (including array parameters) to work with MSQ queries\r\n* Extends the PARTITION BY clause to accept string literals for the time partitioning\r\n* Extends MSQ to give the planner control over the type of the emitted segment columns\r\n* MSQ ITs to validate the new \"ad-hoc\" table functions\r\n* Documentation\r\n\r\nTo allow all the above to work:\r\n\r\n* Validation for MSQ statements moves out of the handers into a Druid-specific version of the SQL validator.\r\n* Druid-specific Calcite operator to represent a Druid ingest.\r\n* The catalog API is passed into the Druid planner (which required changes in the many tests that set up the planner).\r\n* The catalog can now be enabled in the Broker to allow the planner to interact with the Druid table metadata extension.\r\n* Many new tests to verify the catalog integration and improved MSQ statement validation.\r\n* Improved catalog type parsing in anticipation of supporting complex types.\r\n* Factored out the \"per run\" items from the planner into a planner toolbox, leaving just the \"per session\" items in the planner.\r\n* Resource shuttle now handles \"partial table functions\" for items defined in the catalog.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the full catalog functionality. See the documentation files for the details. In this version, the catalog is an extension: you must enable the catalog extension to use the catalog. Enabling the extension creates an additional table in your metadata database. We consider the catalog to be experimental, and the metadata table schema is subject to change.\r\n\r\nTable functions, introduced in a prior PR, are production ready and independent of the catalog. \"Partial table functions\" (define some of the properties in the catalog, some in SQL) are new in this PR and are experimental, along with the catalog itself.\r\n\r\n#### Hints to reviewers\r\n\r\nMuch of this PR is doc files, test code and minor cleanup. The core changes (those that could break a running system if done wrong) are:\r\n\r\n* `extensions-core/multi-stage-query/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/msq/*`\r\n* `sql/src/main/*`\r\n\r\nThe real core of this PR is `sql/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/sql/calcite/planner/DruidSqlValidator.java`: the place where we moved the former ad-hoc `INSERT` and `REPLACE` validation to instead run within the SQL validator.\r\n\r\nNo runtime code was changed: all the non-trivial changes are in the SQL planner.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-18T00:46:55Z","updated_at":"2024-06-09T00:20:00Z","closed_at":"2024-06-09T00:19:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fdf19c818108dbbe20421f188a81d64c6f9c0070","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cryptoe","id":2260045,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNjAwNDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2260045?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe","html_url":"https://github.com/cryptoe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cryptoe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

old ITs use DRUID_INTEGRATION_TEST_INDEXER. The new ones use the USE_INDEXER env var passed in from the build environment.\r\n\r\nThe old ITs set an environment variable `USE_INDEXER` in `travis.yml`, which Maven then converts to `DRUID_INTEGRATION_TEST_INDEXER`. The previous \"indexer\" PR used the `DRUID_INTEGRATION_TEST_INDEXER` to control the indexer settings in the new ITs.\r\n\r\nHowever, it turns out that the new ITs streamline the process: they just use `USE_INDEXER` passed in from `travis.yml` without the (unnecessary) translation step. This PR, rips out the use of `DRUID_INTEGRATION_TEST_INDEXER` in the new IT scripts and replaces that use with `USE_INDEXER` so we get a simple, straight pass-through from Travis (or GHA) to the script using the shell variables without the need of mucking about in Maven.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features

is currently a draft PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve the syntax for commonly used INSERT and REPLACE queries by adding new syntax that is more in line with the intention of the user.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is a need to delete all rows which match a certain condition, the user needs to run \r\n\r\n> REPLACE INTO datasource\r\n> SELECT * FROM datasource \r\n> WHERE ! \\<condition\\>\r\n> PARTITIONED BY <new partitioning>\r\n> [CLUSTERED BY <new clustering>]\r\n\r\nA much more intuitive format would be \r\n\r\n> DELETE FROM datasource\r\n> WHERE \\<condition\\>\r\n> PARTITIONED BY <new partitioning>\r\n> [CLUSTERED BY <new clustering>]\r\n\r\nThere is no new capabilities being added here, this is simply a better syntax for existing queries.\r\nTherefore, it is important to note that this is not a 'true' DELETE like in SQL. DELETE would still trigger a reingest of the datasource filtering out any rows that match the condition. There is some scope for improvement in the future depending on the condition here (such as directly dropping a segment if the condition aligns with the partition boundaries).\r\n\r\nThe partitioning and clustering is still required as delete still performs a reingest of the table behind the scenes, but this might go away once the catalog PR is merged.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\nFollowing up on #13653, this PR improves the flattener machinery to allow discovering nested columns when using druid schemaless ingestion powered by the nested column indexer for discovered columns, and moves the flag from `AppendableIndexSpec` to `DimensionsSchema`.\r\n\r\n\r\nEffectively, whenever \r\n```\r\n...\r\n    \"dimensionsSpec\": {\r\n        \"dimensions\": [],\r\n        \"useNestedColumnIndexerForSchemaDiscovery\": true\r\n...\r\n      },\r\n...\r\n```\r\nis set, this value is pushed down to the `FlattenerMaker` implementations which power the column discovery. \r\n\r\n`InputEntityReader` are fed an `InputRowSchema` which has access to the `DimensionsSchema` and so this value which can be passed into `FlattenerMaker` implementations, which have been updated to honor this setting.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a set of integration tests to test schemaless ingestion using `useNestedColumnIndexerForSchemaDiscovery` set to true with a variety of input formats. This test does not actually exercise the changes in this PR since the batch tests contain no nested data, but does at least cover string and numbers. I plan to add streaming integration tests in the future once the streaming tests are moved over to the new integration framework, and since those datas are generated I should be able to add some nested structure and provide integration test coverage for the full set of functionality.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-14T03:06:58Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:04:59Z","closed_at":"2023-01-18T20:57:28Z","merged_at":"2023-01-18T20:57:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb26a1093d11f0574dbb905ac0d39c8eb3777312","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

\"new ITs\" use Docker compose. As we add tests, we find we're creating a large amount of redundancy: each test \"category\" needs basically the same cluster, with a few variations. Some tests need both a Middle Manager and an Indexer version of the cluster. While Docker Compose provides some tools to reduce the resulting redundancy, we still find that we must maintain a large amount of copy/paste near-duplicates, with the maintenance cost which copy/paste implies.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses a set of Python scripts to generate the `docker-compose.yaml` files using \"templates.\" A base template provides all the boilerplate. A category-specific template adds test-specific customization. The `cluster.sh` script which launches the cluster checks if a test has a template file. If so, it generates the required `docker-compose.yaml` file on the fly when starting (or stopping) the cluster.\r\n\r\nA previous version of this PR used Bash scripts. By using Python, we build up a cluster definition as a tree of objects, then use PyYAML (which Druid already requires) to convert the tree to a YAML file. The result is much simpler than the Bash version because we work with the object tree, not text lines.\r\n\r\nThe result greatly reduces redundancy. Templates are only as complex as needed to express how some specific cluster differs from the \"standard\" Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nThis PR converts all the test categories except `MultiStageQueryWithMM`. The `cluster.sh` script works as previously if a category uses a \"static\" `docker-compose.yaml` file. It is transparent to the users of the test.\r\n\r\nTo see the code gen in action:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd integration-tests-ex/cases\r\ncluster/S3DeepStorage/docker-compose.sh\r\nmore target/cluster/S3DeepStorage/docker-compose.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code generator was validated by comparing the generated file against the existing hand-written file. Once validated, the hand-written file was deleted. If you want to do the same validation, just re-add the hand-written file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit checkout master integration-tests-ex/cases/cluster/S3DeepStorage/docker-compose.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Conditional MM vs. Indexer Tests\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a function to use to disable a specific test function if it only runs on MM or Indexer. See `guide.md` for the details.\r\n\r\n#### `MultiStageQueryWithMM`\r\n\r\nThe MSQ tests have two categories: one for Indexer, the other for MM. These tests should be modified to have just one test group and let the code gen pick indexer or MM. That is, revise the tests to eliminate the `MultiStageQueryWithMM` category.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-12T22:56:08Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:02:55Z","closed_at":"2023-02-21T23:03:02Z","merged_at":"2023-02-21T23:03:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"5dadbdf4d051a6843c87a05948cade84eb042a40","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

When the indexer is shut down and the INDEXER and PEON are un-announced the processing of the events is non-deterministic. If the PEON is processed first it generates a NPE in the DruidNodeDiscoveryProvider.ServiceDruidNodeDiscovery.FilteringUpstreamListener.nodesRemoved method. This results in the leakage of a ChangeRequestHttpSyncer that is syncing the segments on the INDEXER.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nThe K8sDruidDiscoveryNodeProvider.NodeRoleWatcher.keepWatching method that processes the kubernetes events explicitly prevents the propagation of events for nodes with no services. This prevents the NPE by preventing the events from flowing to the listeners that require services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n[druid-kubernetes-extensions] Prevent propagation of k8s add/delete events for nodes with no services\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `K8sDruidDiscoveryNodeProvider.NodeRoleWatcher` explicitly prevents propagation of k8s events for nodes with no services\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nAt startup the `indexer` node announces both an `INDEXER` (with services) and a `PEON` (with no services).  When the `indexer` is shut down and the `INDEXER` and `PEON` are un-announced the processing of the events is non-deterministic.  If the `PEON` is processed first it generates a NPE in the `DruidNodeDiscoveryProvider.ServiceDruidNodeDiscovery.FilteringUpstreamListener.nodesRemoved` method.  This results in the leakage of a `ChangeRequestHttpSyncer` that is syncing the segments on the `INDEXER`.  \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nThe `K8sDruidDiscoveryNodeProvider.NodeRoleWatcher.keepWatching` method that processes the kubernetes events explicitly prevents the propagation of events for nodes with no services.  This prevents the NPE by preventing the events from flowing to the listeners that require services. \r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n\r\nWhile downsampling, we exclude buckets which contain only a single key. However, there is an issue where if a bucket is downsampled to a single key (which is contained as the min value in a DelegateOrMinCollector), and if the same bucket is still the largest bucket that remains to be downsampled, the collector continues trying to downsample the same bucket infinitely. This adds a check to prevent this condition.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\n-->\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
