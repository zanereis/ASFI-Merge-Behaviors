Kafka controller only makes the partition reassignments completed only when all the target replicas are in-sync. If any target replica, not the adding one, is out-of-sync and all the adding replicas are in-sync, the partition reassignment would not be completed. Once the partition reassignment completed, the removing replicas would be stopped and replaced by the adding replicas. And the adding replicas must be in-sync, removing replicas might not. The availability and durability would be same at least or better after completing reassignment, so there is no need to wait all target replicas to be in-sync. Therefore, we can safely complete the partition reassignment when all adding replicas catching up regardless of other target replicas.","created_at":"2024-02-07T07:31:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-04T03:37:18Z","closed_at":"2025-01-04T03:37:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

has two replicas with rackIds i%3, (i+1)%3\r\n\r\nThe number of members, number of topics and number of partitions per topic can be changed to test different

this [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16226) explains, there is increased synchronization between application-thread, and the background thread as the background thread started to synchronized methods Metadata.currentLeader() in [original PR](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/14384). So this PR does the following changes\r\n1. Changes background thread, i.e. RecordAccumulator's partitionReady(), and drainBatchesForOneNode(), to not use `Metadata.currentLeader()`. Instead rely on `MetadataCache` that is immutable. So access to it is unsynchronized.\r\n2.  This PR repurposes `MetadataCache` as an immutable snapshot of Metadata. This is a wrapper around public `Cluster`. `MetadataCache`'s API/functionality should be extended for internal client usage Vs public `Cluster`. For example, this PR adds `MetadataCache.leaderEpochFor()`\r\n3. Rename `MetadataCache` to `MetadataSnapshot` to make it explicit its immutable.\r\n\r\n**Note both `Cluster` and `MetadataCache` are not syncronized, hence reduce synchronization from the hot path for high partition counts.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

fixes a bug that was causing that members wouldn't rejoin the group after receiving an error in the heartbeat response (ex. fenced, not coordinator, as reported in KAFKA-16215 and KAFKA-16178). The issue was that when receiving a response with error, the response receive time was not being updated, so following heartbeat would be skipped, considering that there was already a previous one inflight.\r\n\r\nTests updated to cover this.

patch addresses a few minor observability and operational concerns for ZK to KRaft migrations.\r\n\r\nThe \"MetadataType\" metric is added to both the brokers and controllers, as defined in KIP-866. The values are: 1 (ZooKeeper), 2 (KRaft), 3 (Dual-Write). The brokers will only ever report ZooKeeper or KRaft, while  the controller can also report Dual-Write depending on the state of the ZK migration.\r\n\r\nThe \"MigratingZkBrokerCount\" metric is added to the ZK controller, where the value will always be zero. This aligns this metric with the KRaft controller, which makes monitoring a bit simpler.\r\n\r\nDuring the ZK to KRaft migration, both of these metrics can be useful. Observing a non-zero MigratingZkBrokerCount means that the cluster is in a hybrid state with some ZK brokers and a KRaft controller. Also,     including a definitive metric for \"is this KRaft or ZK?\" is useful when observing brokers come up as KRaft during the migration process.","created_at":"2024-02-01T23:53:22Z","updated_at":"2025-01-04T03:37:15Z","closed_at":"2025-01-04T03:37:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5604089486,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABTgeejg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Stale

some rare cases, our integration tests observe that tasks are up and running for our sink connectors, and issue a subsequent request to stop the connector, before the consumers of these tasks have had a chance to form/join a group. When this happens, requests to alter/reset the offsets for the connector actually succeed, since the group either doesn't exist, or is completely empty.\r\n\r\nAs a quick fix, we can wait for offsets to be committed for the connector before stopping it and attempting to modify its offsets. This goes a bit further than necessary (we should only have to wait for at least one task's consumer to have formed/joined a group), but off the top of my head it was the cleanest and briefest way to guarantee that a group had been formed. It also makes a little more sense in the context of the test, since there's not much use in modifying connector offsets when none exist yet.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the assertion error messages generated when sink connectors do not catch up to the expected committed offsets in time are augmented with useful information about the expected and actual offsets.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

migrating from ZK mode to KRaft mode, the broker passes through a \"hybrid\" phase, in which it\r\nreceives LeaderAndIsrRequest and UpdateMetadataRequest RPCs from the KRaft controller. For the most\r\npart, these RPCs can be handled just like their traditional equivalents from a ZK-based controller.\r\nHowever, there is one thing that is different: the way topic deletions are handled.\r\n\r\nIn ZK mode, there is a \"deleting\" state which topics enter prior to being completely removed.\r\nPartitions stay in this state until they are removed from the disks of all replicas. And partitions\r\nassociated with these deleting topics show up in the UMR and LAIR as having a leader of -2 (which\r\nis not a valid broker ID, of course, because it's negative). When brokers receive these RPCs, they\r\nknow to remove the associated partitions from their metadata caches, and disks. When a full UMR or\r\nISR is sent, deleting partitions are included as well.\r\n\r\nIn hybrid mode, in contrast, there is no \"deleting\" state. Topic deletion happens immediately. We\r\ncan do this because we know that we have topic IDs that are never reused. This means that we can\r\nalways tell the difference between a broker that had an old version of some topic, and a broker\r\nthat has a new version that was re-created with the same name. To make this work, when handling a\r\nfull UMR or LAIR, hybrid brokers must compare the full state that was sent over the wire to their\r\nown local state, and adjust accordingly.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, the code for handling those adjustments had several major flaws. The biggest flaw\r\nis that it did not correctly handle the \"re-creation\" case where a topic named FOO appears in the\r\nRPC, but with a different ID than the broker's local FOO. Another flaw is that a problem with a\r\nsingle partition would prevent handling the whole request.\r\n\r\nIn ZkMetadataCache.scala, we handle full UMR requests from KRaft controllers by rewriting the UMR\r\nso that it contains the implied deletions. I fixed this code so that deletions always appear at the\r\nstart of the list of topic states. This is important for the re-creation case since it means that a\r\nsingle request can both delete the old FOO and add a new FOO to the cache. Also, rather than\r\nmodifying the requesst in-place, as the previous code did, I build a whole new request with the\r\ndesired list of topic states. This is much safer because it avoids unforseen interactions with\r\nother parts of the code that deal with requests (like request logging). While this new copy may\r\nsound expensive, it should actually not be. We are doing a \"shallow copy\" which references the\r\nprevious list topic state entries.\r\n\r\nI also reworked ZkMetadataCache.updateMetadata so that if a partition is re-created, it does not\r\nappear in the returned set of deleted TopicPartitions. Since this set is used only by the group\r\nmanager, this seemed appropriate. (If I was in the consumer group for the previous iteration of\r\nFOO, I should still be in the consumer group for the new iteration.)\r\n\r\nOn the ReplicaManager.scala side, we handle full LAIR requests by treating anything which does not\r\nappear in them as a \"stray replica.\" (But we do not rewrite the request objects as we do with UMR.)\r\nI moved the logic for finding stray replicas from ReplicaManager into LogManager. It makes more\r\nsense there, since the information about what is on-disk is managed in LogManager. Also, the stray\r\nreplica detection logic for KRaft mode is there, so it makes sense to put the stray replica\r\ndetection logic for hybrid mode there as well.\r\n\r\nSince the stray replica detection is now in LogManager, I moved the unit tests there as well.\r\nPreviously some of those tests had been in BrokerMetadataPublisherTest for historical reasons.\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of the new LAIR logic is that it takes topic ID into account.

PR fixes a couple of things related to the #15193 PR.\r\n\r\nWhen you complete \"Enter Migration Mode on the brokers\", we are actually in \"Enabling the migration on the brokers\" referring to the migration guide and the broker doesn't really have `node.id` yet but still `broker.id`, so the PR removes a statement saying to replace the one with the other.\r\n\r\nAlso, during rollback it's not enough just deleting the `/controller` znode quickly after shutting down controllers because the controller election doesn't start yet until at least one broker is rolled back with the right configuration. Until the rolling and when controllers are down, the brokers just log something like this even if you deleted the znode \"quickly\":\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n[2024-01-30 09:27:52,394] DEBUG

in the following https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15127 introduced a regression for `kafka-clients` pom where runtime dependencies were not included in the `kafka-clients` pom. The PR has a workaround to add the dependencies defined as `shadow/runtime` dependencies for `shadowJar` in clients `pom`.\r\n\r\nThough `project.shadow.component(mavenJava)` earlier used to add the runtime dependencies itself but as that creates an issue with `signing` of the jar which was removed in PR https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15127 hence this workaround is needed to add the `runtime` dependencies in pom.\r\n\r\n#### Difference in pom from 3.6.2 release:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 2 32 25

client authenticate failed, the server will log with the client IP address only. The the IP address sometimes cannot represent a specific user, especially if there is proxy between client and server. Ex:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO [SocketServer listenerType=ZK_BROKER, nodeId=0] Failed authentication with /127.0.0.1 (channelId=127.0.0.1:9093-127.0.0.1:53223-5) (Authentication failed: Invalid username or password) (org.apache.kafka.common.network.Selector)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf there are many failed authentication log appeared in the server, it'd be better to identify who is triggering it soon. Adding the client info to the log is a good start. This PR adds the user info in the log if any. After this PR, the log will be like this:\r\n```\r\nINFO [SocketServer listenerType=ZK_BROKER, nodeId=0] Failed authentication with /127.0.0.1 (channelId=127.0.0.1:9093-127.0.0.1:54700-0) (Authentication failed: Invalid username or password for user {abc}) (org.apache.kafka.common.network.Selector)\r\n```\r\nI tried to add the info in the caller side (i.e. [Selector](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/network/Selector.java#L611)), but we only have KafkaChannel info there, we cannot get client info (i.e. principle) if authentication is not successful.

the reconciliation logic on the client is triggered when a new target assignment is received and resolved, or when new unresolved target assignments are discovered in metadata.\r\n\r\nThis change improves this by triggering the reconciliation logic on each poll iteration, to reconcile whatever is ready to be reconciled. This would require changes to support poll on the MembershipManager, and integrate it with the current polling logic in the background thread. Receiving a new target assignment from the broker, or resolving new topic names via a metadata update could only ensure that the #assignmentReadyToReconcile is properly updated (currently done), but wouldn't trigger the #reconcile() logic, leaving that to the #poll() operation.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

current reconciliation code in `AsyncKafkaConsumer`s `MembershipManager` may lose part of the server-provided assignment when metadata is delayed. The reason is incorrect handling of partially resolved topic names, as in this example:\r\n\r\n * We get assigned `T1-1` and `T2-1`\r\n * We reconcile `T1-1`, `T2-1` remains in `assignmentUnresolved` since the topic id T2 is not known yet\r\n * We get new cluster metadata, which includes `T2`, so `T2-1` is moved to `assignmentReadyToReconcile`\r\n * We call reconcile -- `T2-1` is now treated as the full assignment, so `T1-1` is being revoked\r\n * We end up with assignment `T2-1`, which is inconsistent with the broker-side target assignment.\r\n\r\nGenerally, this seems to be a problem around semantics of the internal collections `assignmentUnresolved` and `assignmentReadyToReconcile`. Absence of a topic in `assignmentReadyToReconcile` may either mean revocation of the topic partition(s), or unavailability of a topic name for the topic, depending on the context.\r\n\r\nThis change reimplements that part of the internal state of `MembershipManagerImpl` with simpler and more correct invariants by using a single collection `currentTargetAssignment` which is based on topic IDs and always corresponds to the latest assignment received from the broker. During every attempted reconciliation, all topic IDs will be resolved from the local cache, which should not introduce a lot of overhead. `assignmentUnresolved` and `assignmentReadyToReconcile` are removed. \r\n\r\nThis change is in line with the goal of using topic IDs instead of topic names in the consumer internal state, and fixes the bug of losing partitions when delayed metadata arrives.\r\n\r\nA unit test testing the above situation is added.\r\n\r\nNote, that this change does not fully the reconciliation problems, because if a new assignment or new metadata arrives during an ongoing reconciliation, it will rely on the broker to re-send the assignment for it to be applied. This will be solved in a separate change (KAFKA-15832).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16196\r\n- The Cast transform currently doesn't handle invalid whole value casts gracefully. A whole value cast is configured like `{\"spec\": \"int8\"}` as opposed to a field level cast like `{\"spec\": \"field1:int8\"}`.\r\n- If an invalid field level cast is specified (for instance - `{\"spec\": \"field1:invalid\"}`), this results in a `ConfigException` being thrown here - https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/5f410ceb04878ca44d2d007655155b5303a47907/connect/transforms/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/transforms/Cast.java#L416 which is handled gracefully as a validation error here - https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/5f410ceb04878ca44d2d007655155b5303a47907/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/config/ConfigDef.java#L605-L609\r\n- However, invalid whole value casts (for instance - `{\"spec\": \"invalid\"}`) aren't handled appropriately and result in an \r\n`IllegalArgumentException` being thrown, which surfaces as an uncaught exception and a `500 Internal Server Error` response from the connector create / update / config validation REST API endpoint.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

output captured during tests is combined for every test in the suite and stored in a single location. This makes it difficult to diagnose CI failures since that combined test output is truncated if it exceeds a certain length, which often means that output for entire test cases at a time gets completely wiped.\r\n\r\nThe change here causes output to be stored per test case (i.e., method) instead of suite (i.e., class), which should make more information available and reduce the impact of truncation. If/when it becomes possible to store complete test output for failing tests only (this is currently not feasible with the Jenkins JUnit plugin), it will also allow us to retain less test output since we'll be able to store the output of individual failed cases instead of entire suites that may only contain one or two failures.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if this approach works for JUnit 5 or not, so I'm opening this PR as a draft for now. If/when I've been able to validate compatibility, I'll mark it ready for review.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ]

patch extends the Admin client to support describing new consumer groups with the ConsumerGroupDescribe API introduced in KIP-848. Users will continue to use the `Admin#describeConsumerGroups` API. The admin client does all the magic. Basically, the admin client always tries to describe the requested groups with the ConsumerGroupDescribe API to start with. If all the groups are there, great, the job is done. If there are groups unresolved groups due to a UNSUPPORTED_VERSION or GROUP_ID_NOT_FOUND error, the admin client tries with the DescribeGroups API.\r\n\r\nThe patch also adds fields to the data structure returned by `Admin#describeConsumerGroups` as stated in the KIP.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

KIP-714 defines broker metrics [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-714%3A+Client+metrics+and+observability#KIP714:Clientmetricsandobservability-Metrics) which should help determining the client instances metrics managed by the broker. However, there is certain change as per the metrics defined in KIP and the implementation which have been highlighted below. We can discuss and either amend the KIP or the implementation, though I prefer the former.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 ways 2 emit metrics in broker i.e. using Kafka Metrics or Yammer Metrics. I have used Kafka Metrics as want to have minimal dependency on Yammer (though open for suggestions).\r\n\r\n**Changes/Query** | Metric Name | Type | Group | Tags\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nWhat should be the name of the tag for broker's version and how can we fetch that as I do not see any placeholder in RequestContext?  | ClientMetricsInstanceCount | Gauge | ClientMetrics | version: broker's software version\r\nThe metric is defined as Meter which according to KafkaMetrics requires another metric called Rate hence 2 metrics are emitted for same as `ClientMetricsPluginErrorCount` and `ClientMetricsPluginErrorRate` | ClientMetricsPluginErrorCount | Meter | ClientMetrics | client_instance_idreason (reason for the failure)\r\nThe metric is defined as Meter which according to KafkaMetrics requires another metric called Rate hence 2 metrics are emitted for same as `ClientMetricsPluginExportCount` and `ClientMetricsPluginExportRate` | ClientMetricsPluginExportCount | Meter | ClientMetrics | client_instance_id\r\nThe metric is defined as Meter which according to KafkaMetrics requires another metric called Rate hence 2 metrics are emitted for same as `ClientMetricsThrottleCount` and `ClientMetricsThrottleRate` | ClientMetricsThrottleCount | Meter | ClientMetrics | client_instance_id\r\nThe metric is defined as Meter which according to KafkaMetrics requires another metric called Rate hence 2 metrics are emitted for same as `ClientMetricsUnknownSubscriptionRequestCount` and `ClientMetricsUnknownSubscriptionRequestRate`. Also removed the client version tag. | ClientMetricsUnknownSubscriptionRequestCount | Meter | ClientMetrics | client version: client's software version\r\nThe metric is defined as Histogram but generally we use `Avg` and `Max` as metrics to capture `latency` related metrics (which requires Histogram) hence I have 2 metrics for same as `ClientMetricsPluginExportTimeAvg` and

current liveness check for workers is not very effective, as it does not guarantee that workers have actually joined the cluster, read to the end of the config topic, etc. This has the effect that some REST requests are made against workers that haven't fully completed startup, which can result in 409 responses. By improving our worker liveness check, we ensure that the cluster is stable before issuing REST requests against it.\r\n\r\nNote that this check should be replaced by pinging a dedicated health check endpoint if/when one is introduced. I've published [KIP-1017](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-1017%3A+Health+check+endpoint+for+Kafka+Connect) to add a health check endpoint to the REST API, but I'm hoping we can settle on this (somewhat hacky) approach in the meantime.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI
