PR is attempting to resolve a UX confusion.\r\n\r\nThe issue: sometimes the datasources tab shows a datasource to be \"Fully compacted\" when in fact there are segments that should be compacted. I believe that the cause of this (or at least one of the causes) is that there are segments in the \"skipOffsetFromLatest\" interval and the user does not realize that they are getting skipped (by design).\r\n\r\nSolution, if there are skipped segments, instead of rendering the status as \"Fully compacted\" render it as \"Fully compacted (except the last P1D of data, 24 segments skipped)` where P1D is the skipOffsetFromLatest setting and 24 is the number of segments skipped. This simply makes the label more truthful and potentially less confusing.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1589\" alt=\"image\"

is based on #12750 and #10407\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- Track bytes processed by a task and expose in task reports along with row stats\r\n- Supported for classic batch and streaming ingestion\r\n- Not supported for MSQ ingestion in this PR\r\n- Not supported for `FirehoseToInputSourceReaderAdaptor`\r\n- `processedBytes` measure the uncompressed input bytes. e.g. in case of the sample \"wikipedia\" datasource, it measures the total size of the unzipped `wikipedia.json` file (and not the `wikipedia.json.gz`)\r\n- Records that are counted as `unparseable`, `thrownAway` or `processedWithErrors` also count towards `processedBytes`\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n- Add class `InputStats` to track processed bytes\r\n- Add method `InputSourceReader.read(InputStats)` to read input rows while counting bytes.\r\n> Since we need to count the bytes, we could not just have a wrapper around `InputSourceReader` or `InputEntityReader` (the way `CountableInputSourceReader` does) because the `InputSourceReader` only deals with `InputRow`s and the byte information is already lost.\r\n- Classic batch: Use the new `InputSourceReader.read(inputStats)` in `AbstractBatchIndexTask`\r\n- Streaming: Increment `processedBytes` in `StreamChunkParser`. This does not use the new `InputSourceReader.read(inputStats)` method.\r\n- Extend `InputStats` with `RowIngestionMeters` so that bytes can be exposed in task reports\r\n\r\n### Tests and refactors\r\n- Update tests to verify the value of `processedBytes`\r\n   - `HdfsInputSourceTest`\r\n   - `S3InputSourceTest`\r\n   - `GCSInputSourceTest`\r\n   - `OssInputSourceTest`\r\n   - `SqlInputSourceTest`\r\n   - `DruidSegmentReaderTest`\r\n   - `KinesisIndexTaskTest`\r\n   - `KafkaIndexTaskTest`\r\n- Rename `MutableRowIngestionMeters` to `SimpleRowIngestionMeters` and remove duplicate class\r\n- Replace `CacheTestSegmentCacheManager` with `NoopSegmentCacheManager`\r\n- Refactor `KafkaIndexTaskTest` and `KinesisIndexTaskTest`\r\n\r\n### Pending items\r\n- docs\r\n\r\n### Further work\r\n- Support for MSQ ingestion\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\nTrack bytes processed by a task and publish them in the task report along with the row stats.\r\n\r\nSample row stats in a task report:\r\n```json\r\n\"rowStats\": {\r\n    \"buildSegments\": {\r\n        \"processed\": 24433,\r\n        \"processedBytes\": 11956576,\r\n        \"processedWithError\": 0,\r\n        \"thrownAway\": 0,\r\n        \"unparseable\": 0\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\n\r\nBatch ingestion\r\n<img width=\"369\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18635897/207246969-e0d04eb3-5e40-4f25-a906-e0ae2b51b2f1.png\">\r\n\r\nStreaming ingestion\r\n<img width=\"383\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18635897/207246988-23c9f584-a0b8-4a70-81b7-69e56123b625.png\">\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR overhauls `ProtobufInputFormat` to use a new `ProtobufFlattenerMaker` that works by converting Protobuf `Message` directly to plain java types rather than printing to a JSON string and then deserializing that into `JsonNode` with Jackson. This is roughly based on the `JsonFormat` conversion code that we were previously using, but without the performance penalty this inflicts. I haven't measured it, but for actually flat schemas this should be approximately the same cost as the old way of not using the flattener since it is doing the same `getAllFields` to convert the top level `Message` to a `Map`.\r\n\r\nWhile I was here, i extracted a base type, `FlattenerJsonProvider` for the common code shared between most implementations.\r\n\r\nI've also added tests for using Druid nested columns and JSON transform functions (which is what motivated this change, because they both prefer to work on plain java types).\r\n\r\nI did not update `ProtobufInputRowParser` because I don't care about Hadoop, but if anyone does it should be possible to wire this up.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ProtobufInputFormat`\r\n * `ProtobufReader`\r\n * `ProtobufFlattenerMaker`\r\n * `ProtobufJsonProvider`\r\n * `ProtobufConverter `\r\n * `FlattenerJsonProvider `\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

to this patch, IndexedTable indexes are sorted IntList. This works great when we have a single-column join key: we simply retrieve the list and we know what rows match. However, when we have a composite key, we need to merge the sorted lists. This is inefficient when one is very dense and others are very sparse.\r\n\r\nThis patch switches from sorted IntList to IntSortedSet, and changes to the following intersection algorithm:\r\n\r\n1) Initialize the intersection set to the smallest matching set from the various parts of the composite key.\r\n\r\n2) For each element in that smallest set, check other sets for that element. If any do *not* include it, then remove the element from the intersection set.\r\n\r\nThis way, complexity scales with the size of the smallest set, not the largest one.\r\n\r\nI tried this out locally on a 3-part key with cardinalities 200, 200, and 300000. The test query completed in 1 second instead of 45 seconds.","created_at":"2022-12-07T03:28:28Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:03:03Z","closed_at":"2023-02-18T06:01:02Z","merged_at":"2023-02-18T06:01:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"882ae9f002d5f0c845e4a03d633a1959737066dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":120288359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjAyODgzNTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Performance","name":"Performance","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

adds support for framing  over ROWS for window aggregations.\r\n\r\nStill not implemented as yet:\r\n1. RANGE frames\r\n2. Multiple different frames in the same query\r\n3. Frames on last/first functions\r\n\r\nThis PR also brings with it some adjustments and improvements to the tests for semantic interfaces and RowsAndColumns implementations.\r\n\r\nThe PR touches a lot of files, that's mostly because I combined all of the \"semantic interfaces\" into a `semantic` package and that affected a bunch of imports.\r\n\r\nThe PR also looks like it's a lot of lines of code, but most of that is actually whitespace changes on some of the test files done by auto-formatting.  Checking them in now so that future auto-formatting is safe from generating whitespace changes.\r\n\r\nThe primary code to review is essentially all inside of FramedOnHeapAggregatable, the tests associated with it and some in the planning.\r\n\r\nLastly, there are some code cleanup/renames being included that were asked for in the previous PR.  (Things like completing the renaming of `cell` and removing the TODOs)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-07T00:42:58Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:06:24Z","closed_at":"2022-12-15T02:04:39Z","merged_at":"2022-12-15T02:04:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"089d8da5610453549fc9c305046f0b7397500b47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\n-->\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

a distributed sort-merge join algorithm for MSQ.\r\n\r\nThe main changes are in the processing, multi-stage-query, and sql modules.\r\n\r\nprocessing module:\r\n\r\n1) Rename SortColumn to KeyColumn, replace boolean descending with KeyOrder.\r\n   This makes it nicer to model hash keys, which use KeyOrder.NONE.\r\n\r\n2) Add nullability checkers to the FieldReader interface, and an\r\n   \"isPartiallyNullKey\" method to FrameComparisonWidget. The join\r\n   processor uses this to detect null keys.\r\n\r\n3) Add WritableFrameChannel.isClosed and OutputChannel.isReadableChannelReady\r\n   so callers can tell which OutputChannels are ready for reading and which\r\n   aren't.\r\n\r\n4) Specialize FrameProcessors.makeCursor to return FrameCursor, a random-access\r\n   implementation. The join processor uses this to rewind when it needs to\r\n   replay a set of rows with a particular key.\r\n\r\n5) Add MemoryAllocatorFactory, which is embedded inside FrameWriterFactory\r\n   instead of a particular MemoryAllocator. This allows FrameWriterFactory\r\n   to be shared in more scenarios.\r\n\r\nmulti-stage-query module:\r\n\r\n1) ShuffleSpec: Add hash-based shuffles. New enum ShuffleKind helps callers\r\n   figure out what kind of shuffle is happening. The change from SortColumn\r\n   to KeyColumn allows ClusterBy to be used for both hash-based and sort-based\r\n   shuffling.\r\n\r\n2) WorkerImpl: Add ability to handle hash-based shuffles. Refactor the logic\r\n   to be more readable by moving the work-order-running code to the inner\r\n   class RunWorkOrder, and the shuffle-pipeline-building code to the inner\r\n   class ShufflePipelineBuilder.\r\n\r\n3) Add SortMergeJoinFrameProcessor and factory.\r\n\r\n4) WorkerMemoryParameters: Adjust logic to reserve space for output frames\r\n   for hash partitioning. (We need one frame per partition.)\r\n\r\nsql module:\r\n\r\n1) Add sqlJoinAlgorithm context parameter; can be \"broadcast\" or\r\n   \"sortMerge\". With native, it must always be \"broadcast\", or it's a\r\n   validation error. MSQ supports both. Default is \"broadcast\" in\r\n   both engines.\r\n\r\n2) Validate that MSQs do not use broadcast join with RIGHT or FULL join,\r\n   as results are not correct for broadcast join with those types. Allow\r\n   this in native for two reasons: legacy (the docs caution against it,\r\n   but it's always been allowed), and the fact that it actually *does*\r\n   generate correct results in native when the join is processed on the\r\n   Broker. It is much less likely that MSQ will plan in such a way that\r\n   generates correct results.\r\n\r\n3) Remove subquery penalty in DruidJoinQueryRel when using sort-merge\r\n   join, because subqueries are always required, so there's no reason\r\n   to penalize them.\r\n\r\n4) Move previously-disabled join reordering and manipulation rules to\r\n   FANCY_JOIN_RULES, and enable them when using sort-merge join. Helps\r\n   get to better plans where projections and filters are pushed down.","created_at":"2022-12-06T08:05:55Z","updated_at":"2023-04-10T23:01:20Z","closed_at":"2023-03-08T22:19:40Z","merged_at":"2023-03-08T22:19:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"82f7a5647571ab38659739e0fce806e3f0cfb688","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\n-->\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

The current data source analysis involves a lot of instanceof checks and with the addition of future datasources is going to be messy. Moreover these are the issues found with the analysis:\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The top level datasource is always known when the analysis is created so there is no need for that to be present in analysis. Actually analysis.getDataSource() is same as the datasource which created the analysis using the forDataSource call\r\n\r\n3. Each datasource has a isGlobal check, no need for it to be a part of analysis\r\n\r\n4. Complex instance of checks in the forDataSource method\r\n\r\n5. isQuery check is basically checking if top level data source is an instance of QueryDataSource which can be taken care of by the callee.\r\n\r\nThis refactoring is to address these issues and move the analysis inside data source. A new method `getAnalysis()` is introduced in each datasource. For getting the base query a new method is added in DataSourceAnalysis that gets triggered through QueryDataSource for adding the baseQuery to the analysis only if there is no baseQuery present. This ensures that while moving up the tree, the lowermost baseQuery is stored in the DataSourceAnalysis object. The test cases have been updated to use these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#10600.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue when `druid.serverview.type=http` is set, the mechanics of which use “long polling” to keep track of which servers have which segments, which interferes with the data node “graceful” shutdown of the Jetty server (the period is controlled by `druid.server.http.gracefulShutdownTimeout`). The default timeout for the long polling requests is 4 minutes, which is much longer than the 30s default request timeout, so the requests never finish, the jetty server blocks for the entire `gracefulShutdownTimeout`, and leaves an ugly error about `TimeoutException` for the request that was not completed within the timeout.\r\n\r\nThis happens consistently with both realtime streaming tasks and historical servers.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to make `ChangeRequestHistory` which is the historical side mechanism that serves the segment changes to brokers and coordinators be tied into the ‘announcement’ phase of the lifecycle, so that the futures can be resolved and the executor shutdown before we begin shutting down jetty, which will ensure that these requests do not tie up the jetty threads for something that isn’t going to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

address: https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/5709\r\n\r\nThis is a problem we experienced.  When nodes go down unexpectedly, queries in flight will fail.  We want druid to retry these segments for the failed historicals since we have replication > 1.  \r\n\r\nThis adds missing segments to the context when a channel disconnect happens so the RetryQueryRunner can make the query.  \r\n\r\nI wanted to put up this PR and get some eyes on it first as testing this is a bit tricky so I will have to do a bit of refactoring.  Before I go down the refactoring path, I want to make sure I'm not doing something outlandish.  If this looks good to folks, I can try and add some tests.

Description\r\n\r\nAs of now, executing a query can sometimes give truncated results. This can happen when the server starts streaming the response to the client but fails before the whole response has been streamed back. The most common situation here is query timeout. If all the results are not streamed back in the `timeout` period, then the response gets cut. The client sees a 200 OK response and tries to parse the JSON.  \r\n\r\nWe have built some solutions for this. There is no generic solution but implemented depending on the result format (CSV, Array, Object, etc.) and query protocol (SQL/JSON). We add some newline characters and if the client doesn't see those newline characters at the end, it considers the response truncated. This, however, doesn't work with clients that speak standard HTTP language such as curl. \r\n\r\nThere is a provision in the chunked encoding mechanism to signal truncated responses. The server sends a final terminating chunk and the client uses that terminating chunk to confirm that response is complete. Jetty is supposed to do the same but for some reason, it sends a terminating chunk even if the response is incomplete. I verified this by running Wireshark locally and inspecting the frames\r\n\r\nFor a truncated response\r\n![Screenshot 2022-12-05 at 1 08 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1477457/205580773-bc7930c8-38e0-431a-9bb7-bbb1f64d05b2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a complete response\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-12-05 at 1 09 07 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1477457/205580813-ee7a1efc-a989-45eb-898a-82fdf15819a4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut then, I also found this [commit](https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/commit/0d1fca545c053315ba56c27e3b2dff27de226715) that clearly has a fix and even a test case to verify the behavior we want.  \r\n\r\nAfter doing a bit more fiddling, I realized that we are closing the `ResultWriter` in `SqlResource` try-block and that, in turn, closes the response output stream. That effectively signals the end of the response and the timeout exception in the query is thrown afterward. At this point, throwing an exception would likely have no effect on the response bits being sent by Jetty. \r\n\r\nTo fix this, I have disabled the auto-closing of the target output stream in all of the writers used in SqlResource. I have modified the docs of `ResultWriter#close` to call out explicitly that they must not close the output stream. \r\n\r\nHere is what I get using a `curl` command to issue a query\r\n\r\nBefore the fix\r\n\r\n```\r\n< Vary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent\r\n< Content-Encoding: gzip\r\n< Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n<\r\n{ [13 bytes data]\r\n100 1295k    0 1295k  100   255   221k     43  0:00:05  0:00:05 --:--:--  5789\r\n* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix\r\n\r\n```\r\n< Vary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent\r\n< Content-Encoding: gzip\r\n< Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n<\r\n{ [13 bytes data]\r\n100 1443k    0 1443k  100   255   172k     30  0:00:08  0:00:08 --:--:--     0* transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining\r\n100 1443k    0 1443k  100   255   172k     30  0:00:08  0:00:08 --:--:--     0\r\n* Closing connection 0\r\ncurl: (18) transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<TODO>\r\n\r\n### Key changes\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12795\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

`apache/druid`!\r\n\r\nThis is not an automatic, 🤖-generated PR, as you can check in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/p-), I work for GitHub and I am part of the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) which is helping out with the migration of LGTM configurations to Code Scanning.\r\nYou might have heard that we've integrated LGTM's underlying CodeQL analysis engine natively into GitHub. The result is [__GitHub code scanning__](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning)!\r\n\r\nWith LGTM fully integrated into code scanning, we are focused on improving CodeQL within the native GitHub code scanning experience. In order to take advantage of current and future improvements to our analysis capabilities, we suggest you enable code scanning on your repository. Please take a look at our [blog post for more information](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/).\r\n\r\nThis pull request enables code scanning by adding an auto-generated [`codeql.yml` workflow file for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-manually) to your repository — take a look! We tested it before opening this pull request, so all should be working :heavy_check_mark:. In fact, you might already have seen some alerts appear on this pull request!\r\n\r\nWhere needed and if possible, we’ve adjusted the configuration to the needs of your particular repository. But of course, you should feel free to tweak it further! Check [this page](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#editing-a-code-scanning-workflow) for detailed documentation.\r\n\r\nQuestions? Check out the FAQ below!\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click here to expand the FAQ section</summary>\r\n\r\n#### How often will the code scanning analysis run?\r\nBy default, code scanning will trigger a scan with the CodeQL engine on the following events:\r\n* On every pull request — to flag up potential security problems for you to investigate before merging a PR.\r\n* On every push to your default branch and other protected branches — this keeps the analysis results on your repository’s *Security* tab up to date.\r\n* Once a week at a fixed time — to make sure you benefit from the latest updated security analysis even when no code was committed or PRs were opened.\r\n\r\n#### What will this cost?\r\nNothing! The CodeQL engine will run inside GitHub Actions, making use of your [unlimited free compute minutes for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#about-billing-for-github-actions).\r\n\r\n#### What types of problems does CodeQL find?\r\nThe CodeQL engine that powers GitHub code scanning is the exact same engine that powers LGTM.com. The exact set of rules has been tweaked slightly, but you should see almost exactly the same types of alerts as you were used to on LGTM.com: we’ve enabled the [`security-and-quality` query suite](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning#using-queries-in-ql-packs) for you.\r\n\r\n#### How do I upgrade my CodeQL engine?\r\nNo need! New versions of the CodeQL analysis are constantly deployed on GitHub.com; your repository will automatically benefit from the most recently released version.\r\n\r\n#### The analysis doesn’t seem to be working\r\nIf you get an error in GitHub Actions that indicates that CodeQL wasn’t able to analyze your code, please [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/troubleshooting-the-codeql-workflow) to debug the analysis.\r\n\r\n#### How do I disable LGTM.com?\r\nIf you have LGTM’s automatic pull request analysis enabled, then you can [follow these steps to disable the LGTM pull request analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/managing-automated-code-review#disabling-pr-integration). You don’t actually need to remove your repository from LGTM.com; it will automatically be removed in the next few months as part of the deprecation of LGTM.com ([more info here](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/)).\r\n\r\n#### Which source code hosting platforms does code scanning support?\r\nGitHub code scanning is deeply integrated within GitHub itself. If you’d like to scan source code that is hosted elsewhere, we suggest that you create a mirror of that code on GitHub.\r\n\r\n#### How do I know this PR is legitimate?\r\nThis PR is filed by the official LGTM.com GitHub App, in line with the [deprecation timeline that was announced on the official GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2022-08-15-the-next-step-for-lgtm-com-github-code-scanning/). The proposed GitHub Action workflow uses the [official open source GitHub CodeQL Action](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/). If you have any other questions or concerns, please join the discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/29534) in the official GitHub community!\r\n\r\n#### I have another question / how do I get in touch?\r\nPlease join the discussion [here](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/29534) to ask further questions and send us suggestions!\r\n\r\n</details>

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nHelps prevent the creation of an invalid LDAP group mapping when using the `druid-basic-security` extension.\r\n1. When creating a new mapping, It does a sanity check to make sure it can create an `LdapName` object using the pattern supplied. The LDAP server should through a naming exception if the pattern is invalid. If this is the case, return `400` to the caller.\r\n2. Allow the operator to provide a regex for the pattern being created if they want to. If there is no pattern provided, nothing is checked. If a pattern is provided, the user supplied pattern is matched against that regex, and if there is not a match, the request will fail.\r\n\r\nHelps behavior if an invalid LDAP group mapping exists in the metastore\r\n1. When getting roles, if an invalid pattern is discovered, that role is skipped instead of having an exception thrown which breaks the entire authenticator \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\n-->\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\nAdds an optional new configuration to druid-basic-security extension for those using LDAP integration.\r\n\r\n`druid.auth.authorizer.MyBasicLDAPAuthorizer.groupMappingGroupPatternRegex` is a pattern that all newly created group mapping patterns must match in order to be created.

Description\r\n\r\nThis commit adds support for Window functions to Druid.  The intent is to support window functions similarly to what postgresql does (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html) as well as Drill (https://drill.apache.org/docs/sql-window-functions-introduction/)\r\n\r\nThe commit is large and there is more work to do, but this lays the foundation of supporting window functions.  This PR is best read from a few entry points:\r\n\r\n1. The windowing functions are implemented as `Processor`s.  Looking at this interface will give an idea of how the actual window functions are implemented.  The biggest notion here is that `Processor`s deal with a `RowsAndColumns` object that represents a full partition.  Generally speaking, they believe that something else has prepared the `RowsAndColumns` for them which proves to be a nice simplifying assumption for their implementation.\r\n2. `RowsAndColumns` is an interface that represents a set of... rows and columns.  If you look at the interface, it is rather minimalist.  The idea here is to lean into the idea of `.as()` as has existed on Segments for a long time.  We use it to effectively build a \"menu\" of common, generic functionality that can be done on a batch of data and then Operators/Processors can be written in terms of that common, generic functionality.  The implementation in this PR provides naive implementations of this functionality, as we get deeper in future PRs, this functionality will get fleshed out and specialized more to avoid object copies and megamorphism while further offering love for vectorized processing.\r\n3. `Operator` is an interface introduced here.  `WindowOperatorQuery` is an operator-defined query for running Window operations on top of the results of a sub-query.  All of the logic for the operators is handled in `WindowOperatorQueryQueryToolChest.merge` right now.  Essentially, this PR has been co-opted to get Operators introduced into the Druid code base.  This means we are using window queries as an initial jumping off point for `Operators` to be introduced into the code flow.  We expect more and more iteration on this to expand the capabilities deeper and perhaps make a future world where Operator-only queries are a thing that Druid supports.\r\n4. `CalciteWindowQueryTest` leverages the recent changes that brought us the `QueryTestBuilder` to have fully file-driven tests.  For the window functions, we needed more data, so I've moved the wikipedia dataset that was checked in as part of `environment` to be in the `resources` of the test jar.  We then index that and reference it in the tests.  The tests sit in `calcite/tests/window` of resources, each file is a SQL query, the window Operator structure that we expect to be built from it and the expected results.  Hopefully, this will simplify the addition of test cases making it easier for someone to add a test without necessarily knowing how to work with the code and fix it.\r\n\r\nThat said, this PR introduces various things, but it is not complete yet.  This is a first step and there are still sharp edges/unimplemented functionality.  That said, what exists here does work for a subset of use cases and is a meaningful milestone that can be committed while we iterate on fleshing out and finishing up the functionality.  As such, I'd like to get this reviewed and committed before making it even larger.  All interfaces introduced in this PR are experimental and the \"windowOperator\" query is also intended to be experimental.  Given that this is still experimental, I am intending to merge this PR as an undocumented feature, which we will document better as we get the sharp edges resolved.\r\n\r\n#### Sharp Edges\r\n\r\n1. The window function support does not yet support \"frames\" (`ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEEDING AND 2 FOLLOWING` style clauses).\r\n2. The support is not yet fully aware of the difference between `RANGE` and `ROWS` when evaluating peers.  (The built-in functions are all implemented with the correctly defined semantics, similar to what the postgresql document says above)\r\n3. All window functions in one query must use the same windowing definition (the code cannot currently support 2 different `PARTITION BY X` clauses)\r\n4. The windowing logic will not re-sort the data.  It assumes that the sub-query was written such that data is pre-sorted in the way that the windowing logic expects.\r\n\r\nThese sharp edges are in the weeds enough that this support should still be considered experimental and it should exist as an undocumented feature.  Subsequent PRs will smooth out these sharp edges.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNone as the intent is for this to be an undocumented, experimental addition.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

PR addresses two things:\r\n\r\n1) Be more robust if an auxiliary query fails. For example the services view uses the `sys.servers` table to load most of the data but it also loads the workers from the coordinator. If the coordinator is down temporarily we do not want to fail the whole query, instead do the best we can with the info we have and also pop up an error toast notification that something went wrong.\r\n\r\n2) Following this discussion on Slack: https://apachedruidworkspace.slack.com/archives/C030K0Z7S1Z/p1669222099825209 the kill task dialog now lets you pick and interval and sets a default that does not include the future.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"426\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/203844123-8942938b-22f1-4f72-bf53-595ca1f41d19.png\">\r\n

PR pulls out of PR #13360  the revisions to the planner test framework. This PR continues the effort to enhance the Calcite test framework.\r\n\r\n* Adds unit tests for the various \"injector builder\" classes since they are getting to be non-trivial. That testing showed that we need to annotate some of the classes pulled in automatically by Guice when using the \"bar bones\" injector builders.\r\n* `SqlTestFramework` moves another step closer to being driven by Guice. A new method, `configureGuice()` allows using Druid modules to bring in dependencies. This method replaces a large amount of ad-hoc code that previously existed in Calcite tests.\r\n* `SqlTestFramework` also adds an `applyProperties(.)` method to let tests set up properly values to be used in tests. The method is put to work in several aggregate tests to select the aggregator to use for `COUNT DISTINCT`. The result replaces additional ad-hoc code.\r\n* Several previous `SqlTestFramework` methods are removed in favor of the above.\r\n* A new `PlannerCaptureHook`, patterned after Calcite's `QueryHook` class, captures information from the Druid planner for use in test verification.\r\n* The `QueryTestBuilder` and runner provide a way to compare the Calcite logical plan against an expected value. The plan is captured using the hook above.\r\n* Similarly, we can validate the SQL row schema against an expected schema. (The framework already has a way to compare the Druid row signature, using Druid types. This new form allows using SQL types.)\r\n* Retires some of the test-specific query component creation\r\n* Fixes query log hook race condition\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is

The three of these should provide some additional insight into how time was spent by the tasks on the pool to accompany the existing set of metrics (which actually exist now).\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n* Fix an issue which cause broker parallel merge pool metrics to not be emitted.\r\n* Added new broker query metric for total parallel merge processing 'wall' time\r\n* Added new broker query metrics for parallel merge pool time spent waiting for results of 'fastest' and 'slowest' partitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
