This prevents NullPointerExceptions if the operation or session ID is unknown. Instead, a warning is written to the log.\r\n\r\nTo improve robustness, we also make the following changes in HiveSessionImpl.close():\r\n\r\n- Catch any exception thrown by `operationManager.closeOperation`. If for any reason this throws an exception, other operations are not prevented from being closed.\r\n- Handle not being able to access the scratch directory. When closing, all `.pipeout` files are removed from the scratch directory, which would have resulted in an NPE if the directory does not exist.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe listener's update methods would throw an exception if the operation or session ID is unknown. In Spark 2, where the listener is called directly, this changes the caller's control flow. In Spark 3, the exception is caught by the ListenerBus but results in an uninformative NullPointerException.\r\n\r\nIn HiveSessionImpl.close(), if an exception is thrown when closing an operation, all following operations are not closed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe QueryPlanningTracker in QueryExeuction reports the planning time that also includes the optimization time. This happens because the optimizedPlan in QueryExecution is lazy and only will initialize when first called. When df.queryExecution.executedPlan is called, the the tracker starts recording the planning time, and then calls the optimized plan. This causes the planning time to start before optimization and also include the planning time.\r\nThis PR fixes this behavior by introducing a method assertOptimized, similar to assertAnalyzed that explicitly initializes the optimized plan. This method is called before measuring the time for sparkPlan and executedPlan.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe know that when MemoryConsumer acquire memory , if got size < acquired size,\r\nConsumerMemory will clear and spill some size to disk, then re-acquire execution memory.\r\nBut some times still got 0. Task break and re compute. Always this kind of task is heavy.\r\n\r\nWe know that one task's memory range is `maxExecutionSize / (2 * activeTaskNum) <  size  < maxExecutionSize / activeTaskNum`, if there are new coming task when busy ,  The amount of execution memory a task can use will be lower， in ExecutionMemoryPool.acquireMemory()\r\n```\r\n val maxPoolSize = computeMaxPoolSize()\r\n      val maxMemoryPerTask = maxPoolSize / numActiveTasks\r\n      val minMemoryPerTask = poolSize / (2 * numActiveTasks)\r\n\r\n      // How much we can grant this task; keep its share within 0 <= X <= 1 / numActiveTasks\r\n      val maxToGrant = math.min(numBytes, math.max(0, maxMemoryPerTask - curMem))\r\n      // Only give it as much memory as is free, which might be none if it reached 1 / numTasks\r\n      val toGrant = math.min(maxToGrant, memoryFree)\r\n```\r\ntoGrant will be 0  cause task throw OOM, then retry, it's heavy always. We can wait for other small task finish an d acquire memory again.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake task stronger\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR extracts the logic for selecting the planned join type out of the `JoinSelection` rule and moves it to `JoinSelectionHelper` in Catalyst.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change both cleans up the code in `JoinSelection` and allows the logic to be in one place and be used from other rules that need to make decision based on the join type before the planning time.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n`BuildSide`, `BuildLeft`, and `BuildRight` are moved from

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen reading/writing datetime values that before the rebase switch day, from/to Avro/Parquet files, fail by default and ask users to set a config to explicitly do rebase or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRebase or not rebase have different behaviors and we should let users decide it explicitly. In most cases, users won't hit this exception as it only affects ancient datetime values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now users will see an error when reading/writing dates before 1582-10-15 or timestamps before 1900-01-01 from/to Parquet/Avro files, with an error message to ask setting a config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `test-dependencies.sh` detect the version string correctly by ignoring all the other lines.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, all SBT jobs are broken like the following.\r\n- https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-branch-3.0-test-sbt-hadoop-3.2-hive-2.3/476/console\r\n```\r\n[error] running /home/jenkins/workspace/spark-branch-3.0-test-sbt-hadoop-3.2-hive-2.3/dev/test-dependencies.sh ; received return code 1\r\nBuild step 'Execute shell' marked build as failure\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the script detects the old version like `Falling back to archive.apache.org to download Maven 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT` when `build/mvn` did fallback.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, in the script, `OLD_VERSION` became `Falling back to archive.apache.org to download Maven 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT` instead of `3.1.0-SNAPSHOT` if build/mvn did fallback. Then, `pom.xml` file is corrupted like the following at the end and the exit code become `1` instead of `0`. It causes Jenkins jobs fails\r\n```\r\n-    <version>3.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\r\n+    <version>Falling</version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NO FALLBACK**\r\n```\r\n$ build/mvn -q -Dexec.executable=\"echo\" -Dexec.args='${project.version}' --non-recursive org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:exec\r\nUsing `mvn` from path: /Users/dongjoon/APACHE/spark-merge/build/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin/mvn\r\n3.1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n```\r\n\r\n**FALLBACK**\r\n```\r\n$ build/mvn -q -Dexec.executable=\"echo\" -Dexec.args='${project.version}' --non-recursive org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:exec\r\nFalling back to archive.apache.org to download Maven\r\nUsing `mvn` from path: /Users/dongjoon/APACHE/spark-merge/build/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin/mvn\r\n3.1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n```\r\n\r\n**In the script**\r\n```\r\n$ echo $(build/mvn -q -Dexec.executable=\"echo\" -Dexec.args='${project.version}' --non-recursive org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.6.0:exec)\r\nUsing `mvn` from path: /Users/dongjoon/APACHE/spark-merge/build/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin/mvn\r\nFalling back to archive.apache.org to download Maven 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR will prevent irrelevant logs like `Falling back to archive.apache.org to download Maven`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to register the executor source with the Spark metrics system when running in local mode.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe Apache Spark metrics system provides many useful insights on the Spark workload. \r\nIn particular, the [executor source metrics](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/docs/monitoring.md#component-instance--executor) provide detailed info, including the number of active tasks, I/O metrics, and several task metrics details. The executor source metrics, contrary to other sources (for example ExecutorMetrics source), is not available when running in local mode.\r\nHaving executor metrics in local mode can be useful when testing and troubleshooting Spark workloads in a development environment. The metrics can be fed to a dashboard to see the evolution of resource usage and can be used to troubleshoot performance,\r\nas [in this example](https://github.com/cerndb/spark-dashboard).\r\nCurrently users will have to deploy on a cluster to be able to collect executor source metrics, while the possibility of having them in local mode is handy for testing.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n- This PR exposes executor source metrics data when running in local mode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Manually tested by running in local mode and inspecting the metrics listed in http://localhost:4040/metrics/json/ \r\n- Also added a test in

user home is not always warehouse-related, unchangeable in runtime, and shared both by database and table as the parent directory. Meanwhile, we use the table path as the parent directory for relative partition locations.\r\n\r\nThe config `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` represents `the default location for managed databases and tables`.\r\nFor databases, the case above seems not to follow its semantics, because it should use ` `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` as the base path instead.\r\n\r\nFor tables, it seems to be right but here I suggest enriching the meaning that lets it also be the for external tables with relative paths for locations.\r\n\r\nWith changes in this PR,\r\n\r\nThe location of a database will be `warehouseDir/dbpath` when `dbpath` is relative.\r\nThe location of a table will be `dbpath/tblpath` when `tblpath` is relative. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nbugfix and improvement\r\n\r\nFirstly, the databases with relative locations should be created under the default location specified by `spark.sql.warehouse.dir`.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the external tables with relative paths may also follow this behavior for consistency.\r\n\r\nAt last, the behavior for database, tables and partitions with relative paths to choose base paths should be the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR changes the `createDatabase`, `alterDatabase`, `createTable` and `alterTable` APIs and related DDLs. If the LOCATION clause is followed by a relative path, the root path will be `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` for databases, and `spark.sql.warehouse.dir` / `dbPath` for tables.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n#### after \r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> desc database loctest;\r\nDatabase Name\tloctest\r\nComment\r\nLocation\tfile:/Users/kentyao/Downloads/spark/spark-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-SPARK-31709/spark-warehouse/loctest\r\nOwner\tkentyao\r\nspark-sql> use loctest;\r\nspark-sql> create table loctest(id int) location 'loctest';\r\n20/05/14 18:18:02 WARN InMemoryFileIndex: The directory file:/Users/kentyao/Downloads/spark/spark-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-SPARK-31709/loctest was not found.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen reading/writing datetime values that before the rebase switch day, from/to Avro/Parquet files, fail by default and ask users to set a config to explicitly do rebase or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRebase or not rebase have different behaviors and we should let users decide it explicitly. In most cases, users won't hit this exception as it only affects ancient datetime values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now users will see an error when reading/writing dates before 1582-10-15 or timestamps before 1900-01-01 from/to Parquet/Avro files, with an error message to ask setting a config.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nupdated

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe've seen some shuffle data corruption during shuffle read phase. \r\n\r\nAs described in SPARK-26089, spark only checks small  shuffle blocks before PR #23453, which is proposed by ankuriitg.\r\n\r\nThere are two changes/improvements that are made in PR #23453.\r\n\r\n1. Large blocks are checked upto maxBytesInFlight/3 size in a similar way as smaller blocks, so if a\r\nlarge block is corrupt in the starting, that block will be re-fetched and if that also fails,\r\nFetchFailureException will be thrown.\r\n2. If large blocks are corrupt after size maxBytesInFlight/3, then any IOException thrown while\r\nreading the stream will be converted to FetchFailureException. This is slightly more aggressive\r\nthan was originally intended but since the consumer of the stream may have already read some records and processed them, we can't just re-fetch the block, we need to fail the whole task. Additionally, we also thought about maybe adding a new type of TaskEndReason, which would re-try the task couple of times before failing the previous stage, but given the complexity involved in that solution we decided to not proceed in that direction.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think there still exists some problems with the current shuffle transmitted data verification mechanism:\r\n\r\n- For a large block, it is checked upto  maxBytesInFlight/3 size when fetching shuffle data. So if a large block is corrupt after size maxBytesInFlight/3, it can not be detected in data fetch phase.  This has been described in the previous section.\r\n- Only the compressed or wrapped blocks are checked, I think we should also check thease blocks which are not wrapped.\r\n\r\nThis pr complete the verification mechanism for shuffle transmitted data:\r\n\r\nFirstly, crc32 is choosed for the checksum verification  of shuffle data.\r\n\r\nCrc is also used for checksum verification in hadoop, it is simple and fast.\r\n\r\nDuring shuffle write phase, after completing the partitionedFile, we compute \r\n\r\nthe crc32 value for each partition and then write these digests with the indexs into shuffle index file.\r\n\r\nFor the sortShuffleWriter and unsafe shuffle writer, there is only one partitionedFile for a shuffleMapTask, so the compution of digests(compute the digests for each partition depend on the indexs of this partitionedFile) is  cheap.\r\n\r\nFor the bypassShuffleWriter, the reduce partitions is little than byPassMergeThreshold, so the cost of digests compution is acceptable.\r\n\r\nDuring shuffle read phase, the digest value will be passed with the block data.\r\n\r\nAnd we will recompute the digest of the data obtained to compare with the origin digest value.\r\nWhen recomputing the digest of data obtained, it only need an additional buffer(2048Bytes) for computing crc32 value.\r\nAfter recomputing, we will reset the obtained data inputStream, if it is markSupported we only need reset it, otherwise it is a fileSegmentManagerBuffer, we need recreate it.\r\n\r\nSo, I think this verification mechanism  proposed for shuffle transmitted data is efficient and complete.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-14T03:38:35Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T00:47:47Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T00:47:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ae5f59365f11c7d3d25a0ac6663bb4d83cfb3df4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28525/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28525/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28525/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c59fcd627f5132bf8ebe493a8f1282139b31f1cf","head":{"label":"turboFei:SPARK-27562","ref":"SPARK-27562","sha":"c59fcd627f5132bf8ebe493a8f1282139b31f1cf","user":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77131854,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzEzMTg1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"turboFei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"turboFei","id":6757692,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTc2OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6757692?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei","html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turboFei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/turboFei/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a private `WriteBuilder` mixin trait: `SupportsStreamingUpdate`, so that the builtin v2 streaming sinks can still support the update mode.\r\n\r\nNote: it's private because we don't have a proper design yet. I didn't take the proposal in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23702#discussion_r258593059 because we may want something more general, like updating by an expression `key1 = key2 + 10`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn Spark 2.4, all builtin v2 streaming sinks support all streaming output modes, and v2 sinks are enabled by default, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22911\r\n\r\nIt's too risky for 3.0 to go back to v1 sinks, so I propose to add a private trait to fix builtin v2 sinks, to keep backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now all the builtin v2 streaming sinks support all streaming output modes, which is the same as 2.4\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting tests.","created_at":"2020-05-13T17:25:24Z","updated_at":"2020-06-01T03:41:38Z","closed_at":"2020-05-20T03:45:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8df7031f7c17107f11d0358baf3f82ad65243f5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch effectively reverts SPARK-30098 via below changes:\r\n\r\n* Removed the config\r\n* Removed the changes done in parser rule\r\n* Removed the usage of config in tests\r\n  * Removed tests which depend on the config\r\n  * Rolled back some tests to before SPARK-30098 which were affected by SPARK-30098\r\n* Reflect the change into docs (migration doc, create table syntax)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-30098 brought confusion and frustration on using create table DDL query, and we agreed about the bad effect on the change.\r\n\r\nPlease go through the [discussion thread](http://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Resolve-ambiguous-parser-rule-between-two-quot-create-table-quot-s-td29051i20.html) to see the details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, compared to Spark 2.4.x. End users tried to experiment with Spark 3.0.0 previews will see the change that the behavior is going back to Spark 2.4.x, but I believe we won't guarantee compatibility in preview releases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting UTs.","created_at":"2020-05-12T23:13:37Z","updated_at":"2020-05-17T12:52:58Z","closed_at":"2020-05-17T02:27:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46bfe7cd1baaf58b29592857b6f6c71658fb47a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84c172fb20321b082fc98fa419f9756ec44a6a7e","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:revert-SPARK-30098","ref":"revert-SPARK-30098","sha":"84c172fb20321b082fc98fa419f9756ec44a6a7e","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently while implementing pagination using the existing pagination framework, a lot of code is being copied as pointed out [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28485#pullrequestreview-408881656).\r\n\r\nI introduced some changes in `PagedTable` which is the main trait for implementing the pagination. \r\n* Added function for getting table parameters.\r\n* Added a function for table header row. This will help in maintaining consistency across the tables. All the header rows across tables will be consistent now.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n* A lot of code is copied every time pagination is implemented for any table.\r\n* Code readability is not great as lot of HTML is embedded.\r\n* Paginating other tables will be a lot easier now.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually. This is mainly refactoring work, no new functionality introduced. Existing test cases should pass.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->","created_at":"2020-05-12T18:09:11Z","updated_at":"2020-05-21T18:06:29Z","closed_at":"2020-05-21T18:00:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f46f2c30d9862290af025bf3bbd07f7c374417a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWith SPARK-18107, we will disable the underlying replace(overwrite) and instead do delete in spark side and only do copy in hive side to bypass the performance issue - [HIVE-11940](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11940)\r\n\r\nConditionally, if the table location and partition location do not belong to the same `FileSystem`, We should not disable hive overwrite. Otherwise, hive will use the `FileSystem` instance belong to the table location to copy files, which will fail in `FileSystem#checkPath`\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/rel/release-2.3.7/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/metadata/Hive.java#L1657\r\n\r\nIn this PR, for Hive 2.0.0 and onwards, as [HIVE-11940](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-11940) has been fixed, and there is no performance issue anymore. We should leave the overwrite logic to hive to avoid failure in `FileSystem#checkPath`\r\n\r\n**NOTE THAT**  For Hive 2.2.0 and earlier, if the table and partition locations do not belong together, we will still get the same error thrown by hive encryption check due to  [HIVE-14380]( https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-14380) which need to fix in another ticket SPARK-31675.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nbugfix. a logic table can be decoupled with the storage layer and may contain data from remote storage systems.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCurrently verified manually. add benchmark tests\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-INSERT INTO DYNAMIC                                7742           7918

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update Prometheus-related output format to be consistent with DropWizard 4.1 result.\r\n- Add `Number` metrics for gauges metrics.\r\n- Add `type` labels.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSPARK-29032 added Prometheus support. After that, SPARK-29674 upgraded DropWizard for JDK9+ support and this caused difference in output labels and number of keys for Guage metrics. The current status is different from Apache Spark 2.4.5. Since we cannot change DropWizard, this PR aims to be consistent in Apache Spark 3.0.0 only.\r\n\r\n**DropWizard 3.x**\r\n```\r\nmetrics_master_aliveWorkers_Value 1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n**DropWizard 4.1**\r\n```\r\nmetrics_master_aliveWorkers_Value{type=\"gauges\",} 1.0\r\nmetrics_master_aliveWorkers_Number{type=\"gauges\",} 1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but this is a new feature in 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually check the output like the following.\r\n\r\n**JMXExporter Result**\r\n```\r\n$ curl -s http://localhost:8088/ | grep \"^metrics_master\" | sort\r\nmetrics_master_aliveWorkers_Number{type=\"gauges\",} 1.0\r\nmetrics_master_aliveWorkers_Value{type=\"gauges\",}

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen I was finding the root cause for SPARK-31675, I noticed that it was very difficult for me to see what was actually going on, since it output nothing else but only\r\n```sql\r\nError in query: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Wrong FS: blablah/.hive-staging_blahbla, expected: hdfs://cluster1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is really hard for us to find causes through such a simple error message without a certain amount of experience.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose to print all of the stack traces when AnalysisException occurs if there are underlying root causes, also we can escape this via `-S` option.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-11188,\r\n\r\n>For analysis exceptions in the sql-shell, we should only print the error message to the screen. The stacktrace will never have useful information since this error is used to signify an error with the query.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut nowadays, some `AnalysisException`s do have useful information for us to debug, e.g. the `AnalysisException` below may contain exceptions from hive or Hadoop side.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/a28ed86a387b286745b30cd4d90b3d558205a5a7/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveExternalCatalog.scala#L97-L112\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n\tat

user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n#### Manually test:\r\n\r\n~~~scala\r\nimport scala.util.Random\r\nval rng = new Random(3)\r\n\r\nval a1 = Array.tabulate(200)(_=>rng.nextDouble * 2.0 - 1.0) ++ Array.fill(20)(0.0) ++ Array.fill(20)(-0.0)\r\n\r\nimport spark.implicits._\r\nval df1 = sc.parallelize(a1, 2).toDF(\"id\")\r\n\r\nimport

This break the contract between equals() and hashCode() If two objects are equal, then they must have the same hash code.\r\n\r\nAnd array.distinct will rely on elem.hashCode so it leads to this error.\r\n\r\nTest code on distinct\r\n```\r\nimport scala.util.Random\r\nval rng = new Random(3)\r\n\r\nval a1 = Array.tabulate(200)(_=>rng.nextDouble * 2.0 - 1.0) ++ Array.fill(20)(0.0) ++

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nInstead of using `child.output` directly, we should use `inputAggBufferAttributes` from the current agg expression  for `Final` and `PartialMerge` aggregates to bind references for their `mergeExpression`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen planning aggregates, the partial aggregate uses agg fucs' `inputAggBufferAttributes` as its output, see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.0.0-rc1/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/aggregate/AggUtils.scala#L105\r\n\r\nFor final `HashAggregateExec`, we need to bind the `DeclarativeAggregate.mergeExpressions` with the output of the partial aggregate operator, see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.0.0-rc1/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/aggregate/HashAggregateExec.scala#L348\r\n\r\nThis is usually fine. However, if we copy the agg func somehow after agg planning, like `PlanSubqueries`, the `DeclarativeAggregate` will be replaced by a new instance with new `inputAggBufferAttributes` and `mergeExpressions`. Then we can't bind the `mergeExpressions` with the output of the partial aggregate operator, as it uses the `inputAggBufferAttributes` of the original `DeclarativeAggregate` before copy.\r\n\r\nNote that, `ImperativeAggregate` doesn't have this problem, as we don't need to bind its `mergeExpressions`. It has a different mechanism to access buffer values, via `mutableAggBufferOffset` and `inputAggBufferOffset`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, user hit error previously but run query successfully after this change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to new Prometheus-format metric endpoints experimental in Apache Spark 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough the new metrics are disabled by default, we had better make it experimental explicitly in Apache Spark 3.0.0 since the output format is still not fixed. We can finalize it in Apache Spark 3.1.0.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nOnly doc-change is visible to the users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually check the code since this is a documentation and class annotation

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTests to ensure interoperability with [Avro4s](https://github.com/sksamuel/avro4s).\r\nThese tests check, that Avro records generated by Avro4s can be successfully deserealized to Spark SQL records.\r\n\r\nAvro4s version 2.0.4 is used - the latest version compatible with Avro 1.8 (used by Spark).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAvro4s is a popular library to make conversions between Avro records and Scala case classes.\r\nI faced the issue with ClassCastException https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-30267 when using Avro records generated by Avro4s.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests: Avro4sInteroperSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-10T16:21:24Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T00:20:54Z","closed_at":"2020-08-31T00:20:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"165089bf366cdfb73042eef877923dfc97915a86","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28491/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28491/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28491/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90155a228afed698c6dea414d99eda05a3f738bd","head":{"label":"tashoyan:SPARK-30267-ClassCastException","ref":"SPARK-30267-ClassCastException","sha":"90155a228afed698c6dea414d99eda05a3f738bd","user":{"login":"tashoyan","id":17761745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzYxNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17761745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan","html_url":"https://github.com/tashoyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":262781717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI3ODE3MTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"tashoyan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tashoyan","id":17761745,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzYxNzQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17761745?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan","html_url":"https://github.com/tashoyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tashoyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tashoyan/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModified the `decodeDictionaryIds()` method of `VectorizedColumnReader` to handle especially `TimestampType` when the passed parameter `rebaseDateTime` is true. In that case, decoded milliseconds/microseconds are rebased from the hybrid calendar to Proleptic Gregorian calendar using `RebaseDateTime`.`rebaseJulianToGregorianMicros()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the bug of loading timestamps before the cutover day from dictionary encoded column in parquet files. The code below forces dictionary encoding:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.rebaseDateTimeInWrite.enabled\", true)\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.parquet.outputTimestampType\", \"TIMESTAMP_MICROS\")\r\nscala>\r\nSeq.tabulate(8)(_ => \"1001-01-01 01:02:03.123\").toDF(\"tsS\")\r\n  .select($\"tsS\".cast(\"timestamp\").as(\"ts\")).repartition(1)\r\n  .write\r\n  .option(\"parquet.enable.dictionary\", true)\r\n  .parquet(path)\r\n```\r\nLoad the dates back:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(path).show(false)\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n|ts                     |\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n|1001-01-07 00:32:20.123|\r\n...\r\n|1001-01-07 00:32:20.123|\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n```\r\nExpected values **must be 1001-01-01 01:02:03.123** but not 1001-01-07 00:32:20.123.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(path).show(false)\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n|ts                     |\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n|1001-01-01 01:02:03.123|\r\n...\r\n|1001-01-01 01:02:03.123|\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified the test `SPARK-31159: rebasing timestamps in write` in `ParquetIOSuite` to checked reading dictionary encoded dates.","created_at":"2020-05-10T11:50:31Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:49:14Z","closed_at":"2020-05-11T04:58:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43aa659fe60ce86d4d05a953d3203a3b782125e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28489/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28489/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28489/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06dc7851575e8e7a316384766b6197a444e24172","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-ts-rebase-parquet-dict-enc","ref":"fix-ts-rebase-parquet-dict-enc","sha":"06dc7851575e8e7a316384766b6197a444e24172","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen input column lengths can not be inferred and handleInvalid = \"keep\",  VectorAssembler will throw a runtime exception. However the error message with this exception is not consistent. I change the content of this error message to make it work properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is a bug. Here is a simple example to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// create a df without vector size\r\nval df = Seq(\r\n  (Vectors.dense(1.0), Vectors.dense(2.0))\r\n).toDF(\"n1\", \"n2\")\r\n\r\n// only set vector size hint for n1 column\r\nval hintedDf = new VectorSizeHint()\r\n  .setInputCol(\"n1\")\r\n  .setSize(1)\r\n  .transform(df)\r\n\r\n// assemble n1, n2\r\nval output = new VectorAssembler()\r\n  .setInputCols(Array(\"n1\", \"n2\"))\r\n  .setOutputCol(\"features\")\r\n  .setHandleInvalid(\"keep\")\r\n  .transform(hintedDf)\r\n\r\n// because only n1 has vector size, the error message should tell us to set vector size for n2 too\r\noutput.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCan not infer column lengths with handleInvalid = \"keep\". Consider using VectorSizeHint to add metadata for columns: [n2].\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCan not infer column lengths with handleInvalid = \"keep\". Consider using VectorSizeHint to add metadata for columns: [n1, n2].\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis introduce difficulties when I try to resolve this exception, for I do not know which column required vectorSizeHint. This is especially troublesome when you have a large number of columns to deal with.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd test in VectorAssemblerSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-09T19:35:47Z","updated_at":"2020-05-11T23:24:10Z","closed_at":"2020-05-11T23:23:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f4fe510ce75c6bc8900e2853d7cd1fe9918cb39","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28487/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28487/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28487/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f3fa686ed00e346234c3f93c42333020fdd64c69","head":{"label":"fan31415:SPARK-31671","ref":"SPARK-31671","sha":"f3fa686ed00e346234c3f93c42333020fdd64c69","user":{"login":"fan31415","id":13296486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjk2NDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13296486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415","html_url":"https://github.com/fan31415","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":262628246,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI2MjgyNDY=","name":"spark","full_name":"fan31415/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fan31415","id":13296486,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMjk2NDg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13296486?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415","html_url":"https://github.com/fan31415","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fan31415/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fan31415/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nShift non-existing dates in Proleptic Gregorian calendar by 1 day. The reason for that is `RowEncoderSuite` generates random dates/timestamps in the hybrid calendar, and some dates/timestamps don't exist in Proleptic Gregorian calendar like 1000-02-29 because 1000 is not leap year in Proleptic Gregorian calendar.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis makes RowEncoderSuite much stable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running RowEncoderSuite and set non-existing date manually:\r\n```scala\r\nval date = new java.sql.Date(1000 - 1900, 1, 29)\r\nTry { date.toLocalDate; date }.getOrElse(new Date(date.getTime +

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd Pagination Support for structured streaming page. Now both tables `Active Queries` and `Completed Queries` will have pagination. \r\nTo implement pagination, pagination framework from #7399  is used.\r\n* Also tables will only be shown if there is at least one entry in the table.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n* This will help users in analysing their structured streaming queries in much better way.\r\n* Other Web UI pages support pagination in their table. So this will make web UI more consistent across pages.\r\n* This can prevent potential OOM errors.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. Both tables will support pagination.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n**Before Changes:**\r\n<img width=\"1677\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-05-28 at 12 01 49 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15366835/83060758-9769c600-a079-11ea-9e68-290af430bd80.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n**After Changes:**\r\n<img width=\"1677\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-05-28 at 12 22 28 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15366835/83060920-d1d36300-a079-11ea-8ff9-b12cf729b874.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

PR is based on top of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28370\r\nWhat changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter changes in SPARK-20628, CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend can decommission an executor and stop assigning new tasks on it. We should also decommission the corresponding blockmanagers in the same way. i.e. Move the cached RDD blocks from those executors to other active executors.\r\n\r\nWhy are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to gracefully decommission the block managers so that the underlying RDD cache blocks are not lost in case the executors are taken away forcefully after some timeout (because of spotloss/pre-emptible VM etc). Its good to save as much cache data as possible.\r\n\r\nAlso In future once the decommissioning signal comes from Cluster Manager (say YARN/Mesos etc), dynamic allocation + this change gives us opportunity to downscale the executors faster by making the executors free of cache data.\r\n\r\nNote that this is a best effort approach. We try to move cache blocks from decommissioning executors to active executors. If the active executors don't have free resources available on them for caching, then the decommissioning executors will keep the cache block which it was not able to move and it will still be able to serve them.\r\n\r\nCurrent overall Flow:\r\n\r\nCoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend receives a signal to decommissionExecutor. On receiving the signal, it do 2 things - Stop assigning new tasks (SPARK-20628), Send another message to BlockManagerMasterEndpoint (via BlockManagerMaster) to decommission the corresponding BlockManager.\r\n\r\nBlockManagerMasterEndpoint receives \"DecommissionBlockManagers\" message. On receiving this, it moves the corresponding block managers to \"decommissioning\" state. All decommissioning BMs are excluded from the getPeers RPC call which is used for replication. All these decommissioning BMs are also sent message from BlockManagerMasterEndpoint to start decommissioning process on themselves.\r\n\r\nBlockManager on worker (say BM-x) receives the \"DecommissionBlockManager\" message. Now it will start BlockManagerDecommissionManager thread to offload all the RDD cached blocks. This thread can make multiple reattempts to decommission the existing cache blocks (multiple reattempts might be needed as there might not be sufficient space in other active BMs initially).\r\n\r\nDoes this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\nHow was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModified `RandomDataGenerator.forType` for DateType and TimestampType to generate special date//timestamp values with 0.5 probability. This will trigger dictionary encoding in Parquet datasource test  HadoopFsRelationTest \"test all data types\". Currently, dictionary encoding is tested only for numeric types like ShortType.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo extend test coverage. Currently, probability of testing of dictionary encoding in the test HadoopFsRelationTest \"test all data types\" for DateType and TimestampType is close to zero because dates/timestamps are uniformly distributed in wide range, and the chance of generating the same values is pretty low. In this way, parquet datasource cannot apply dictionary encoding for such column types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running `ParquetHadoopFsRelationSuite` and `JsonHadoopFsRelationSuite`.","created_at":"2020-05-08T18:56:54Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:49:18Z","closed_at":"2020-05-11T12:59:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"33ced86830ba13f1b9cb5d4f51200a2e58c03dfc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28481/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28481/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28481/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a78e18b2631ed29703e4791cc850d62e3c58faaa","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:test-random-parquet-dict-enc","ref":"test-random-parquet-dict-enc","sha":"a78e18b2631ed29703e4791cc850d62e3c58faaa","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRight now the communication mechanism between executor and driver when launching executor is:\r\n\r\n1. executor backend sends \"RegisterExecutor\" to the driver backend.\r\n2. the driver backend replies \"true\".\r\n3. executor backend instantiates executor once it receives \"true\" from driver backend.\r\n4. after the executor is instantiated, the executor backend sends \"LaunchedExecutor\"(introduced in PR#25964) to the driver backend.\r\n5. the driver backend makes offers for executor when received \"LaunchedExecutor\".\r\n\r\nA race can occur in steps 3 and 4. If the driver backend is stopped(hence driver endpoint removed in dispatcher) during step 3, in step 4, when executor backend tries to send \"LaunchedExecutor\" to driver backend, RPC dispatcher will throw an uncaught SparkException for \"Could not find CoarseGrainedScheduler\".  These exception logs are verbose and somewhat misleading.\r\n\r\nThis PR is trying to fix this issue through these changes:\r\nWhen the CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend#stop() is called:\r\n\r\n- A stopping boolean variable is set to true.\r\n- driverEndpoint will not be stopped at this time. (dispatcher will stop it at the end)\r\n\r\nAnd when the stopping is set to true, the driver backend will:\r\n\r\n- replies sendFailure to executor backend when receives \"RegisterExecutor\".\r\n- replies \"StopExecutor\" to executor backend (or \"RemoveExecutor\" to self) when receives \"LaunchedExecutor\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is a race between executor backend and scheduler backend.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRe-run with the same command in a YARN cluster multiple times and didn't see the issue happen again.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModified the `decodeDictionaryIds()` method of `VectorizedColumnReader` to handle especially the `DateType` when passed parameter `rebaseDateTime` is true. In that case, decoded days are rebased from the hybrid calendar to Proleptic Gregorian calendar using `RebaseDateTime`.`rebaseJulianToGregorianDays()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis fixes the bug of loading dates before the cutover day from dictionary encoded column in parquet files. The code below forces dictionary encoding:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.rebaseDateTimeInWrite.enabled\", true)\r\nSeq.tabulate(8)(_ => \"1001-01-01\").toDF(\"dateS\")\r\n  .select($\"dateS\".cast(\"date\").as(\"date\")).repartition(1)\r\n  .write\r\n  .option(\"parquet.enable.dictionary\", true)\r\n  .parquet(path)\r\n```\r\nLoad the dates back:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).show(false)\r\n+----------+\r\n|date      |\r\n+----------+\r\n|1001-01-07|\r\n...\r\n|1001-01-07|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\nExpected values **must be 1000-01-01** but not 1001-01-07.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.parquet(path).show(false)\r\n+----------+\r\n|date      |\r\n+----------+\r\n|1001-01-01|\r\n...\r\n|1001-01-01|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified the test `SPARK-31159: rebasing dates in write` in `ParquetIOSuite` to checked reading dictionary encoded dates.","created_at":"2020-05-08T12:17:55Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:49:10Z","closed_at":"2020-05-10T04:31:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6342ad6ea898252e8c5556f5396bc8b05df2810","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28479/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28479/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28479/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0a560b916c209d269b4d7efd6b3ae40534f4a5b3","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:fix-datetime-rebase-parquet-dict-enc","ref":"fix-datetime-rebase-parquet-dict-enc","sha":"0a560b916c209d269b4d7efd6b3ae40534f4a5b3","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nShow write commands on SQL UI of an AQE plan\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently the leaf node of an AQE plan is always a `AdaptiveSparkPlan` which is not true when it's a child of a write command. Hence, the node of the write command as well as its metrics are not shown on the SQL UI.\r\n\r\n####

write\r\n\r\nto check non-vectorized Parquet reader together with vectorized reader.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve test coverage and make sure that non-vectorized reader behaves similar to the vectorized reader.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running `PaquetIOSuite`:\r\n```\r\n$ ./build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis changes the docs to make it clearer that order preservation is not guaranteed when saving a RDD to disk and reading it back ([SPARK-5300](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-5300)).\r\n\r\nI added two sentences about this in the RDD Programming Guide.\r\n\r\nThe issue was discussed on the dev mailing list:\r\nhttp://apache-spark-developers-list.1001551.n3.nabble.com/RDD-order-guarantees-td10142.html\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause RDDs are order-aware collections, it is natural to expect that if I use `saveAsTextFile` and then load the resulting file with `sparkContext.textFile`, I obtain a RDD in the same order.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunately not the case at the moment and there is no agreed upon way to fix this in Spark itself (see PR #4204 which attempted to fix this). Users should be aware of this.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, two new sentences in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy checking that the documentation looks good.","created_at":"2020-05-06T16:42:18Z","updated_at":"2020-07-04T15:20:40Z","closed_at":"2020-05-12T13:27:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b758e87a3fac4adf4b2598ed40fb0a8e449c80d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28465/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28465/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28465/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/da7f285a45901e95eb1f9836f0e3c4847c690bf3","head":{"label":"wetneb:SPARK-5300-docs","ref":"SPARK-5300-docs","sha":"da7f285a45901e95eb1f9836f0e3c4847c690bf3","user":{"login":"wetneb","id":309908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTkwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb","html_url":"https://github.com/wetneb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":257779670,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTc3Nzk2NzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"wetneb/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wetneb","id":309908,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwOTkwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/309908?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb","html_url":"https://github.com/wetneb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wetneb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wetneb/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to enhance Spark's `ClosureCleaner` to support \"indylambda\" style of Scala closures to the same level as the existing implementation for the old (inner class) style ones. The goal is to reach feature parity with the support of the old style Scala closures, with as close to bug-for-bug compatibility as possible.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this PR addresses one lacking support for indylambda closures vs the inner class closures:\r\n- When a closure is declared in a Scala REPL and captures the enclosing REPL line object, such closure should be cleanable (unreferenced fields on the enclosing REPL line object should be cleaned)\r\n\r\nThis PR maintains the same limitations in the new indylambda closure support as the old inner class closures, in particular the following two:\r\n- Cleaning is only available for one level of REPL line object. If a closure captures state from a REPL line object further out from the immediate enclosing one, it won't be subject to cleaning. See example below.\r\n- \"Sibling\" closures are not handled yet. A \"sibling\" closure is defined here as a closure that is directly or indirectly referenced by the starting closure, but isn't lexically enclosing. e.g.\r\n  ```scala\r\n  {\r\n    val siblingClosure = (x: Int) => x + this.fieldA   // captures `this`, references `fieldA` on `this`.\r\n    val startingClosure = (y: Int) => y + this.fieldB + siblingClosure(y)  // captures `this` and `siblingClosure`, references `fieldB` on `this`.\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nThe changes are intended to be minimal, with further code cleanups planned in separate PRs.\r\n\r\nJargons:\r\n- old, inner class style Scala closures, aka `delambdafy:inline`: default in Scala 2.11 and before\r\n- new, \"indylambda\" style Scala closures, aka `delambdafy:method`: default in Scala 2.12 and later\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere had been previous effortsto extend Spark's `ClosureCleaner` to support \"indylambda\" Scala closures, which is necessary for proper Scala 2.12 support. Most notably the work done for [SPARK-14540](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14540).\r\n\r\nBut the previous efforts had missed one import scenario: a Scala closure declared in a Scala REPL, and it captures the enclosing `this` -- a REPL line object. e.g. in a Spark Shell:\r\n```scala\r\n:pa\r\nclass NotSerializableClass(val x: Int)\r\nval ns = new NotSerializableClass(42)\r\nval topLevelValue = \"someValue\"\r\nval func = (j: Int) => {\r\n  (1 to j).flatMap { x =>\r\n    (1 to x).map { y => y + topLevelValue }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n<Ctrl+D>\r\nsc.parallelize(0 to 2).map(func).collect\r\n```\r\nIn this example, `func` refers to a Scala closure that captures the enclosing `this` because it needs to access `topLevelValue`, which is in turn implemented as a field on the enclosing REPL line object.\r\n\r\nThe existing `ClosureCleaner` in Spark supports cleaning this case in Scala 2.11-, and this PR brings feature parity to Scala 2.12+.\r\n\r\nNote that the existing cleaning logic only supported one level of REPL line object nesting. This PR does not go beyond that. When a closure references state declared a few commands earlier, the cleaning will fail in both Scala 2.11 and Scala 2.12. e.g.\r\n```scala\r\nscala> :pa\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\nclass NotSerializableClass1(val x: Int)\r\ncase class Foo(id: String)\r\nval ns = new NotSerializableClass1(42)\r\nval topLevelValue = \"someValue\"\r\n\r\n// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.\r\n\r\ndefined class NotSerializableClass1\r\ndefined class Foo\r\nns: NotSerializableClass1 = NotSerializableClass1@615b1baf\r\ntopLevelValue: String = someValue\r\n\r\nscala> :pa\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\nval closure2 = (j: Int) => {\r\n  (1 to j).flatMap { x =>\r\n    (1 to x).map { y => y + topLevelValue } // 2 levels\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.\r\n\r\nclosure2: Int => scala.collection.immutable.IndexedSeq[String] = <function1>\r\n\r\nscala> sc.parallelize(0 to 2).map(closure2).collect\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Task not serializable\r\n...\r\n```\r\nin the Scala 2.11 / Spark 2.4.x case:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.NotSerializableException: NotSerializableClass1\r\nSerialization stack:\r\n\t- object not serializable (class: NotSerializableClass1, value: NotSerializableClass1@615b1baf)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: ns, type: class NotSerializableClass1)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@64df3f4b)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $iw, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@66e6e5e9)\r\n\t- field (class: $line14.$read, name: $iw, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $line14.$read, $line14.$read@c310aa3)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $line14$read, type: class $line14.$read)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@79224636)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $outer, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@636d4cdc)\r\n\t- field (class: $anonfun$1, name: $outer, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $anonfun$1, <function1>)\r\n```\r\nin the Scala 2.12 / Spark master case after this PR:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.io.NotSerializableException: NotSerializableClass1\r\nSerialization stack:\r\n\t- object not serializable (class: NotSerializableClass1, value: NotSerializableClass1@6f3b4c9a)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: ns, type: class NotSerializableClass1)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@2945a3c1)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $iw, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@152705d0)\r\n\t- field (class: $line14.$read, name: $iw, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $line14.$read, $line14.$read@7cf311eb)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $line14$read, type: class $line14.$read)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@d980dac)\r\n\t- field (class: $iw, name: $outer, type: class $iw)\r\n\t- object (class $iw, $iw@557d9532)\r\n\t- element of array (index: 0)\r\n\t- array (class [Ljava.lang.Object;, size 1)\r\n\t- field (class: java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda, name: capturedArgs, type: class [Ljava.lang.Object;)\r\n\t- object (class java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda, SerializedLambda[capturingClass=class $iw, functionalInterfaceMethod=scala/Function1.apply:(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;, implementation=invokeStatic $anonfun$closure2$1$adapted:(L$iw;Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/collection/immutable/IndexedSeq;, instantiatedMethodType=(Ljava/lang/Object;)Lscala/collection/immutable/IndexedSeq;, numCaptured=1])\r\n\t- writeReplace data (class: java.lang.invoke.SerializedLambda)\r\n\t- object (class $Lambda$2103/815179920, $Lambda$2103/815179920@569b57c4)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more background of the new and old ways Scala lowers closures to Java bytecode, please see [A note on how NSC (New Scala Compiler) lowers lambdas](https://gist.github.com/rednaxelafx/e9ecd09bbd1c448dbddad4f4edf25d48#file-notes-md).\r\n\r\nFor more background on how Spark's `ClosureCleaner` works and what's needed to make it support \"indylambda\" Scala closures, please refer to [A Note on Apache Spark's ClosureCleaner](https://gist.github.com/rednaxelafx/e9ecd09bbd1c448dbddad4f4edf25d48#file-spark_closurecleaner_notes-md).\r\n\r\n#### tl;dr\r\n\r\nThe `ClosureCleaner` works like a mark-sweep algorithm on fields:\r\n- Finding (a chain of) outer objects referenced by the starting closure;\r\n- Scanning the starting closure and its inner closures and marking the fields on the outer objects accessed;\r\n- Cloning the outer objects, nulling out fields that are not accessed by any closure of concern.\r\n\r\n##### Outer Objects\r\n\r\nFor the old, inner class style Scala closures, the \"outer objects\" is defined as the lexically enclosing closures of the starting closure, plus an optional enclosing REPL line object if these closures are defined in a Scala REPL. All of them are on a singly-linked `$outer` chain.\r\n\r\nFor the new, \"indylambda\" style Scala closures, the capturing implementation changed, so closures no longer refer to their enclosing closures via an `$outer` chain. However, a closure can still capture its enclosing REPL line object, much like the old style closures. The name of the field that captures this reference would be `arg$1` (instead of `$outer`).\r\n\r\nSo what's missing in the `ClosureCleaner` for the \"indylambda\" support is find and potentially clone+clean the captured enclosing `this` REPL line object. That's what this PR implements.\r\n\r\n##### Inner Closures\r\n\r\nThe old, inner class style of Scala closures are compiled into separate inner classes, one per lambda body. So in order to discover the implementation (bytecode) of the inner closures, one has to jump over multiple classes. The name of such a class would contain the marker substring `$anonfun$`.\r\n\r\nThe new, \"indylambda\" style Scala closures are compiled into **static methods** in the class where the lambdas were declared. So for lexically nested closures, their lambda bodies would all be compiled into static methods **in the same class**. This makes it much easier to discover the implementation (bytecode) of the nested lambda bodies. The name of such a static method would contain the marker substring `$anonfun$`.\r\n\r\nDiscovery of inner closures involves scanning bytecode for certain patterns that represent the creation of a closure object for the inner closure.\r\n- For inner class style: the closure object creation site is like `new <InnerClassForTheClosure>(captured args)`\r\n- For \"indylambda\" style: the closure object creation site would be compiled into an `invokedynamic` instruction, with its \"bootstrap method\" pointing to the same one used by Java 8 for its serializable lambdas, and with the bootstrap method arguments pointing to the implementation method.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Before this PR, Spark 2.4 / 3.0 / master on Scala 2.12 would not support Scala closures declared in a Scala REPL that captures anything from the REPL line objects. After this PR, such scenario is supported.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test case to `org.apache.spark.repl.SingletonReplSuite`. The new test case fails without the fix in this PR, and pases with the fix.","created_at":"2020-05-06T11:49:13Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T02:47:26Z","closed_at":"2020-05-18T05:33:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"993f3e1c0fbf65dfabe0f367827f3839a38c588d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406628559,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI4NTU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20SHELL","name":"SPARK

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR improves handling the case where different barrier sync types in a single sync:\r\n\r\n- use `clear` instead of `cleanupBarrierStage `\r\n\r\n- make sure all requesters are failed because of \"different barrier sync types\"\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, we use `cleanupBarrierStage` to clean up a barrier stage when we detecting the case of \"different barrier sync types\". But this leads to a problem that we could create new a `ContextBarrierState` for the same stage again if there're on-way requests from tasks. As a result, those task will fail because of killing instead of \"different barrier sync types\".\r\n\r\nBesides, we don't handle the current request which is being handling properly as it will fail due to epoch mismatch instead of \"different barrier sync types\".\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUpdated a existed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to deprecate 'spark.sql.optimizer.metadataOnly' configuration and remove it in the future release.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis optimization can cause a potential correctness issue, see also SPARK-26709.\r\nAlso, it seems difficult to extend the optimization. Basically you should whitelist all available functions. It costs some maintenance overhead, see also SPARK-31590.\r\n\r\nLooks we should just better let users use `SparkSessionExtensions` instead if they must use, and remove it in Spark side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, setting `spark.sql.optimizer.metadataOnly` will show a deprecation warning:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.unset(\"spark.sql.optimizer.metadataOnly\")\r\n```\r\n```\r\n20/05/06 12:57:23 WARN SQLConf: The SQL config 'spark.sql.optimizer.metadataOnly' has been\r\n deprecated in Spark v3.0 and may be removed in the future. Avoid to depend on this optimization\r\n to prevent a potential correctness issue. If you must use, use 'SparkSessionExtensions' instead to \r\ninject it as a custom rule.\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.optimizer.metadataOnly\", \"true\")\r\n```\r\n```\r\n20/05/06 12:57:44 WARN SQLConf: The SQL config 'spark.sql.optimizer.metadataOnly' has been \r\ndeprecated in Spark v3.0 and may be removed in the future. Avoid to depend on this optimization\r\n to prevent a potential correctness issue. If you must use, use 'SparkSessionExtensions' instead to \r\ninject it as a custom rule.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1, reorg the `fit` method in LR to several blocks (`createModel`, `createBounds`, `createOptimizer`, `createInitCoefWithInterceptMatrix`);\r\n2, add new param blockSize;\r\n3, if blockSize==1, keep original behavior, code path `trainOnRows`; \r\n4, if blockSize>1, standardize and stack input vectors to blocks (like ALS/MLP), code path `trainOnBlocks`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOn dense dataset `epsilon_normalized.t`:\r\n1, reduce RAM to persist traing dataset; (save about 40% RAM)\r\n2, use Level-2 BLAS routines; (4x ~ 5x faster)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new param is added\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting and added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove unused `registeredConnections` counter from `ExternalBlockHandler#ShuffleMetrics`\r\n\r\nThis was added by SPARK-25642 at 3.0.0\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/8dd29fe36b781d115213b1d6a8446ad04e9239bb\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt's `registeredConnections` counter created in `TransportContext` that's really counting the numbers and it's misleading for people who want to add new metrics like `registeredConnections`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd UTs to ensure all expected metrics are registered for `ExternalShuffleService` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds the maven property guava.version which can be\r\nused to control the guava version for a build.\r\n\r\nIt does not change the current version.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAll future Hadoop releases are going to be built with a later guava version, including Hadoop 3.1.4. This means to run the spark tests with that release you need to update the spark guava version. This patch lets whoever builds spark do this locally.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nran the hadoop-cloud module

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPerform days rebasing while converting days from JSON string field. In Spark 2.4 and earlier versions, the days are interpreted as days since the epoch in the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian since 1582-10-15). Since Spark 3.0, the base calendar was switched to Proleptic Gregorian calendar, so, the days should be rebased to represent the same local date.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix a bug and restore compatibility with Spark 2.4 in which:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"d date\").json(Seq(\"{'d': '-141704'}\").toDS).show\r\n+----------+\r\n|         d|\r\n+----------+\r\n|1582-01-01|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"d date\").json(Seq(\"{'d': '-141704'}\").toDS).show\r\n+----------+\r\n|         d|\r\n+----------+\r\n|1582-01-11|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.schema(\"d date\").json(Seq(\"{'d': '-141704'}\").toDS).show\r\n+----------+\r\n|         d|\r\n+----------+\r\n|1582-01-01|\r\n+----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a test to `JsonSuite`.","created_at":"2020-05-05T09:12:54Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:48:53Z","closed_at":"2020-05-05T14:15:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c877f0d36419bf34d1cd3d797213cba524543c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/28453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/28453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/03d9d3341339ccdb59fdef0247f8e15d063b4715","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:json-rebase-legacy-days","ref":"json-rebase-legacy-days","sha":"03d9d3341339ccdb59fdef0247f8e15d063b4715","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis reverts commit https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/43a73e387cb843486adcf5b8bbd8b99010ce6e02. It sets `INT96` as the timestamp type while saving timestamps to parquet files.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo be compatible with Hive and Presto that don't support the `TIMESTAMP_MICROS` type in current stable releases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade SLF4J from 1.7.16 to 1.7.30.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSLF4J 1.7.23+ is required to enable `slf4j-log4j12` with MDC feature to run under Java 9. Also, this will bring all latest bug fixes.\r\n- http://www.slf4j.org/news.html\r\n\r\n> When running under Java 9, log4j version 1.2.x is unable to correctly parse the \"java.version\" system property. Assuming an inccorect Java version, it proceeded to disable its MDC functionality. The slf4j-log4j12 module shipping in this release fixes the issue by tweaking MDC internals by reflection, allowing log4j to run under Java 9. See also SLF4J-393.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins with the existing
