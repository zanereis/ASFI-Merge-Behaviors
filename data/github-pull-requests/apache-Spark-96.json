for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSparkSession created by newSession should not share the channel. This is because that a SparkSession might be called `stop` in which the channel it uses will be shutdown. If the channel is shared, other non-stop SparkSession that is sharing this channel will get into trouble.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes the issue when one SparkSession is stopped to cause other active SparkSession not working in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

`-PScala-2.13`\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\nStart spark connect with default settings: \r\n* `./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-shell` \r\n* or `./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect` (Enter \"q\" <new line> to exit the program)\r\n\r\nStart Scala client with default settings: `./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client`\r\n\r\nStart spark connect with extra configs:\r\n* `./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-shell --conf spark.connect.grpc.binding.port=8888`\r\n* or `./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect --conf spark.connect.grpc.binding.port=8888`\r\n\r\nStart Scala

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs of now that Connect Python client cache the schema when calling `def schema()`. However this might cause stale data issue. For example:\r\n```\r\n1. Create table\r\n2. table.schema\r\n3. drop table and recreate the table with different schema\r\n4. table.schema // now this is incorrect\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  5. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix the behavior when the cached schema could be stale.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThis is actually a fix that users now can always see the most up-to-dated schema.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new function `try_aes_decrypt()` which binds to new expression `TryAesDecrypt` that is a runtime replaceable expression of the combination of `TryEval` and `AesDecrypt`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes improve user experience with Spark SQL. The existing function `aes_decrypt()` fails w/ an exception as soon as it faces to some invalid input that cannot be decrypted, and the rest (even if the values can be decrypted) is ignored. New function returns `NULL` on bad inputs and decrypts other values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. This PR just extends existing API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.ExpressionInfoSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly

(conceptually).\r\n\r\nThis logic is pushed into MapOutputTracker though - and getPreferredLocationsForShuffle honors spark.shuffle.reduceLocality.enabled - but getMapLocation does not.\r\n\r\nSo the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nI've convert internal typing symbols in `__init__.py` to private. When these changes are agreed upon, I can expand this MR with more `TypeVar` this applies to.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEditors consider all public symbols in a library importable. A common pattern is to use a shorthand for pyspark functions:\r\n```python\r\nimport pyspark.sql.functions as F\r\nF.col(...)\r\n```\r\nSince `pyspark.F` is a valid symbol according to `__init__.py`, editors will suggest this to users, while it is not a valid use-case of pyspark.\r\n\r\nThis change is in line with Pyright's [Typing Guidance for Python Libraries](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/typed-libraries.md#generic-classes-and-functions)\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nVerified with PyCharm auto-importing.","created_at":"2023-03-08T12:53:29Z","updated_at":"2023-03-15T12:25:28Z","closed_at":"2023-03-15T11:38:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc81434f4a282e57e8e3ffc1795390272c36934d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1fe03bc30bebb70302030dbc7c7bc10ad7f1cf74","head":{"label":"MaicoTimmerman:master","ref":"master","sha":"1fe03bc30bebb70302030dbc7c7bc10ad7f1cf74","user":{"login":"MaicoTimmerman","id":904824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDgyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/904824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman","html_url":"https://github.com/MaicoTimmerman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":611161787,"node_id":"R_kgDOJG2Wuw","name":"spark","full_name":"MaicoTimmerman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaicoTimmerman","id":904824,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkwNDgyNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/904824?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman","html_url":"https://github.com/MaicoTimmerman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaicoTimmerman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaicoTimmerman/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nA `DataSourceV2` reporting a `KeyGroupedPartitioning` through `SupportsReportPartitioning` does not have to implement `HasPartitionKey`, and is thus not limited to a single key per partition.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore Spark 3.3, `DataSourceV2` implementations could report a `ClusteredDistribution` with more than just a single cluster value per partition. This allowed Spark to exploit the existing partitioning and avoid an extra hash partitioning shuffle step. Transformations like `groupBy` or window functions (with the right group / partitioning keys) would then be executed on the partitioning provided by the data source.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis improves performance as existing partitioning is reused.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests have been fixed. They falsely reported partitions with multiple keys via `HasPartitionKey`.","created_at":"2023-03-08T11:20:37Z","updated_at":"2023-10-10T00:17:31Z","closed_at":"2023-10-10T00:17:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c9b13d227bb0893ffca71505382f12200e9d6c4f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40334/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40334/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40334/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9218f380aee9933aa178b93738cdd307c985ad1d","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-key-grouped-partitioning-wo-haskey","ref":"branch-key-grouped-partitioning-wo-haskey","sha":"9218f380aee9933aa178b93738cdd307c985ad1d","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the parent directory in `shell.py` execution when IPython is used. \r\n\r\nThis is a general issue for PySpark shell specifically with IPython - IPython temporarily adds the parent directory of the script into the Python path (`sys.path`), which results in searching packages under `pyspark` directory. For example, `import pandas` attempts to import `pyspark.pandas`.\r\n\r\nSo far, we haven't had such cases within PySpark itself importing code path, but Spark Connect now has the case via checking dependency checking (which attempts to import pandas) which exposes the actual problem.\r\n\r\nRunning it with IPython can easily reproduce the error:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nPYSPARK_PYTHON=ipython bin/pyspark --remote \"local[*]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make PySpark shell properly import other packages even when the names conflict with subpackages (e.g., `pyspark.pandas` vs `pandas`)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo to the end users:\r\n- Because this path is only inserted for `shell.py` execution, and thankfully we didn't have such relative import case so far.\r\n- It fixes the issue in the unreleased, Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nPYSPARK_PYTHON=ipython bin/pyspark --remote \"local[*]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nPython 3.9.16 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Feb  1 2023, 21:42:20)\r\nType 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information\r\nIPython 8.10.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the developer documentation by removing the warnings about API compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWe actually are going to keep the compatibility there. Such warnings cause a misconception that we can just break the compatibility there.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's developer-only docs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLinters in CI should test it

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `AddMetadataColumns` analyzer rule is designed to resolve metadata columns using `LogicalPlan.metadataOutput` -- even if the plan already contains projections whose output does not specifically include a requested metadata column.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the `SubqueryAlias` plan node intentionally does _NOT_ propagate metadata columns automatically from a non-leaf/non-subquery child node, because the following should _NOT_ work:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.table(\"t\").select(\"a\", \"b\").as(\"s\").select(\"_metadata\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the current implementation is too strict in breaking the metadata chain, in case the child node's output already includes the metadata column:\r\n```scala\r\n// expected to work (and does)\r\nspark.read.table(\"t\")\r\n  .select(\"a\", \"b\").select(\"_metadata\")\r\n\r\n// by extension, this should also work (but does not)\r\nspark.read.table(\"t\").select(\"a\", \"b\", \"_metadata\").as(\"s\")\r\n  .select(\"a\", \"b\").select(\"_metadata\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe solution is for `SubqueryAlias` to propagate metadata columns that are already in the child's output, thus preserving the `metadataOutput` chain for such columns.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of `SubqueryAlias` breaks the intended behavior of metadata column propagation. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The following now works, where previously it did not:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.table(\"t\").select(\"a\", \"b\", \"_metadata\").as(\"s\")\r\n  .select(\"a\", \"b\").select(\"_metadata\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests verify the expected behavior holds, with and without subqueries in the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently when we run yarn-client mode in SparkSubmit, when we catch exceptions during `runMain()`\r\nSpark won't call `SparkContext.stop()` since pr https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33403 remove the behavior.\r\nThen AM side will mark the application as SUCCESS.\r\n\r\nIn this pr, we will revert the behavior of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33403 then YARN mode, it will call `sc.stop()` in YARN env, and also, the client side will pass the correct exit code to the YARN AM side. \r\n\r\nThis pr fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nKeep the same exit code between the client and AM\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was

needed?\r\n\r\nTo recover the build https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/4349682658 with ANSI mode on.\r\nSpark Connect side does not fully leverage the error framework yet .. so simply disabling it for now.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually ran them in IDE with ANSI mode

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes `createDataFrame` to autogenerate missing column names.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently the number of the column names specified to `createDataFrame` does not match the actual number of columns, it raises an error:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([[\"a\", \"b\"]], [\"col1\"])\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nValueError: Length mismatch: Expected axis has 1 elements, new values have 2 elements\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut it should auto-generate the missing column names.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nIt will auto-generate the missing columns:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> spark.createDataFrame([[\"a\", \"b\"]], [\"col1\"])\r\nDataFrame[col1: string, _2:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a rule to align UPDATE assignments with table attributes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed so that we can rewrite UPDATE statements into executable plans for tables that support row-level operations. In particular, our row-level mutation framework assumes Spark is responsible for building an updated version of each affected row and that row is passed back to the data source.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, if there is an executor node loss, we assume the shuffle data on that node is also lost. This is not necessarily the case if there is a shuffle component managing the shuffle data and reliably maintaining it (for example, in distributed filesystem or in a disaggregated shuffle cluster).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDownstream projects have patches to Apache Spark in order to workaround this issue, for example Apache Celeborn has [this](https://github.com/apache/incubator-celeborn/blob/main/assets/spark-patch/RSS_RDA_spark3.patch).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nEnhances the `ShuffleDriverComponents` API, but defaults to current behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests, and added more

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOptimize `Utils.bytesToString`. Arithmetic ops on `BigInt` and `BigDecimal` are order(s) of magnitude slower than the ops on primitive types. Division is an especially slow operation and it is used en masse here.\r\n\r\nTo avoid heating up the Earth while formatting byte counts for human consumption we observe that most formatting operations are not in the 10s of EiBs but on counts that fit in 64-bits and use (fastpath) 64-bit operations to format them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUse of `Utils.bytesToString` is prevalent through the codebase and they are mainly used in logs. If the logs are emitted then this becomes a heavyweight operation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-06T16:09:17Z","updated_at":"2023-03-10T18:27:02Z","closed_at":"2023-03-10T17:27:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"871049726b29ab434f26b45b23691f3c886cf24c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40301/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40301/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40301/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/be5f601698a182c5499ff903acb1d1421acee3a8","head":{"label":"alkis:faster-byte-to-string","ref":"faster-byte-to-string","sha":"be5f601698a182c5499ff903acb1d1421acee3a8","user":{"login":"alkis","id":265981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTk4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/265981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis","html_url":"https://github.com/alkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":470195531,"node_id":"R_kgDOHAadSw","name":"spark","full_name":"alkis/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alkis","id":265981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NTk4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/265981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis","html_url":"https://github.com/alkis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alkis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alkis/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nToday, if a data source already has an output column called `_metadata`, queries cannot access the file-source metadata column that normally carries that name. \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the issue by automatically renaming any metadata column whose name conflicts with an output column. We also introduce a new dataframe method, `metadataColumn`, which mirrors the existing `col` method but (a) only works for metadata columns; and (b) will reliably find metadata columns even if they were renamed due to a name conflict.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nToday, it's too easy to lose access to metadata columns if the user's table happened to have the wrong column name. This sharp edge limits the utility of metadata columns in general, because the feature doesn't work reliably for all table schemas.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nSuppose a table defines a `StringType` column called `_metadata`. Today, the metadata column is not accessible, and the example below would return the table's string column:\r\n```scala\r\ndf.select(\"_metadata\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the change, the original query still returns a string, but the file-source metadata column can be found and accessed by invoking `DataSet.metadataColumn`:\r\n```scala\r\ndf.withColumn(\"m\", df.metadataColumn(\"_metadata\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: Adding a SQL user surface for accessing metadata columns with conflicting names is out of scope for this pull request and can be addressed as future work.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests added.","created_at":"2023-03-06T16:05:28Z","updated_at":"2023-03-30T09:09:32Z","closed_at":"2023-03-30T09:09:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"56a54d043f4579c138d3aa45f55316aa3f8f2ea4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40300/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40300/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40300/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f8b741b9e5171810cbd437f658f467fc733a1928","head":{"label":"ryan-johnson-databricks:metadata-col-rename","ref":"metadata-col-rename","sha":"f8b741b9e5171810cbd437f658f467fc733a1928","user":{"login":"ryan-johnson-databricks","id":79601771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjAxNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79601771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks","html_url":"https://github.com/ryan-johnson-databricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":523479704,"node_id":"R_kgDOHzOqmA","name":"spark","full_name":"ryan-johnson-databricks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ryan-johnson-databricks","id":79601771,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NjAxNzcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79601771?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks","html_url":"https://github.com/ryan-johnson-databricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryan-johnson-databricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ryan-johnson-databricks/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduce spark.hive.exec.dynamic.partition.savePartitions=true (default false) spark.hive.exec.dynamic.partition.savePartitions.tableNamePrefix=hive_dynamic_inserted_partitions\r\nwhen spark.hive.exec.dynamic.partition.savePartitions=true we save the partitions to the \r\ntemporary view $spark.hive.exec.dynamic.partition.savePartitions.tableNamePrefix_$dbName_$tableName\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen hive.exec.dynamic.partition=true and hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode=nonstrict, we can insert table by sql like 'insert overwrite table aaa partition(dt) select xxxx',  of course we can know the partitions inserted into the table by the sql itself,  but if we want do something for common use, we need some common way to get the inserted partitions,  for example:\r\n\r\n    spark.sql(\"insert overwrite table aaa partition(dt) select xxxx\")  //insert table\r\n    val partitions = getInsertedPartitions()   //need some way to get inserted partitions\r\n    monitorInsertedPartitions(partitions)    //do something for common use\r\nThis pull request will allow user to get inserted partitions in a common way\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnew unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently the grammar for ALTER TABLE ADD|REPLACE column is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nqualifiedColTypeWithPosition\r\n: name=multipartIdentifier dataType (NOT NULL)? defaultExpression? commentSpec? colPosition?\r\n;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis enforces a constraint on the order of: (NOT NULL, DEFAULT value, COMMENT value FIRST|AFTER value). We can update the grammar to allow these options in any order instead, to improve usability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis helps make the SQL syntax more usable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the SQL syntax updates slightly.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting and new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison` to support unwrapping date type to string type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAvoid always fetching all partitions because the partition filters cannot be pushed down to the Hive metastore. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1(id int, dt string) using parquet PARTITIONED BY (dt);\r\nEXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE dt > date_add(current_date(), -7);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore Spark 3.0. It pushes partition filters to Hive metastore:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) FileScan parquet default.t1[id#2,dt#3] Batched: true, Format: Parquet, Location: PrunedInMemoryFileIndex[], PartitionCount: 0, PartitionFilters: [isnotnull(dt#3), (dt#3 > 2023-02-27)], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter SPARK-27638. Because it can not [convert partition filters](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.0.0/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/client/HiveShim.scala#L794-L798) to hive metastore filters, it will not push partition filters to Hive metastore. As a result, it always takes all the parititons:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n+- FileScan parquet default.t1[id#5,dt#6] Batched: true, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(0 paths)[], PartitionFilters: [isnotnull(dt#6), (cast(dt#6 as date) > 2023-02-27)], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR. It unwraps date type to string type and then pushes partition filters to Hive metastore:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n+- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.t1[id#0,dt#1] Batched: true, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(0 paths)[], PartitionFilters: [isnotnull(dt#1), (dt#1 > 2023-02-27)], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWrite temp checkpoints for streaming queries to local filesystem even if default FS is set differently\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have seen cases where the default FS could be a remote file system and since the path for streaming checkpoints is not specified explcitily, this could cause pileup under 2 cases:\r\n\r\n- query exits with exception and the flag to force checkpoint removal is not set\r\n- driver/cluster terminates without query being terminated gracefully\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nVerified that the checkpoint is resolved and written to the local FS\r\n\r\n```\r\n23/03/04 01:42:49 INFO ResolveWriteToStream: Checkpoint root

and experimental feature of PySpark that enables Spark to run anywhere and work with different data stores and services. Adding a brief description of Spark Connect to the main page will inform users about this feature and how it can benefit their use cases. Additionally, the note about the experimental nature of this feature will help users understand the potential risks of using Spark Connect in production environments.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently a stage will be resubmitted in a few scenarios:\r\n1. Task failed with `FetchFailed` will trigger stage re-submit;\r\n2. Barrier task failed;\r\n3. Shuffle data loss due to executor/host decommissioned;\r\n\r\nFor the first 2 scenarios, there is a config `spark.stage.maxConsecutiveAttempts` to limit the retry times. While for the 3rd scenario, there'll be potential risks for inifinite retry if there are always executors hosting the shuffle data from successful tasks got killed/lost, the stage will be re-run again and again.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the potential risk, the proposal in this PR is to add a new config `spark.stage.maxConsecutiveAttempts` to limit the overall max attempts number for each stage, the stage will be aborted once the retry times beyond the limitation.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid the potential risks for stage infinite retry.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdded limitation for stage retry times, so jobs may fail if they need to retry for mutiplte times beyond the limitation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMake use of the new spark-connect script to make the Scala client test to not directly depends on any other modules.\r\nThe dependency is still there but hidden by the spark-connect script. When calling the script to start the server, the script performs a `build/sbt package` to ensure all the jars are build and can be found in the correct path. \r\n\r\nAfter the change, we can use the following commands to run the Scala client tests:\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean\r\nbuild/mvn compile -pl connector/connect/client/jvm\r\nbuild/mvn test -pl connector/connect/client/jvm\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean\r\nbuild/sbt \"testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.ClientE2ETestSuite\" \r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean\r\nbuild/sbt \"connect-client-jvm/test\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Scala 2.13**\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean\r\nbuild/mvn -Pscala-2.13 compile -pl connector/connect/client/jvm -am -DskipTests\r\nbuild/mvn -Pscala-2.13 test -pl connector/connect/client/jvm\r\n\r\n// These commands failed with errors to find catalyst ArrowWriter. The error seems unrelated to this change.\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean\r\nbuild/sbt \"testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.ClientE2ETestSuite\" -Pscala-2.13\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/sbt clean\r\nbuild/sbt \"connect-client-jvm/test\" -Pscala-2.13\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the change, the waiting time to run the E2ESuite is ~3min for a clean build. Then ~1min for subsequent runs. The test is slower only because we moved the build time from many commands to this single command. There is no limitations to add more tests as the delay is only caused by the shared server start time. Once the server is started, the tests run fast.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA single command for maven users to mvn clean install to run tests and build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBuild, Manual tests.","created_at":"2023-03-04T01:06:04Z","updated_at":"2023-04-07T21:42:03Z","closed_at":"2023-04-07T21:42:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5062ef85e9ff568b45b24af6c5e337cfa840f154","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40274/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40274/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40274/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/874bc676a98ebf5b0ffd3ed28901e94891bacc2f","head":{"label":"zhenlineo:one-cmd-for-it","ref":"one-cmd-for-it","sha":"874bc676a98ebf5b0ffd3ed28901e94891bacc2f","user":{"login":"zhenlineo","id":4190164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4190164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":464980742,"node_id":"R_kgDOG7cLBg","name":"spark","full_name":"zhenlineo/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhenlineo","id":4190164,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxOTAxNjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4190164?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo","html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhenlineo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhenlineo/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe have seen some cases where the task exits as cancelled/failed which triggers the abort in the task completion listener for HDFSStateStoreProvider. As part of this, we cancel the backing stream and close the compressed stream. However, different stores such as Azure blob store could throw exceptions which are not caught in the current path, leading to job failures. This change proposes to fix this issue by catching all non fatal exceptions thrown by cancel/close.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanges are required to avoid job failures due to exceptions thrown by output stream handlers on abort with the HDFSStateStoreProvider.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified a test and simulated a NPE in the abort path and verified that the task and thereby the job fails before this change.\r\nAfter the change, the test passes fine.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-04T00:36:47Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T11:23:26Z","closed_at":"2023-03-06T11:23:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5928b5f3c9db82dd4fe68a5485aa0d8474a25c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

The idea is we reuse user context(e.g. user_id), gRPC channel, etc. But differentiate different Spark Remote Session by client id, which is generated randomly. \r\n\r\nSo this idea has the benefits of:\r\n1. reusing gRPC channel to not over too manny connections to the server.\r\n2. Each user can has multiple remote sessions, differentiated by client ids (or named session ids in server side).  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the `pyspark.sql.functions`, we replaced `from typing import foo, bar, etc` with `import typing` and all\r\nuses of `foo`, `bar` and `etc` in that module were replaced with `typing.foo`, `typing.bar` and `typing.etc`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExposing methods from `typing` inside `spark.sql.functions` could lead to confusing errors on the user side, like in this example:\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import functions as f\r\n\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\ndf = spark.sql(\"\"\"SELECT 1 as a\"\"\")\r\ndf.withColumn(\"a\", f.cast(\"STRING\", f.col(\"a\"))).printSchema()  \r\n```\r\nThe code above runs without raising any error but yields an incorrect result:\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n|-- a: integer (nullable = false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because `f.cast` is in fact `typing.cast` and we should have used `f.col(\"a\").cast(\"STRING\")` instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if a user has made the mistake described in the example above, their code that did run (with an incorrect behaviour) will instead break after they upgrade to a version containing this change. \r\nBut one could argue that it would be a good thing, since it will expose a mistake in their code.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo new test were added.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support `withSequenceColumn` as PySpark DataFrame internal function.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo prepare supporting pandas API on Spark with Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nWe currently use `distributed-sequence` as default index type in pandas API on Spark, but it's not working for Spark Connect as it is because the distributed sequence index is implemented by leveraging the `withSequenceColumn` which is implemented on JVM side as below:\r\n```python\r\n            # This can't be used in Spark Connect, because Spark Connect client is not depends on JVM.\r\n            return SparkDataFrame(\r\n                sdf._jdf.toDF().withSequenceColumn(column_name),\r\n                sdf.sparkSession,\r\n            )\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to operate with the same code in the existing general PySpark DataFrame and Spark Connect DataFrame, this PR proposes to make `withSequenceColumn` can be used as a PySpark internal function as suggested below:\r\n```python\r\n            # This works both in regular/connect PySpark DataFrame\r\n            return sdf._withSequenceColumn(column_name)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first PR in preparation for supporting the pandas API on Spark in Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, this API is added intended to internal usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs for Scala and Python codes.\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-03T16:09:14Z","updated_at":"2023-04-22T05:49:18Z","closed_at":"2023-03-21T03:41:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b34e8ac64a632e41eeb576d8257399c6ea20477","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe website was recently released with a new style. This patch adopts the same style for the docs page.\r\n\r\n#### How was this done?\r\nThe main website and the docs page are built on bootstrap for styling. This means that particular styles applied to the main page will work nicely on the docs page as well. The biggest chunk of work was to simply copy the stylesheet, the long tail was some manual adjustments.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Copy the main stylesheet from the new website and drop it into the docs build\r\n* Remove the old CSS from the layout\r\n* Update the layout to use the new bootstrap 5 instead of the old bootstrap\r\n* Use bootstrap for tab visibility instead of home-grown JS\r\n* Use bootstrap for table striping instead of custom CSS\r\n* Update all 139 tables to have a proper `thead` to render nicely\r\n* Keep the navigation bar top fixed, with a body top padding.\r\n* Copied minor CSS properties from the old stylesheet to the new one to handle the folding side bar menu.\r\n* Using bootstrap from CDN instead of local\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Images\r\n<img width=\"1266\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR improves `ConstantPropagation` rule, the new implementation:\r\n- Collects constants into a map directly, instead of a list that is then transformed into a map.\r\n- Supports substituting in conflicting equalities:\r\n  e.g. `a = 1 AND a = 2` => `a = 1 AND 1 = 2`\r\n  Before this PR this unsatisfiable filter was not reduced:\r\n  ```\r\n  == Physical Plan ==\r\n  *(1) Project [value#219 AS a#222]\r\n  +- *(1) Filter ((isnotnull(value#219) AND (value#219 = 1)) AND (value#219 = 2))\r\n     +- *(1) LocalTableScan [value#219]\r\n  ```\r\n  But after this PR it is:\r\n  ```\r\n  == Physical Plan ==\r\n  LocalTableScan <empty>, [a#222]\r\n  ```\r\n- Allows substitution in other than `EqualTo` and `EqualNullSafe` `BinaryComparison`expressions:\r\n  e.g. `a = 5 AND b < a + 3` => `a = 5 AND b < 8`\r\n- Gets rid of the `Option` wrapper from the return type of `ConstantPropagation.traverse()` as modern `.mapExpressions()`, `.withNewChildren()` and `.mapChildren()` methods can recognize if there was no change in arguments.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UTs are taken from @wangyum's PR

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe should run `InferFiltersFromConstraints` again after running `RewritePredicateSubquery` rule. `RewritePredicateSubquery `rewrite IN and EXISTS queries to LEFT SEMI/LEFT ANTI joins. But we don't infer filters for these newly generated joins. We noticed in TPCH 1TB q21 by inferring filter for these new joins, one `lineitem` table scan can be reduced as `ReusedExchange` got introduce. Previously due to mismatch in filter predicates reuse was not happening.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCan improve query performance.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPlanStability

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42635. See the following *user-facing* changes for details.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This PR fixes the three problems mentioned in SPARK-42635:\r\n\r\n1. When the time is close to daylight saving time transition, the result may be discontinuous and not monotonic.\r\n2. Adding month, quarter, and year silently ignores `Int` overflow during unit conversion.\r\n3. Adding sub-month units (week, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond)silently ignores `Long` overflow during unit conversion.\r\n\r\nSome examples of the result changes:\r\n\r\nOld results:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// In America/Los_Angeles timezone:\r\ntimestampadd(DAY, 1, 2011-03-12 03:00:00) = 2011-03-13 03:00:00 (this is correct, put it here for comparison)\r\ntimestampadd(HOUR, 23, 2011-03-12 03:00:00) = 2011-03-13 03:00:00\r\ntimestampadd(HOUR, 24, 2011-03-12 03:00:00) = 2011-03-13 03:00:00\r\ntimestampadd(SECOND, 86400 - 1, 2011-03-12 03:00:00) = 2011-03-13

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr adds a new physical plan `DriverSortExec`. It represents a special case of global `SortExec`  which is the root node. Then we can save one shuffle.\r\n\r\nAdd a new config `spark.sql.execution.driverSortThreshold` to control if it's safe to do sort at driver side. We should make sure the max rows of plan is small enough to avoid oom and preformance regression.\r\n\r\nThis optimization should work fine since It gets benefits from AQE framework that the max rows of logical plan is accurate and it can be propagated cross most of nodes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nImprove performance\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadd test and do some benchmark\r\n\r\nSort 50, 000 rows for such case `df.sort.collect`:\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIntroduces `UnparsedDataType` and delays parsing DDL string for Python UDFs until `SparkConnectClient` is available.\r\n\r\n`UnparsedDataType` carries the DDL string and parse it in the server side.\r\nIt should not be enclosed in other data types.\r\n\r\nAlso changes `createDataFrame` to use the proto `DDLParse`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `parse_data_type` depends on `PySparkSession` that creates a local PySpark, but it won't be available in the client side.\r\n\r\nWhen `SparkConnectClient` is available, we can use the new proto `DDLParse` to parse the data types as string.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThe UDF's `returnType` attribute could be a string in Spark Connect if it is provided as string.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2023-03-02T23:31:51Z","updated_at":"2023-03-09T11:14:20Z","closed_at":"2023-03-09T11:14:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14cf9fb5915f1fb90eb9a9aec57bea42551aebab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40260/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40260/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40260/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2a8bcf521c55ebcf194f699505021187ad9239aa","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-42630/ddl_parse","ref":"issues/SPARK-42630/ddl_parse","sha":"2a8bcf521c55ebcf194f699505021187ad9239aa","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

The mechanism follows the protocol as defined in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40147 and supports batching (for multiple \"small\" artifacts) and chunking (for large artifacts).\r\n\r\nNote: Server-side artifact handling is not covered in this PR.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn the decoupled client-server architecture of Spark Connect, a remote client may use a local JAR or a new class in their UDF that may not be present on the server. To handle these cases of missing \"artifacts\", we implement a mechanism to transfer artifacts from the client side over to the server side as per the protocol defined in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40147.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, users would be able to use the `addArtifact` and `addArtifacts` methods (via a `SparkSession` instance) to transfer local files (`.jar` and `.class` extensions).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests - located in `ArtifactSuite`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to ensure \"at least one time unit should be given for interval literal\" by modifying SqlBaseParser.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40195\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nINTERVAL is a Non-Reserved keyword in spark. But when I run\r\n```shell\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select interval from mytable\")\r\n```\r\nI get\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\r\nat least one time unit should be given for interval literal(line 1, pos 7)== SQL ==\r\nselect interval from mytable\r\n-------^^^  at org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryParsingErrors$.invalidIntervalLiteralError(QueryParsingErrors.scala:196)\r\n......\r\n```\r\nIt is a bug because \"Non-Reserved keywords\" have a special meaning in particular contexts and can be used as identifiers in other contexts. So by design, INTERVAL can be used as a column name.\r\n\r\nCurrently the interval's grammar is\r\n```\r\ninterval\r\n    : INTERVAL (errorCapturingMultiUnitsInterval | errorCapturingUnitToUnitInterval)?\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\nThere is no need to make the time unit nullable, we can ensure \"at least one time unit should be given for interval literal\" if the interval's grammar is\r\n```\r\ninterval\r\n    : INTERVAL (errorCapturingMultiUnitsInterval | errorCapturingUnitToUnitInterval)\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test: PlanParsserSuite.\"SPARK-42553: NonReserved keyword 'interval' can be column name\"\r\n\r\nLocal test\r\n```shell\r\nscala> val myDF = spark.sparkContext.makeRDD(1 to 5).toDF(\"interval\")\r\nmyDF: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [interval: int]\r\n\r\nscala> myDF.createOrReplaceTempView(\"mytable\")\r\n\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select interval from mytable;\").show()\r\n+--------+\r\n|interval|\r\n+--------+\r\n|       1|\r\n|       2|\r\n|       3|\r\n|       4|\r\n|
