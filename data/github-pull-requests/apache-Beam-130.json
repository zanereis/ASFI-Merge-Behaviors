\"custom schema coder\" support. I believe Python and Java call these providers, but that's not exactly what's happening in the Go SDK. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to register a factory function for schema coder functions for a given type. This enables overriding the default behavior for Go types in the schema coders with a custom one, for the type itself, or any matching interface.\r\n\r\nTo ensure users *can* write custom schema coders, a testing utility has been added to validate the factory functions, and ensure the coders encode to a valid schema equivalent type.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks were added to demonstrate the umbrella helper coder functions, using a custom coder function, registering a custom coder function, and comparing to the equivalent we use for JSON encoding at present.\r\n\r\nThere are more details to work on here, but this moves everything closer to having fields of an umbrella type be encoded properly without breaking things, eg. for hanlding proto fields, which aren't encoded as proper JSON.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

how to write Iceberg tables using Beam.\r\n\r\nBy removing the PDone, and emit the files that are written, we can add these to the [Table Format, such as Iceberg](https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny-2018/cdn.oreillystatic.com/en/assets/1/event/278/Introducing%20Iceberg_%20Tables%20designed%20for%20object%20stores%20Presentation.pdf), Hudi or Delta.\r\n\r\nExploring the possible approaches, but I think this is a very fruitful direction since we can fully re-use the existing `Avro/Parquet/..` writers, and emit the WriteFilesResult to the next operator, which will append the new files to the Iceberg log.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to change the API in Apache Beam so we can use the `WriteFilesResult`. Add the Iceberg extension in the Iceberg repository itself. This will be a `PTransform<WriteFilesResult<?>, PDone>`. Maybe I'll change the `PDone` to a `Table` (Iceberg Table) as well. So you can signal downstream consumers. I'll open this PR somewhere next week, but would like to know your idea's as well! :)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

engineers encounter times when schema of Parquet file is unknown at the time of writing the pipeline or multiple schema may be present in different files.  Reading Parquet files using ParquetIO requires providing an Avro (equivalent) schema, Many a times its not possible to know the schema of the Parquet files.\r\nOn the other hand [AvroIO](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.26.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/AvroIO.html) supports reading unknow schema files by providing a parse function : `#parseGenericRecords(SerializableFunction<GenericRecord,T>)`\r\n\r\nSupporting this functionality in ParquetIO is simple and requires minimal changes to the ParquetIO surface.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a bug introduced by #13202 where the parent for a fused stage (or packed combiner) gets set to `None` if more than two stages are fused (or packed). This occurs because `_lowest_common_ancestor` uses the `subtransforms` field of the `PipelineContext`'s transforms to figure out parent-child relationships. However, a stage that is created by fusion or by another optimizer phase will not be present in the `PipelineContext`'s transforms. As a result, such a stage is passed to `_lowest_common_ancestor`, it will return `None`. This change fixes it by additionally using the `parent` field of the input stages.\r\n\r\nThis bug only affects runners that use `translations.pipeline_from_stages` with `partial=True`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

improves the readability of the stage and transform names for transforms and stages resulting from the `translations.eliminate_common_key_with_none` and `translations.pack_combiners`. This also fixes an issue where the transform name was incorrectly set to the stage name.\r\n\r\nFor example, for `TranslationsTest.test_pack_combiners`, previously both the Pack transform and stage  were set to `(ref_AppliedPTransform_multiple-combines/mean-perkey/CombinePerKey(MeanCombineFn)_16)+(ref_AppliedPTransform_multiple-combines/count-perkey/CombinePerKey(CountCombineFn)_21)/Pack`. After this change, the Pack transform name is set to `multiple-combines/Packed[mean-perkey/CombinePerKey(MeanCombineFn), count-perkey/CombinePerKey(CountCombineFn)]/Pack` and the Pack stage name is set to `ref_AppliedPTransform_multiple-combines/Packed[mean-perkey/CombinePerKey(MeanCombineFn)_16, count-perkey/CombinePerKey(CountCombineFn)_21]/Pack`. The Unpack transform and stage are named similarly, but with the suffix `/Unpack` instead of `/Pack`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
