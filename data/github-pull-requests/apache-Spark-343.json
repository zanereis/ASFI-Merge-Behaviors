This has two main issues:\nIt can break across spark releases (though this is not the only thing preventing us from upgrading a running query)\nIt is unnecessarily opaque to the user.\nI'd propose we require offsets to provide a user readable serialization and use that instead. JSON is probably a good option.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTests were added for KafkaSourceOffset in [KafkaSourceOffsetSuite](external/kafka-0-10-sql/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/kafka010/KafkaSourceOffsetSuite.scala) and for LongOffset in [OffsetSuite](sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/streaming/OffsetSuite.scala)\n\nPlease review https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/Contributing+to+Spark before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we have several test cases for group analytics(ROLLUP/CUBE/GROUPING SETS) in `SQLQuerySuite`, should better move them into a query file test.\nThe following test cases are moved to `group-analytics.sql`:\n\n```\ntest(\"rollup\")\ntest(\"grouping sets when aggregate functions containing groupBy columns\") \ntest(\"cube\")\ntest(\"grouping sets\")\ntest(\"grouping and grouping_id\")\ntest(\"grouping and grouping_id in having\")\ntest(\"grouping and grouping_id in sort\")\n```\n\nThis is followup work of #15582 \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nModified query file `group-analytics.sql`, which will be tested by `SQLQueryTestSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-10-25T15:43:21Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T10:50:36Z","closed_at":"2016-10-26T21:53:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd7a0f8a3014230f26900d4f2b64877f582e78bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15624/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15624/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15624/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b85c5f9063ef329011b6676218e982e811364fd2","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:group-analytics-test","ref":"group-analytics-test","sha":"b85c5f9063ef329011b6676218e982e811364fd2","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFix for SPARK-18091 which is a bug related to large if expressions causing generated SpecificUnsafeProjection code to exceed JVM code size limit. \n\nThis PR changes if expression's code generation to place its predicate, true value and false value expressions' generated code in separate methods in context so as to never generate too long combined code.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a unit test and also tested manually with the application (having transformations similar to the unit test) which caused the issue to be identified in the first place.\n","created_at":"2016-10-25T09:42:04Z","updated_at":"2016-12-12T02:43:19Z","closed_at":"2016-12-04T09:19:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a043b21ca6365b22fb7368e1990ef0656c7ea6c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15620/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15620/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15620/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/260c8e85c613eaa458ff28caf0e987419dc8c895","head":{"label":"kapilsingh5050:SPARK-18091-IfCodegenFix","ref":"SPARK-18091-IfCodegenFix","sha":"260c8e85c613eaa458ff28caf0e987419dc8c895","user":{"login":"kapilsingh5050","id":15405233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA1MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15405233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050","html_url":"https://github.com/kapilsingh5050","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":45231748,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTIzMTc0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"kapilsingh5050/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kapilsingh5050","id":15405233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NDA1MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15405233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050","html_url":"https://github.com/kapilsingh5050","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kapilsingh5050/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kapilsingh5050/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE tab1(col1 int COMMENT 'a', col2 int) USING parquet\nINSERT INTO TABLE tab1 SELECT 1, 2\n```\n\nThe insert attempt will fail if the target table has a column with comments. The error is strange to the external users:\n\n```\nassertion failed: No plan for InsertIntoTable Relation[col1#15,col2#16] parquet, false, false\n+- Project [1 AS col1#19, 2 AS col2#20]\n   +- OneRowRelation$\n```\n\nThis PR is to fix the above bug by checking the metadata when comparing the schema between the table and the query. If not matched, we also copy the metadata. This is an alternative to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15266\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nadd `ZipPartitionsRDDUtils.zipPartitionsWithPreferredLocation` helper function.\nThe zipPartitionsWithPreferredLocation helper function is similar to RDD.zipPartitions, but\nit can be used to specify the zipPartitions task preferred locations to be consistent with\nthe fisrt zipped RDD. If the fisrt zipped RDD do not have preferred location, it will fallback to the default `zipPartition` preferred location strategy.\n\nThis option can be used in such scenario:\nA large RDD zipped with other much smaller RDDs,  we can set the first zipped RDD to be the large RDD to improve data locality.\n### Performance test\n\nI test this improvement on **spark-tfocus** DMatrix multiplying DVector operator **LinopMatrixAdjoint**\nhttps://github.com/databricks/spark-tfocs/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/mllib/optimization/tfocs/fs/dvector/vector/LinopMatrixAdjoint.scala\n\nI generate the `DMatrix` RDD, using 100 partitions and each partition contains about 100MB data. and the `DVector` also 100 partitions, each partitions about 1MB data, and I start the job using 20 executors on 20 nodes, each executor contains 4 cores. and I set the `spark.locality.wait` to be 3000ms, the result show that using `ZipPartitionsRDDUtils.zipPartitionsWithPreferredLocation`, it brings about 20% ~ 30% performance improvement.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`ZipPartitionsRDDUtilsSuite` added.\n","created_at":"2016-10-24T16:43:19Z","updated_at":"2019-04-24T21:19:26Z","closed_at":"2017-06-13T03:00:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7b5e3226a3df1923b443fe14f5f422dbafb2524","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/439def9e5fd46f0650cba24c9232c3f62349023e","head":{"label":"WeichenXu123:customize_zipPartition_task_preferredLocation","ref":"customize_zipPartition_task_preferredLocation","sha":"439def9e5fd46f0650cba24c9232c3f62349023e","user":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58255485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODI1NTQ4NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"WeichenXu123/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WeichenXu123","id":19235986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjM1OTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19235986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123","html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeichenXu123/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WeichenXu123/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis change adds a type conversion from false value datatype to true value’s datatype.\n\nEarlier, the expression If(Literal.create(true, BooleanType), Literal.create(identity(1), DateType), Literal.create(identity(2L), TimestampType))  was throwing Exception while the expression If(Literal.create(true, BooleanType), Literal.create(identity(1L), TimestampType), Literal.create(identity(2), DateType)) was working fine. So , if we interchange the true and false expressions, behaviour of the IF expression changes.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test case in ConditionalExpressionSuite.scala\n\njira entry for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR proposes to\n- improve the R-friendly error messages rather than raw JVM exception one.\n  \n  As `read.json`, `read.text`, `read.orc`, `read.parquet` and `read.jdbc` are executed in the same  path with `read.df`, and `write.json`, `write.text`, `write.orc`, `write.parquet` and `write.jdbc` shares the same path with `write.df`, it seems it is safe to call `handledCallJMethod` to handle \n  JVM messages.\n-  prevent `zero-length variable name` and prints the ignored options as an warning message.\n\n**Before**\n\n``` r\n>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18067 for discussion. Putting out a PR to get some feedback about the approach.\n\nAssume that there are two tables with columns `key` and `value` both hash partitioned over `key`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe following FIFO & FAIR Schedulers Pool usage cases need to have unit test coverage :\n- FIFO Scheduler just uses **root pool** so even if `spark.scheduler.pool` property is set, related pool is not created and `TaskSetManagers` are added to **root pool**.\n- FAIR Scheduler uses `default pool` when `spark.scheduler.pool` property is not set. This can be happened when \n  - `Properties` object is **null**, \n  - `Properties` object is **empty**(`new Properties()`), \n  - **default pool** is set(`spark.scheduler.pool=default`).\n- FAIR Scheduler creates a **new pool** with **default values** when `spark.scheduler.pool` property points a **non-existent** pool. This can be happened when **scheduler allocation file** is not set or it does not contain related pool.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew Unit tests are

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15272 to 2.0 branch.\n\nJira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17698\n\n`ExtractEquiJoinKeys` is incorrectly using filter predicates as the join condition for joins. `canEvaluate` [0] tries to see if the an `Expression` can be evaluated using output of a given `Plan`. In case of filter predicates (eg. `a.id='1'`), the `Expression` passed for the right hand side (ie. '1' ) is a `Literal` which does not have any attribute references. Thus `expr.references` is an empty set which theoretically is a subset of any set. This leads to `canEvaluate` returning `true` and `a.id='1'` is treated as a join predicate. While this does not lead to incorrect results but in case of bucketed + sorted tables, we might miss out on avoiding un-necessary shuffle + sort. See example below:\n\n[0] : https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/predicates.scala#L91\n\neg.\n\n```\nval df = (1 until 10).toDF(\"id\").coalesce(1)\nhc.sql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table1\").collect\ndf.write.bucketBy(8, \"id\").sortBy(\"id\").saveAsTable(\"table1\")\nhc.sql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table2\").collect\ndf.write.bucketBy(8, \"id\").sortBy(\"id\").saveAsTable(\"table2\")\n\nsqlContext.sql(\"\"\"\n  SELECT a.id, b.id\n  FROM table1 a\n  FULL OUTER JOIN table2 b\n  ON a.id = b.id AND a.id='1' AND b.id='1'\n\"\"\").explain(true)\n```\n\nBEFORE: This is doing shuffle + sort over table scan outputs which is not needed as both tables are bucketed and sorted on the same columns and have same number of buckets. This should be a single stage job.\n\n```\nSortMergeJoin [id#38, cast(id#38 as double), 1.0], [id#39, 1.0, cast(id#39 as double)], FullOuter\n:- *Sort [id#38 ASC NULLS FIRST, cast(id#38 as double) ASC NULLS FIRST, 1.0 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#38, cast(id#38 as double), 1.0, 200)\n:     +- *FileScan parquet default.table1[id#38] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:spark-warehouse/table1, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\n+- *Sort [id#39 ASC NULLS FIRST, 1.0 ASC NULLS FIRST, cast(id#39 as double) ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#39, 1.0, cast(id#39 as double), 200)\n      +- *FileScan parquet default.table2[id#39] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:spark-warehouse/table2, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\n```\n\nAFTER :\n\n```\nSortMergeJoin [id#32], [id#33], FullOuter, ((cast(id#32 as double) = 1.0) && (cast(id#33 as double) = 1.0))\n:- *FileScan parquet default.table1[id#32] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:spark-warehouse/table1, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\n+- *FileScan parquet default.table2[id#33] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:spark-warehouse/table2, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Added a new test case for this scenario : `SPARK-17698 Join predicates should not contain filter clauses`\n- Ran all the tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe `UnaryNode.getAliasedConstraints` function fails to replace all expressions by their alias where constraints contains more than one expression to be replaced. \nFor example:\n\n```\nval tr = LocalRelation('a.int, 'b.string, 'c.int)\nval multiAlias = tr.where('a === 'c + 10).select('a.as('x), 'c.as('y))\nmultiAlias.analyze.constraints\n```\n\ncurrently outputs:\n\n```\nExpressionSet(Seq(\n    IsNotNull(resolveColumn(multiAlias.analyze, \"x\")),\n    IsNotNull(resolveColumn(multiAlias.analyze, \"y\"))\n)\n```\n\nThe constraint `resolveColumn(multiAlias.analyze, \"x\") === resolveColumn(multiAlias.analyze, \"y\") + 10)` is missing.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd new test cases in `ConstraintPropagationSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-10-22T06:39:44Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T02:02:26Z","closed_at":"2016-10-26T18:14:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cee2a4dfbdf81c5079924f1f4b814fc1a7d23483","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3f0749338c917301c24330d95a839ab1e7151a1d","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:alias-constraints","ref":"alias-constraints","sha":"3f0749338c917301c24330d95a839ab1e7151a1d","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark Thriftserver when running in HTTP mode with Kerberos enabled gives a 401 authentication error when receiving beeline HTTP request (with end user as kerberos principal). The similar command works with Hive Thriftserver.\r\n\r\nWhat we find is Hive thriftserver CLI service creates both hive service and SPNego principal when kerberos is enabled whereas Spark Thriftserver only creates hive service principal.\r\n\r\nCLIService.java\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled()) {\r\n      try {\r\n        HiveAuthFactory.loginFromKeytab(hiveConf);\r\n        this.serviceUGI = Utils.getUGI();\r\n      } catch (IOException e) {\r\n        throw new ServiceException(\"Unable to login to kerberos with given principal/keytab\", e);\r\n      } catch (LoginException e) {\r\n        throw new ServiceException(\"Unable to login to kerberos with given principal/keytab\", e);\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // Also try creating a UGI object for the SPNego principal\r\n  String principal = hiveConf.getVar(ConfVars.HIVE_SERVER2_SPNEGO_PRINCIPAL);\r\n  String keyTabFile = hiveConf.getVar(ConfVars.HIVE_SERVER2_SPNEGO_KEYTAB);\r\n  if (principal.isEmpty() || keyTabFile.isEmpty()) {\r\n    LOG.info(\"SPNego httpUGI not created, spNegoPrincipal: \" + principal +\r\n        \", ketabFile: \" + keyTabFile);\r\n  } else {\r\n    try {\r\n      this.httpUGI = HiveAuthFactory.loginFromSpnegoKeytabAndReturnUGI(hiveConf);\r\n      LOG.info(\"SPNego httpUGI successfully created.\");\r\n    } catch (IOException e) {\r\n      LOG.warn(\"SPNego httpUGI creation failed: \", e);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSparkSQLCLIService.scala\r\n```\r\n if (UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled) {\r\n      try {\r\n        HiveAuthFactory.loginFromKeytab(hiveConf)\r\n        sparkServiceUGI = Utils.getUGI()\r\n        setSuperField(this, \"serviceUGI\", sparkServiceUGI)\r\n      } catch {\r\n        case e @ (_: IOException | _: LoginException) =>\r\n          throw new ServiceException(\"Unable to login to kerberos with given principal/keytab\", e)\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe patch will add missing SPNego principal to Spark Thriftserver.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan manual testing with beeline command through spark against kerberized cluster.\r\nRan Spark unit tests for hive, sql and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, the gradient updates for multinomial logistic regression were computed by an outer loop over the number of classes and an inner loop over the number of features. Inside the inner loop, we standardized the feature value (`value / featuresStd(index)`), which means we performed the computation `numFeatures * numClasses` times. We only need to perform that computation `numFeatures` times, however. If we re-order the inner and outer loop, we can avoid this, but then we lose sequential memory access. In this patch, we instead lay out the coefficients in column major order while we train, so that we can avoid the extra computation and retain sequential memory access. We convert back to row-major order when we create the model.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is an implementation detail only, so the original behavior should be maintained. All tests pass. I ran some performance tests to verify speedups. The results are below, and show significant speedups.\r\n## Performance Tests\r\n\r\n**Setup**\r\n\r\n3 node bare-metal cluster\r\n120 cores total\r\n384 gb RAM total\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\nNOTE:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe reason for the flakiness was follows. The test starts the maintenance background thread, and then writes 20 versions of the state store. The maintenance thread is expected to create snapshots in the middle, and clean up old files that are not needed any more. The earliest delta file (1.delta) is expected to be deleted as snapshots will ensure that the earliest delta would not be needed. \n\nHowever, the default configuration for the maintenance thread is to retain files such that last 2 versions can be recovered, and delete the rest. Now while generating the versions, the maintenance thread can kick in and create snapshots anywhere between version 10 and 20 (at least 10 deltas needed for snapshot). Then later it will choose to retain only version 20 and 19 (last 2). There are two cases. \n- Common case: One of the version between 10 and 19 gets snapshotted. Then recovering versions 19 and 20 just needs 19.snapshot and 20.delta, so 1.delta gets deleted.\n- Uncommon case (reason for flakiness): Only version 20 gets snapshotted. Then recovering versoin 20 requires 20.snapshot, and recovering version 19 all the previous 19...1.delta. So 1.delta does not get deleted.\n\nThis PR rearranges the checks such that it create 20 versions, and then waits that there is at least one snapshot, then creates another 20. This will ensure that the latest 2 versions cannot require anything older than the first snapshot generated, and therefore will 1.delta will be deleted.\n\nIn addition, I have added more logs, and comments that I felt would help future debugging and understanding what is going on.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan the StateStoreSuite > 6K times in a heavily loaded machine (10 instances of tests running in parallel). No failures.\n","created_at":"2016-10-21T23:24:40Z","updated_at":"2016-10-25T00:23:39Z","closed_at":"2016-10-25T00:23:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0fef94900a8aaae30d8fcd935eb5ff83d1395774","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15592/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15592/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15592/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/96079fef41aa0b8bf30ecb154e26d4d98e24be5b","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-17624","ref":"SPARK-17624","sha":"96079fef41aa0b8bf30ecb154e26d4d98e24be5b","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJanino compiler internally creates a byteclassloader (http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.codehaus.janino/janino/2.5.15/org/codehaus/janino/ByteArrayClassLoader.java#ByteArrayClassLoader) to load the compiled generated class. But this class loader doesnot override load class to load the class from byte array for the generated class. Instead the call first goes to parent class loader and if somehow the classloader finds the old generatedClass( all the generated class names are same) it will incorrectly load the old generated class. This class loader will be used to intercept delegation to parent if the class has to be loaded by the current byte class loader. This will be set as the parent class loader for janino compiler in CodeGenerator.doCompile.\n\nSpecial classloader to skip delegating to parent class loader when the class name is same as the generated class name. Because that class should be loaded by the current class loader \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nmanual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds a new hash-based aggregate operator named `ObjectHashAggregateExec` that supports `TypedImperativeAggregate`, which may use arbitrary Java objects as aggregation states. Please refer to the [design doc](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12834260/%5BDesign%20Doc%5D%20Support%20for%20Arbitrary%20Aggregation%20States.pdf) attached in [SPARK-17949](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17949) for more details about it.\n\nThe major benefit of this operator is better performance when evaluating `TypedImperativeAggregate` functions, especially when there are relatively few distinct groups. Functions like Hive UDAFs, `collect_list`, and `collect_set` may also benefit from this after being migrated to `TypedImperativeAggregate`.\n\nThe following feature flag is introduced to enable or disable the new aggregate operator:\n- Name: `spark.sql.execution.useObjectHashAggregateExec`\n- Default value: `true`\n\nWe can also configure the fallback threshold using the following SQL operation:\n- Name: `spark.sql.objectHashAggregate.sortBased.fallbackThreshold`\n- Default value: 128\n  \n  Fallback to sort-based aggregation when more than 128 distinct groups are accumulated in the aggregation hash map. This number is intentionally made small to avoid GC problems since aggregation buffers of this operator may contain arbitrary Java objects.\n  \n  This may be improved by implementing size tracking for this operator, but that can be done in a separate PR.\n\nCode generation and size tracking are planned to be implemented in follow-up PRs.\n## Benchmark results\n### `ObjectHashAggregateExec` vs `SortAggregateExec`\n\nThe first benchmark compares `ObjectHashAggregateExec` and `SortAggregateExec` by evaluating `typed_count`, a testing `TypedImperativeAggregate` version of the SQL `count` function.\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_92-b14 on Mac OS X 10.10.5\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-4960HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz\n\nobject agg v.s. sort agg:                Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nsort agg w/ group by                        31251 / 31908          3.4         298.0       1.0X\nobject agg w/ group by w/o fallback           6903 / 7141         15.2          65.8       4.5X\nobject agg w/ group by w/ fallback          20945 / 21613          5.0         199.7       1.5X\nsort agg w/o group by                         4734 / 5463         22.1          45.2       6.6X\nobject agg w/o group by w/o fallback          4310 / 4529         24.3          41.1       7.3X\n```\n\nThe next benchmark compares `ObjectHashAggregateExec` and `SortAggregateExec` by evaluating the Spark native version of `percentile_approx`.\n\nNote that `percentile_approx` is so heavy an aggregate function that the bottleneck of the benchmark is evaluating the aggregate function itself rather than the aggregate operator since I couldn't run a large scale benchmark on my laptop. That's why the results are so close and looks counter-intuitive (aggregation with grouping is even faster than that aggregation without grouping).\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM

0.8X\n```\n### Hive UDAF vs Spark AF\n\nThis benchmark compares the following two kinds of aggregate functions:\n- \"hive udaf\": Hive implementation of `percentile_approx`, without partial aggregation supports, evaluated using `SortAggregateExec`.\n- \"spark af\": Spark native implementation of `percentile_approx`, with partial aggregation support, evaluated using `ObjectHashAggregateExec`\n\nThe performance differences are mostly due to faster implementation and partial aggregation support in the Spark native version of `percentile_approx`.\n\nThis benchmark basically shows the performance differences between the worst case, where an aggregate function without partial aggregation support is evaluated using `SortAggregateExec`, and the best case, where a `TypedImperativeAggregate` with partial aggregation support is evaluated using `ObjectHashAggregateExec`.\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_92-b14 on Mac OS X 10.10.5\nIntel(R) Core(TM)

partial aggregation support\n  \n  24.77 minutes\n- Native implementation, sort-based aggregation, w/ partial aggregation support\n  \n  4.64 minutes\n- Native implementation, object hash aggregator,

synchronous mode of driver and executor is through dummy job is only ensure 1 executor connect to driver.\nIn my cluster I need to ensure each executor have one receiver.\nThinking about following example:\nIf spark.cores.max=4 and spark.executor.cores=2 therefore, it will launch 2 executor instance.\nThe spark first job is running dummy job is always 70 tasks. it takes about 4 seconds.\ncase 1:\nif in this 4 seconds only one executor (E1) connect to driver and another(E2) not\nexecutor 1 will start 2 receiver and did not working tasks. because it had used 2 core.\nexecutor 2 will only do tasks not running receiver .because I write code set 2 receiver stream.\ntherefore the batch running slowly and it have network data transmission.(about 3s)\ncase 2:\nin this 4 seconds 2 executor connected to driver\nexecutor 1 start 1 receiver used 1 core and could do task\nexecutor 2 start 1 receiver used 1 core and could do task\nit is balanced scheduler and running fast (about 0.1s)\n\nSo

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn `FileStreamSource.getBatch`, we will create a `DataSource` with specified schema, to avoid inferring the schema again and again. However, we don't pass the partition columns, and will infer the partition again and again.\n\nThis PR fixes it by keeping the partition columns in `FileStreamSource`, like schema.\n## How was this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds a new \"path\" method on OutputWriter that returns the path of the file written by the OutputWriter. This is part of the necessary work to consolidate structured streaming and batch write paths.\n\nThe batch write path has a nice feature that each data source can define the extension of the files, and allow Spark to specify the staging directory and the prefix for the files. However, in the streaming path we need to collect the list of files written, and there is no interface right now to do that.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A - there is no behavior change and this should be covered by existing tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-21T07:33:38Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T19:01:42Z","closed_at":"2016-10-22T00:29:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e542e00200566191f568cf867e4c16a778aeb0d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15580/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15580/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15580/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3ddaf797fa2d5a2e875e4015865b2a7ef443133","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18042","ref":"SPARK-18042","sha":"d3ddaf797fa2d5a2e875e4015865b2a7ef443133","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSometimes it is rather useful if Spark can run with leading extra arguments. \r\n\r\nFor example, currently Spark is unaware of NUMA, which leads a performance boost when there are many remote memory allocations. \r\n\r\nSo with this patch, it is possible to run Spark with leading commands. \r\nThis patch is not only for NUMA support, but a more general one that makes it possible to integrate Spark with `valgrind` or some trace analysis tools. \r\nIn a word, it pvovides many possibilities to do performance tuning in different use cases.\r\n\r\n**TODO**\r\nCurrently it only works for YARN. Following features for Mesos and Standalone are on the way...\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nIt was tested using BigBench on the cluster described below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCluster Topo: 1 Master + 4 Slaves (Spark on Yarn)\r\nCPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2699 v3 @ 2.30GHz(72 Cores)\r\nMemory: 128GB(2 NUMA Nodes)\r\nNIC: 1x10Gb/Sec\r\nDisk: Write -1.5GB/Sec, Read- 5GB/Sec\r\nSW Version: Hadoop-5.7.0 + Spark-2.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore testing is still being made and this thread will be updated then. Because this is considered to be useful feature, so we would like to publish it out here.\r\n## How to use?\r\n\r\nCurrently it is using environment variable `SPARK_COMMAND_PREFIX` to provide a prefix command before spark (only works for YARN now).\r\nLet's take `strace` as an example. \r\nIn `spark-env.sh` file, specify the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSPARK_COMMAND_PREFIX=\"strace -ttT\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy doing this, Spark will be launched under the above `strace`, thus some information about the time each syscall was made and how long each syscall took will be given.\r\n\r\nFor more information about how to use `strace`, please refer to the [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/strace).\r\n","created_at":"2016-10-21T04:52:00Z","updated_at":"2016-12-29T02:52:09Z","closed_at":"2016-12-28T10:46:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"175889f397495f88d37830c93116b93a7e94c6e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15579/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15579/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15579/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d3628ebb3921490c186fa339881c4213f916809b","head":{"label":"sheepduke:master","ref":"master","sha":"d3628ebb3921490c186fa339881c4213f916809b","user":{"login":"sheepduke","id":11610662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjEwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11610662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke","html_url":"https://github.com/sheepduke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":71521974,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTUyMTk3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sheepduke/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sheepduke","id":11610662,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNjEwNjYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11610662?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke","html_url":"https://github.com/sheepduke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sheepduke/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sheepduke/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18035\n\nIn HiveInspectors, I saw that converting Java map to Spark's `ArrayBasedMapData` spent quite sometime in buffer copying : https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveInspectors.scala#L658\n\nThe reason being `map.toSeq` allocates a new buffer and copies the map entries to it: https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.11.x/src/library/scala/collection/MapLike.scala#L323\n\nThis copy is not needed as we get rid of it once we extract the key and value arrays.\n\nHere is the call trace:\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveInspectors$$anonfun$unwrapperFor$41.apply(HiveInspectors.scala:664)\nscala.collection.AbstractMap.toSeq(Map.scala:59)\nscala.collection.MapLike$class.toSeq(MapLike.scala:323)\nscala.collection.AbstractMap.toBuffer(Map.scala:59)\nscala.collection.MapLike$class.toBuffer(MapLike.scala:326)\nscala.collection.AbstractTraversable.copyToBuffer(Traversable.scala:104)\nscala.collection.TraversableOnce$class.copyToBuffer(TraversableOnce.scala:275)\nscala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.$plus$plus$eq(ArrayBuffer.scala:48)\nscala.collection.mutable.ArrayBuffer.$plus$plus$eq(ArrayBuffer.scala:104)\nscala.collection.generic.Growable$class.$plus$plus$eq(Growable.scala:59)\nscala.collection.AbstractIterable.foreach(Iterable.scala:54)\nscala.collection.IterableLike$class.foreach(IterableLike.scala:72)\nscala.collection.AbstractIterator.foreach(Iterator.scala:1336)\nscala.collection.Iterator$class.foreach(Iterator.scala:893)\nscala.collection.generic.Growable$$anonfun$$plus$plus$eq$1.apply(Growable.scala:59)\nscala.collection.generic.Growable$$anonfun$$plus$plus$eq$1.apply(Growable.scala:59)\n```\n\nAlso, earlier code was populating keys and values arrays separately by iterating twice. The PR avoids double iteration of the map and does it in one iteration.\n\nEDIT: During code review, there were several more places in the code which were found to do similar thing. The PR dedupes those instances and introduces convenient APIs which are performant and memory efficient\n## Performance gains\n\nThe number is subjective and depends on how many map columns are accessed in the query and average entries per map. For one the queries that I tried out, I saw 3% CPU savings (end-to-end) for the query.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis does not change the end result produced so relying on existing tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-20T22:14:45Z","updated_at":"2016-10-23T17:14:24Z","closed_at":"2016-10-23T03:45:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"56e9cb2b48b0be682c0800103a0e2485019cf161","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b263278573adc00fcc3f9fc72604b573936a5516","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:SPARK-18035_avoid_toSeq","ref":"SPARK-18035_avoid_toSeq","sha":"b263278573adc00fcc3f9fc72604b573936a5516","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSimplify/cleanup TableFileCatalog:\n1. pass a `CatalogTable` instead of `databaseName` and `tableName` into `TableFileCatalog`, so that we don't need to fetch table metadata from metastore again\n2. In `TableFileCatalog.filterPartitions0`, DO NOT set `PartitioningAwareFileCatalog.BASE_PATH_PARAM`. According to the [classdoc](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/PartitioningAwareFileCatalog.scala#L189-L209), the default value of `basePath` already satisfies our need. What's more, if we set this parameter, we may break the case 2 which is metioned in the classdoc.\n3. add `equals` and `hashCode` to `TableFileCatalog`\n4. add `SessionCatalog.listPartitionsByFilter` which handles case sensitivity.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-20T13:16:05Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T06:21:21Z","closed_at":"2016-10-25T00:44:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e5bdd8f9c56f9a7a3209a8a3e2b642ad87a5570","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15568/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15568/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15568/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c4a906f99836fab8e21ecd3215112e8b20f218a4","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:table-file-catalog","ref":"table-file-catalog","sha":"c4a906f99836fab8e21ecd3215112e8b20f218a4","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen a user appended a column using a \"nondeterministic\" function to a DataFrame, e.g., `rand`, `randn`, and `monotonically_increasing_id`, the expected semantic is the following:\n- The value in each row should remain unchanged, as if we materialize the column immediately, regardless of later DataFrame operations.\n\nHowever, since we use `TaskContext.getPartitionId` to get the partition index from the current thread, the values from nondeterministic columns might change if we call `union` or `coalesce` after. `TaskContext.getPartitionId` returns the partition index of the current Spark task, which might not be the corresponding partition index of the DataFrame where we defined the column.\n\nSee the unit tests below or JIRA for examples.\n\nThis PR uses the partition index from `RDD.mapPartitionWithIndex` instead of `TaskContext` and fixes the partition initialization logic in whole-stage codegen, normal codegen, and codegen fallback. `initializeStatesForPartition(partitionIndex: Int)` was added to `Projection`, `Nondeterministic`, and `Predicate` (codegen) and initialized right after object creation in `mapPartitionWithIndex`. `newPredicate` now returns a `Predicate` instance rather than a function for proper initialization.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests. (Actually I'm not very confident that this PR fixed all issues without introducing new ones ...)\n\ncc: @rxin @davies

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we always lowercase the partition columns of partition spec in parser, with the assumption that table partition columns are always lowercased.\n\nHowever, this is not true for data source tables, which are case preserving. It's safe for now because data source tables don't store partition spec in metastore and don't support `ADD PARTITION`, `DROP PARTITION`, `RENAME PARTITION`, but we should make our code future-proof.\n\nThis PR makes partition spec case preserving at parser, and improve the `PreprocessTableInsertion` analyzer rule to normalize the partition columns in partition spec, w.r.t. the table partition columns.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMany applications take Spark as a computing engine and run on it. This PR adds a configuration property `spark.log.callerContext` that can be used by Spark's upstream applications (e.g. Oozie) to set up their caller contexts into Spark. In the end, Spark will combine its own caller context with the caller contexts of its upstream applications, and write them into Yarn RM log and HDFS audit log.\r\n\r\nThe audit log has a config to truncate the caller contexts passed in (default 128). The caller contexts will be sent over rpc, so it should be concise. The call context written into HDFS log and Yarn log consists of two parts: the information `A` specified by Spark itself and the value `B` of `spark.log.callerContext` property.  Currently `A` typically takes 64 to 74 characters,  so `B` can have up to 50 characters (mentioned in the doc `running-on-yarn.md`)\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests. I have run some Spark applications with `spark.log.callerContext` configuration in Yarn client/cluster mode, and verified that the caller contexts were written into Yarn RM log and HDFS audit log correctly.\r\n\r\nThe ways to configure `spark.log.callerContext` property:\r\n- In spark-defaults.conf:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark.log.callerContext  infoSpecifiedByUpstreamApp\r\n```\r\n- In app's source code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nval spark = SparkSession\r\n      .builder\r\n      .appName(\"SparkKMeans\")\r\n      .config(\"spark.log.callerContext\", \"infoSpecifiedByUpstreamApp\")\r\n      .getOrCreate()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen running on Spark Yarn cluster mode, the driver is unable to pass 'spark.log.callerContext' to Yarn client and AM since Yarn client and AM have already started before the driver performs `.config(\"spark.log.callerContext\", \"infoSpecifiedByUpstreamApp\")`.\r\n\r\nThe following  example shows the command line used to submit a SparkKMeans application and the corresponding records in Yarn RM log and HDFS audit log.\r\n\r\nCommand:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit --verbose --executor-cores 3 --num-executors 1 --master yarn --deploy-mode client --class org.apache.spark.examples.SparkKMeans examples/target/original-spark-examples_2.11-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar hdfs://localhost:9000/lr_big.txt 2 5\r\n```\r\n\r\nYarn RM log:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently each data source OutputWriter is responsible for specifying the entire file name for each file output. This, however, does not make any sense because we rely on file naming schemes for certain behaviors in Spark SQL, e.g. bucket id. The current approach allows individual data sources to break the implementation of bucketing.\n\nOn the flip side, we also don't want to move file naming entirely out of data sources, because different data sources do want to specify different extensions.\n\nThis patch divides file name specification into two parts: the first part is a prefix specified by the caller of OutputWriter (in WriteOutput), and the second part is the suffix that can be specified by the OutputWriter itself. Note that a side effect of this change is that now all file based data sources also support bucketing automatically.\n\nThere are also some other minor cleanups:\n- Removed the UUID passed through generic Configuration string\n- Some minor rewrites for better clarity\n- Renamed \"path\" in multiple places to \"stagingDir\", to more accurately reflect its meaning\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis should be covered by existing data source tests.\n","created_at":"2016-10-20T06:19:36Z","updated_at":"2016-10-20T19:21:13Z","closed_at":"2016-10-20T19:21:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e91f495df4cf2f2b1d366361b720a782d2e61ee0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15562/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15562/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15562/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7aaded11ee34944310c22e11c036936c6647d9dd","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-18021","ref":"SPARK-18021","sha":"7aaded11ee34944310c22e11c036936c6647d9dd","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is proposed to solve the problem #14912 tried to solve before. Simply said, currently some predicates can not be correctly pushdown through operators due to its format is a bunch of ORs.\n\nA simple example is (a > 10) || (b > 2 && c == 3). If a datasource has attributes a and b, this filtering predicate cannot be pushdown. If we can convert it to CNF (a > 10 || b > 2) && (a > 10 || c == 3). Then we can push down (a > 10 || b > 2).\n\nTo convert the predicate to CNF format can solve this formally instead of a hacky way on #14912.\n\nWe have previous PRs for CNF conversion, such as #8200. Most of added tests in `CNFNormalizationSuite` are copied from #8200.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins tests.\n\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nallow ReplayListenerBus to skip deserialising and replaying certain events using an inexpensive check of the event log entry. Use this to ensure that when event log replay is triggered for building the application list, we get the ReplayListenerBus to skip over all but the few events needed for our immediate purpose.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch refactors WriterContainer to simplify the logic and make control flow more obvious.The previous code setup made it pretty difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, `SQLBuilder` handles `LIMIT` by always adding `LIMIT` at the end of the generated subSQL. It makes `RuntimeException`s like the following. This PR adds a parenthesis always except `SubqueryAlias` is used together with `LIMIT`.\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl(id INT)\")\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE VIEW v1(id2) AS SELECT id FROM tbl LIMIT 2\")\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to analyze the canonicalized SQL: ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n``` scala\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE TABLE tbl(id INT)\")\r\nscala> sql(\"CREATE VIEW v1(id2) AS SELECT id FROM tbl LIMIT 2\")\r\nscala> sql(\"SELECT id2 FROM v1\")\r\nres4: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [id2: int]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fixed cases in this PR**\r\n\r\nThe following two cases are the detail query plans having problematic SQL generations.\r\n\r\n1. `SELECT * FROM (SELECT id FROM tbl LIMIT 2)`\r\n\r\n    Please note that **FROM SELECT** part of the generated SQL in the below. When we don't use '()' for limit, this fails.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n# Original logical plan:\r\nProject [id#1]\r\n+- GlobalLimit 2\r\n   +- LocalLimit 2\r\n      +- Project [id#1]\r\n         +- MetastoreRelation default, tbl\r\n\r\n# Canonicalized logical plan:\r\nProject [gen_attr_0#1 AS id#4]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias tbl\r\n   +- Project [gen_attr_0#1]\r\n      +- GlobalLimit 2\r\n         +- LocalLimit 2\r\n            +- Project [gen_attr_0#1]\r\n               +- SubqueryAlias gen_subquery_0\r\n                  +- Project [id#1 AS gen_attr_0#1]\r\n                     +- SQLTable default, tbl, [id#1]\r\n\r\n# Generated SQL:\r\nSELECT `gen_attr_0` AS `id` FROM (SELECT `gen_attr_0` FROM SELECT `gen_attr_0` FROM (SELECT `id` AS `gen_attr_0` FROM `default`.`tbl`) AS gen_subquery_0 LIMIT 2) AS tbl\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. `SELECT * FROM (SELECT id FROM tbl TABLESAMPLE (2 ROWS))`\r\n\r\n    Please note that **((~~~) AS gen_subquery_0 LIMIT 2)** in the below. When we use '()' for limit on `SubqueryAlias`, this fails.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n# Original logical plan:\r\nProject [id#1]\r\n+- Project [id#1]\r\n   +- GlobalLimit 2\r\n      +- LocalLimit 2\r\n         +- MetastoreRelation default, tbl\r\n\r\n# Canonicalized logical plan:\r\nProject [gen_attr_0#1 AS id#4]\r\n+- SubqueryAlias tbl\r\n   +- Project [gen_attr_0#1]\r\n      +- GlobalLimit 2\r\n         +- LocalLimit 2\r\n            +- SubqueryAlias gen_subquery_0\r\n               +- Project [id#1 AS gen_attr_0#1]\r\n                  +- SQLTable default, tbl, [id#1]\r\n\r\n# Generated SQL:\r\nSELECT `gen_attr_0` AS `id` FROM (SELECT `gen_attr_0` FROM ((SELECT `id` AS `gen_attr_0` FROM `default`.`tbl`) AS gen_subquery_0 LIMIT 2)) AS tbl\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the Jenkins test with a newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently an unqualified `getFunction(..)`call returns a wrong result; the returned function is shown as temporary function without a database. For example:\n\n```\nscala> sql(\"create function fn1 as 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDFAbs'\")\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\n\nscala> spark.catalog.getFunction(\"fn1\")\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.catalog.Function = Function[name='fn1', className='org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.udf.generic.GenericUDFAbs', isTemporary='true']\n```\n\nThis PR fixes this by adding database information to ExpressionInfo (which is used to store the function information).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded more thorough tests to `CatalogSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-10-19T02:22:38Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T14:44:19Z","closed_at":"2016-11-01T14:44:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"049092614a77ef84fa9a03da4f87c4b442ab2cbf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15542/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15542/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15542/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e8d1a7e15b14e1b9799fd65d89797a337ef63c59","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-17996","ref":"SPARK-17996","sha":"e8d1a7e15b14e1b9799fd65d89797a337ef63c59","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nRestructure the code and implement two new task assigner.\nPackedAssigner: try to allocate tasks to the executors with least available cores, so that spark can release reserved executors when dynamic allocation is enabled.\n\nBalancedAssigner: try to allocate tasks to the executors with more available cores in order to balance the workload across all executors.\n\nBy default, the original round robin assigner is used.\n\nWe test a pipeline, and new PackedAssigner save around 45% regarding the reserved cpu and memory with dynamic allocation enabled.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\nBoth unit test in TaskSchedulerImplSuite and manual tests in production pipeline.\n","created_at":"2016-10-19T01:26:48Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T16:36:51Z","closed_at":"2018-10-22T05:33:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ccf328462e3560ba0df16834909f37aa0d28871e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15541/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15541/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15541/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ada2a45b43b9722bae99cf578b544195e69a1625","head":{"label":"zhzhan:TaskAssigner","ref":"TaskAssigner","sha":"ada2a45b43b9722bae99cf578b544195e69a1625","user":{"login":"zhzhan","id":4451616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4451616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan","html_url":"https://github.com/zhzhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22663923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjY2MzkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"zhzhan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhzhan","id":4451616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4451616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan","html_url":"https://github.com/zhzhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhzhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhzhan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn SPARK-16980, we removed the full in-memory cache of table partitions in favor of loading only needed partitions from the metastore. This greatly improves the initial latency of queries that only read a small fraction of table partitions.\n\nHowever, since the metastore does not store file statistics, we need to discover those from remote storage. With the loss of the in-memory file status cache this has to happen on each query, increasing the latency of repeated queries over the same partitions.\n\nThe proposal is to add back a per-table cache of partition contents, i.e. Map[Path, Array[FileStatus]]. This cache would be retained per-table, and can be invalidated through refreshTable() and refreshByPath(). Unlike the prior cache, it can be incrementally updated as new partitions are read.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests and new tests in `HiveTablePerfStatsSuite`.\n\ncc @mallman

For example, when querying parquet files written by Parquet-mr 1.6.0 Spark prints a torrent of (harmless) warning messages from the Parquet reader:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOct 18, 2016 7:42:18 PM WARNING: org.apache.parquet.CorruptStatistics: Ignoring statistics because created_by could not be parsed (see PARQUET-251): parquet-mr version 1.6.0\r\norg.apache.parquet.VersionParser$VersionParseException: Could not parse created_by: parquet-mr version 1.6.0 using format: (.+) version ((.*) )?\\(build ?(.*)\\)\r\n    at org.apache.parquet.VersionParser.parse(VersionParser.java:112)\r\n    at org.apache.parquet.CorruptStatistics.shouldIgnoreStatistics(CorruptStatistics.java:60)\r\n    at org.apache.parquet.format.converter.ParquetMetadataConverter.fromParquetStatistics(ParquetMetadataConverter.java:263)\r\n    at org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetFileReader$Chunk.readAllPages(ParquetFileReader.java:583)\r\n    at org.apache.parquet.hadoop.ParquetFileReader.readNextRowGroup(ParquetFileReader.java:513)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.VectorizedParquetRecordReader.checkEndOfRowGroup(VectorizedParquetRecordReader.java:270)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.VectorizedParquetRecordReader.nextBatch(VectorizedParquetRecordReader.java:225)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.VectorizedParquetRecordReader.nextKeyValue(VectorizedParquetRecordReader.java:137)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.RecordReaderIterator.hasNext(RecordReaderIterator.scala:39)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileScanRDD$$anon$1.hasNext(FileScanRDD.scala:102)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileScanRDD$$anon$1.nextIterator(FileScanRDD.scala:162)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileScanRDD$$anon$1.hasNext(FileScanRDD.scala:102)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIterator.scan_nextBatch$(Unknown Source)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIterator.processNext(Unknown Source)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator.hasNext(BufferedRowIterator.java:43)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenExec$$anonfun$8$$anon$1.hasNext(WholeStageCodegenExec.scala:372)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan$$anonfun$2.apply(SparkPlan.scala:231)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.SparkPlan$$anonfun$2.apply(SparkPlan.scala:225)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$mapPartitionsInternal$1$$anonfun$apply$24.apply(RDD.scala:803)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD$$anonfun$mapPartitionsInternal$1$$anonfun$apply$24.apply(RDD.scala:803)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.MapPartitionsRDD.compute(MapPartitionsRDD.scala:38)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.computeOrReadCheckpoint(RDD.scala:319)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD.iterator(RDD.scala:283)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask.runTask(ResultTask.scala:87)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:99)\r\n    at org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:282)\r\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n    at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n    at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis only happens during execution, not planning, and it doesn't matter what log level the `SparkContext` is set to. That's because Parquet (versions < 1.9) doesn't use slf4j for logging. Note, you can tell that log redirection is not working here because the log message format does not conform to the default Spark log message format.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression I noted as something we needed to fix as a follow up.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the problem arose because we removed the call to `inferSchema` during Hive table conversion. That call is what triggered the output redirection.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested this manually in four ways:\r\n1. Executing `spark.sqlContext.range(10).selectExpr(\"id as a\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"test\")`.\r\n2. Executing `spark.read.format(\"parquet\").load(legacyParquetFile).show` for a Parquet file `legacyParquetFile` written using Parquet-mr 1.6.0.\r\n3. Executing `select * from legacy_parquet_table limit 1` for some unpartitioned Parquet-based Hive table written using Parquet-mr 1.6.0.\r\n4. Executing `select * from legacy_partitioned_parquet_table where partcol=x limit 1` for some partitioned Parquet-based Hive table written using Parquet-mr 1.6.0.\r\n\r\nI ran each test with a new instance of `spark-shell` or `spark-sql`.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I found that test case 3 was not a regression—redirection was not occurring in the master codebase prior to #14690.\r\n\r\nI spent some time working on a unit test, but based on my experience working on this ticket I feel that automated testing here is far from feasible.\r\n\r\ncc @ericl

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to backport the fix https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15316 to 2.0.\n\nDataset always does eager analysis now. Thus, `spark.sql.eagerAnalysis` is not used any more. Thus, we need to remove it.\n\nThis PR also outputs the plan. Without the fix, the analysis error is like\n\n```\ncannot resolve '`k1`' given input columns: [k, v]; line 1 pos 12\n```\n\nAfter the fix, the analysis error becomes:\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve '`k1`' given input columns: [k, v]; line 1 pos 12;\n'Project [unresolvedalias(CASE WHEN ('k1 = 2) THEN 22 WHEN ('k1 = 4) THEN 44
