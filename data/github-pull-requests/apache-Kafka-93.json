patch fixes a liveness bug which prevents follower truncation from completing after a leader election. If there are consecutive leader elections without writing any data entries, then the leader and follower may have conflicting epoch entries at the end of the log. The JIRA explains a specific scenario in more detail: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10706.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the shortcut return in `Log.truncateTo` when the truncation offset is larger than or equal to the end offset, which prevents the conflicting entries from being resolved. Here we change this case to ensure `LeaderEpochFileCache.truncateFromEnd` is still called.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-20T22:17:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-07T11:47:08Z","closed_at":"2020-11-21T17:25:55Z","merged_at":"2020-11-21T17:25:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc96a8feb5dcd7f034a2c8f30282485a1fde5c67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/0e98ff6b2f3eb8aa160d794a3bc2be9b607ac73f","head":{"label":"hachikuji:KAFKA-10706","ref":"KAFKA-10706","sha":"0e98ff6b2f3eb8aa160d794a3bc2be9b607ac73f","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35842084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0MjA4NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"hachikuji/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji/kafka","description":"Mirror

topics can accumulate a large number of empty transaction markers as the data from the transactions gets cleaned. For each transaction, there is some bookkeeping that leaders and followers must do to keep the transaction index up to date. The cost of this overhead can degrade performance when a replica needs to catch up if the log has mostly empty or small transactions. This patch improves the cost by skipping over empty transactions since these will have no effect on the last stable offset and do not need to be reflected in the transaction index.\r\n\r\n###

patch follows up https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9547. It refactors KafkaApis, ReplicaManager and Partition to use `OffsetForLeaderPartitionResult` instead of `EpochEndOffset`. In the mean time, it removes `OffsetsForLeaderEpochRequest#epochsByTopicPartition` and `OffsetsForLeaderEpochResponse#responses` and replaces their usages to use the automated protocol directly. Finally, it removes old constructors in `OffsetsForLeaderEpochResponse`. The patch relies on existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-10746\r\n\r\nThis improvement is the side effect of this PR: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6972, where we tried to fix flooding number of warning messages but never left group case. So we move the warn logs into the `maybeLeaveGroup` method, and log as INFO level. (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/6972/files#diff-15efe9b844f78b686393b6c2e2ad61306c3473225742caed05c7edab9a138832L1092)\r\n\r\nThe INFO log is good when the leaving group is expected, ex: unsubscribe from all topics, consumer close... However, there are some cases that are unexpected, ex: polling timeout, taking too long to read the log, and these cases should be logged as WARN because some Kafka users ignore INFO messages or have the log level set to WARN. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

#9401, I observed some strange latency behavior when testing locally (on macos). The behavior seemed to be caused by slightly different write behavior as a result of the new `SendBuilder` class. After the change, we were making several calls down to both `GatheringByteChannel.write(ByteBuffer[])` as well as `WritableByteChannel.write(ByteBuffer)` whereas previously there would be just one path through the former. The difference is clearly seen in the flame graphs posted here: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9401#issuecomment-729258346. \r\n\r\nThis patch changes the grouping of `Send` objects created by `SendBuilder` to try and restore the previous write behavior. Rather than creating a single `ByteBufferSend` for each `ByteBuffer`, we attempt to group consecutive buffers into a single `ByteBufferSend`. I confirmed that did indeed address the latency issue I observed using the same test setup with a single broker that was discussed in #9401.\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic foo

use a background thread for Kerberos to perform re-login before tickets expire. The thread performs logout() followed by login(), relying on the Java library to clear and then populate credentials in Subject. This leaves a timing window where clients fail to authenticate because credentials are not available. We cannot introduce any form of locking since authentication is performed on the network thread. So this PR treats NO_CRED as a transient failure rather than a fatal authentication exception in clients.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

asynchronous shutdown in `LogManager` has the shortcoming that if during shutdown any of the internal futures fail, then we do not always ensure that all futures are completed before `LogManager.shutdown` returns. This is because, [this line](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/LogManager.scala#L502) in the `finally` clause shuts down the thread pools asynchronously. As a result, despite the `shut down completed` message from KafkaServer is seen in the error logs, some futures continue to run from inside `LogManager` attempting to close some logs. This is misleading during debugging. Also sometimes it introduces an avoidable post-shutdown activity where resources (such as file handles) are released or persistent state is checkpointed in the Broker.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we fix the above behavior such that we prevent leakage of threads. If any of the futures throw an error, we  skip creating of checkpoint and clean shutdown file only for the affected log directory. We continue to wait for all futures to complete for all the directories.\r\n\r\n**Test plan:**\r\n\r\nAdded a new unit test: `LogManager.testHandlingExceptionsDuringShutdown`.","created_at":"2020-11-15T01:59:13Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T18:52:18Z","closed_at":"2020-11-19T18:52:18Z","merged_at":"2020-11-19T18:52:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"dcbd28da53bfc6edb78fd1735993163fc6f4c7c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/9596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/9596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/8716429b48cad8af6ad73109c1d9f7442823c02f","head":{"label":"kowshik:KAFKA-10723_LogManager_shutdown_fix","ref":"KAFKA-10723_LogManager_shutdown_fix","sha":"8716429b48cad8af6ad73109c1d9f7442823c02f","user":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":239427959,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzk0Mjc5NTk=","name":"kafka","full_name":"kowshik/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kowshik","id":216151,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjE1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/216151?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik","html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kowshik/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kowshik/kafka","description":"Mirror

current behavior for KafkaConsumer.beginningOffsets on compacted topics is to always return offset 0. However, when looking at the record with the earliest timestamp in the log with KafkaConsumer.offsetsForTimes, the offset is nonzero. \r\n\r\nThis PR seeks to correct this issue by updating the segment baseOffsets and the logStartOffset during compaction. \r\nThe segment offset will be the offset of the first non-compacted batch, or the original baseOffset if the segment is empty. \r\nGenerally, all updates to logStartOffset must maintain the invariant logStartOffset <= end offset of first batch that can be returned by Fetch.\r\n\r\nThere are a few key changes/decisions to note that may not be immediately apparent:\r\n\r\n1. **Producer Snapshot Behavior** Currently the behavior of producer snapshots is that during compaction, if the segment offset of the producer snapshot file is not in the new segment offsets, the snapshot is deleted. This will lead to behavior like the following:\r\n\r\n- So for example we have segments with offsets 0 and 1, we want to delete first segment\r\nNew segment is base offset 0 so snapshot for segment 1 deleted. One segment, no snapshot files\r\n\r\nUnder this PR, the new behavior is this\r\n\r\n- We have segments with offsets 0 and 1, we want to delete first segment\r\nNew segment is base offset 1 so we don't delete snapshot. One segment, one snapshot file\r\n\r\nI was not sure if this is behavior we wanted, so I'm pointing it out.\r\n\r\n2.  **High Watermark Compaction** I wasn't sure if we allowed compaction past the high watermark. It seems like there is not a check to prevent it. I've added such a check for this PR.

default Mirror Maker 2 creates herders for all the possible combinations even if the \"links\" are not enabled.\r\n\r\nThis is because the beats are emitted from the \"opposite\" herder.\r\nIf there is a replication flow from A to B and heartbeats are required, 2 herders are needed :\r\n\r\n- A->B for the MirrorSourceConnector\r\n- B->A for the MirrorHeartbeatConnector\r\n\r\nThe MirrorHeartbeatConnector on B->A emits beats into topic heartbeats on cluster A.\r\nThe MirrorSourceConnector on A->B then replicates whichever topic is configured as well as heartbeats.\r\n\r\nIn cases with multiple clusters (10 and more), this leads to an incredible amount of connections, file descriptors and configuration topics created in every target clusters that are not necessary.\r\n\r\nWith this code change, we add a new top level property \"emit.heartbeats.enabled\" which defaults to \"true\".\r\nWe skip creating the A->B herder whenever A->B.emit.heartbeats.enabled=false (defaults to true) and A->B.enabled=false (defaults to false). \r\n\r\nExisting users will not see any change and if they depend on these \"opposites\" herders for their monitoring, it will still work.\r\nNew users with more complex use case can change this property and fine tune their heartbeat generation.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

to fix this on the side in order to more easily set up some experiments, so here's the PR.\r\n\r\nAllows a user to create multiple KStreams ~and/or KTables~ from the same topic, collection of topics, or pattern. At the moment this isn't possible since we can only consume from a topic once, and each source topic maps to a single source node in the topology. The \"fix\" is just to rewrite the logical plan and merge any duplicate source nodes into a single node before it gets compiled into the physical topology.\r\n\r\nThe one exception is when the stream/table are subscribed to an overlapping-but-unequal collection of topics, which I left as future work (with a TODO in the comments describing a possible solution). If the offset reset policy doesn't match we just throw a TopologyException.\r\n\r\nedit: tables are much more complicated so I opted to restrict things to just multiple KStreams for now on and consider allowing multiple KTables (or KStream+KTable) as followup

Since every resource pattern may have 100s or 1000s of access control entries associated with it, we don't want to log the entire contents on ACL update at INFO level. But it would be useful to log the resource pattern. This shows that we processed the notification in AclAuthorizer and gives the resource and version that was refreshed from ZK. This PR adds an additional INFO-level log entry for ACL updates in AclAuthorizer and retains the existing DEBUG level entry with full details.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

issue doesn't happen in java 8, but happen in java 11(not tested in java 15). In java 8, it'll throw parse Exception, but in java 11, it'll parse microseconds as milliseconds, ex: 001111 microseconds will be parsed as 1 second and 111 milliseconds. \r\n\r\nThis fix is to Strictly parse the date/time format by setLenient(false). So it won't allow un-matched date/time format input to avoid the wrong parsing for microseconds/nanoseconds. It'll throw parse Exception for any version s of java and be consistent.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

pieces:\r\n1) Fix bug in StreamSinkNode#writeToTopology to make sure it always calls the `addSink` overload with the specific topic name, when it exists, so that this topic gets tracked in the InternalTopologyBuilder's `nodeToSinkTopic` map. The sink topics are used by the StreamsPartitionAssignor to resolve the upstream subtopology of a repartition source topic, for whom that repartition topic will be a sink. Without this information the SPA gets stuck permanently during a rebalance\r\n2) Improve the SPA's `setRepartitionTopicMetadataNumberOfPartitions()` method to break out of the loop if we aren't making any progress, to avoid infinitely looping if we ever have another bug like KAFKA-10689. If the SPA hasn't updated the known partition numbers for any repartition topic in the current outer loop, then we know that it's stuck and should throw a TaskAssignmentException to shut down the

profile from a moderately busy cluster shows that calls to `protectedListener` can make up more than 1% of the allocations on a broker.\r\n\r\n`config.interBrokerListenerName` is a relatively expensive call that both makes a copy of the `KafkaConfig`'s backing map and performs string/regex parsing. Given that we call `protectedListener()` multiple times per call to `ConnectionQuotas.inc()`, we end up performing a lot of unnecessary allocations, particularly given that the inter broker listener is not reconfigurable. We can instead store the inter broker listener name and check against it rather than recompute from the config.\r\n\r\nAn additional, smaller optimization included is to check the size of listener counts instead of `config.listeners`, as `config.listeners()` does some additional string csv parsing to recompute the listeners each time.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

the code necessary for the leader to response to fetch snapshot requests and for the follower to fetch snapshots. It depends on PR https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/9512 and that PR should be reviewed first. Included are the following changes.\r\n\r\nLeader Changes:\r\n1. Raft leader response to FetchSnapshot request by reading the local snapshot and sending the requested bytes in the response. This implementation currently copies the bytes to memory. This will be fixed in a future PR.\r\n\r\nFollower Changes:\r\n1. Raft followers will start fetching snapshot if the leader sends a Fetch response that includes a SnapshotId.\r\n\r\n2. Raft followers send FetchSnapshot requests if there is a pending download. The same timer is used for both Fetch and FetchSnapshot requests.\r\n\r\n3. Raft follower handle FetchSnapshot responses by comping the bytes to the pending SnapshotWriter. This implementation doesn't fix the replicated log after the snapshot has been downloaded. This will be implemented in a future PR.\r\n \r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary. The PR title and PR message become\r\nthe squashed commit message, so use a separate\r\ncomment to ping reviewers.*\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

the Scala compiler was configured to inline all usages of\r\nsymbols in under the `scala` package. This is problematic because it\r\nmeans that published Kafka jars must run with the exact same version of\r\nthe Scala library that the Kafka jar was compiled with.  If the runtime\r\nuses a different version of the Scala library then users risk getting a\r\ncrash like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: scala/math/Ordering$$anon$7\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit disables inlining from the `scala` package to prevent\r\ncrashes like this. The downside to this change is it may introduce\r\nperformance regressions.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify
