Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12997](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12997) Corrects the location of the AWS STS Version 2 library, moving it from `nifi-aws-processors` to `nifi-aws-service-api` where it will be available in the same ClassLoader as the AWS Auth Version 2 library for runtime credential loading. This change aligns with the current location of the AWS STS Version 1 library, already included in `nifi-aws-service-api`.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include declaring `nifi-aws-service-api` as provided at the bundle level to avoid unnecessary repetition, and marking the STS and Auth libraries as provided in `nifi-aws-nar` to avoid unnecessary inclusion.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12988](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12988) Reduces the number of dependencies in `nifi-iceberg-test-utils`, such as several Hadoop-related dependencies that have no direct or indirect references.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-iceberg-processors` module is the only reference to `nifi-iceberg-test-utils`. Changes to `nifi-iceberg-processors` Maven configuration include explicitly listing `derby` to align with the version of `derbytools` already included, and excluding an unnecessary dependency on Hadoop Yarn Server.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12981](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12981) Removes Apache Hive 3 components in `nifi-hive-bundle` and relocates shared test utilities to `nifi-iceberg-test-utils`.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include updating documentation to remove references to the `include-hive3` profile, and adding a transitive dependency exclusion in `nifi-code-coverage`. The exclusions is necessary to avoid Maven Enforcer Plugin warnings related to the inclusion of legacy versions of the Bouncy Castle library from Hadoop 3.4.0.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-7085](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-7085)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds batching to PublishJMS and ConsumeJMS in the form of a new property. ConsumeJMS can read more than one message from the JMS broker per triggered task. PublishJMS can publish more than one flowFile to the JMS broker per triggered task. This helps get higher message throughput to JMS in busy NiFi environments.\r\n\r\nThe SupportsBatching annotation was considered, but it is not appropriate for processors that send/receive data from an external source.\r\n\r\nThe new Maximum Batch Size property has a default value of 1, to match old behavior. ConsumeJMS in record processing mode used to have a 10,000 max batch size which is replaced by this property value. ConsumeJMS will migrate the new Maximum Batch Size property to 10000 if it was not set and it was in record processing mode.\r\n\r\nFixed an bug in JMSConsumer:consumeMessageSet where it could read, but not acknowledge or commit, an extra message when batchCounter = MAX_MESSAGES_PER_FLOW_FILE\r\n\r\nFixed JMSPublisherConsumerIT integration test which didn't account for when consumeMessage() did not read a message.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12962](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12962) Upgrades Spring Framework dependencies from 6.0.18 to [6.1.5](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v6.1.5) aligning the project root version with the current version used in NiFi Registry.\r\n\r\nThis upgrade required enabling the [parameters](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/specs/man/javac.html#option-parameters) option for the Java compiler in the `nifi-web-api` module. Enabling parameters supports runtime reflection and parameter name determination, which supports existing AspectJ Around expressions that require mapping expression arguments to method arguments. This approach follows the recommendation of the Spring Framework documentation for [explicit argument names](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop/ataspectj/advice.html#aop-ataspectj-advice-params-names-explicit) and avoids the need to define and repeat the argument names in the annotations.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12945](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12945) Moves the Apache Commons Configuration dependency declaration from `nifi-lookup-services` to the root project configuration for shared dependency version management. This change aligns with similar changes for other Apache Commons modules, ensuring that the same version is applied to all extension components.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include moving the Google Guava version from the `nifi-hive-test-utils` to the `nifi-hive-bundle` to ensure the same version is applied to all Hive components.\r\n\r\nThis change applies to the main branch, and a separate pull request will be needed for the support branch to clean up additional references to Commons Configuration.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12943](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12943) Upgrades Apache Hadoop dependencies from 3.3.6 to [3.4.0](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.4.0/index.html) to incorporate numerous bug fixes, improvements, and transitive dependency upgrades.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade to 3.4.0 requires excluding the `bcprov-jdk15on` library and including the `bcprov-jdk18on` due to Bouncy Castle coordinate renaming on more recent versions. This libraries have the same major version number and contain incremental updates, and this approach aligns with similar changes for other modules.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-5302](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-5302) Adds supports for the [OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Flow](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/) when NiFi is configured for [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html) authentication.\r\n\r\nThe implementation changes maintain existing support for the [Authorization Code Grant Flow](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/server-side-apps/authorization-code/) as part of standard browser-based access, but enable machine-to-machine authentication using Client Credentials. Most of the code changes involve reorganizing the OIDC and JWT configuration objects for reuse between configuration classes.\r\n\r\nThe configuration changes support verifying Access Tokens based on the provided Issuer claim. When the Token Issuer matches the OIDC Client Registration Issuer, NiFi uses the Identity Provider signing key for verification. In all other cases, NiFi uses the existing application signing key for verification, maintaining current behavior.\r\n\r\nEnabling machine-to-machine access with the Client Credentials Flow may also require authorization configuration changes depending on the deployed environment. The OpenID Connect fallback claims identifying user property may also be necessary to use the `sub` claim as the identity instead of the default `email` claim. These configuration elements can be enabled using existing configuration properties and do not require additional code changes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps
