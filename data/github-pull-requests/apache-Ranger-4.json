What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the versions of ranger plugins and services(including ranger usersync and ranger tagsync) present as part of the respective ranger-service images are based on the ranger admin version whereas they can have their own versions independent of ranger admin version. This will allow ranger plugins to interact with ranger while being on different versions.\r\n\r\nfor ex: ranger-hadoop and ranger-hive images run with plugin version 2.2.0 whereas ranger-admin image runs with version 2.3.0.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Tested the docker containers with version 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT for all plugins.\r\n- Tested the docker containers with these versions:\r\n```\r\n# versions of ranger services\r\nRANGER_VERSION=3.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\nKMS_VERSION=3.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\nUSERSYNC_VERSION=2.4.0\r\nTAGSYNC_VERSION=2.4.0\r\n\r\n# plugin versions\r\nHDFS_PLUGIN_VERSION=2.3.0\r\nYARN_PLUGIN_VERSION=2.3.0\r\nHIVE_PLUGIN_VERSION=2.3.0\r\nHBASE_PLUGIN_VERSION=3.0.0-SNAPSHOT\r\nKAFKA_PLUGIN_VERSION=2.3.0\r\nKNOX_PLUGIN_VERSION=2.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- All containers come up fine\r\n- Test connection successful\r\n- Policies synced to plugin(seen from Plugins tab in ranger UI)\r\n\r\n- Versions across containers visible here:\r\n```\r\nuser@localhost ranger % docker ps -q | xargs -I {} docker inspect --format='{{range .Config.Env}}{{println .}}{{end}}' {} | grep \"_VERSION\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nRanger usersync regards the forward slash ('/') as a separator character in the regex so it ignores it if you actually want to use it in your groupname. e.g. RRR/group_name_suffix (/ can be potentially used as a domain separator in AD groups)\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing a different character like + in the regex works to get something like RRR+group_name_suffix but not RRR/group_name_suffix.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for the new feature.\r\nmvn clean package on ugsync module.\r\n\r\nTested the changes on a cluster with these additional usersync configs with LDAP sync source:\r\n\r\nname: ranger.usersync.mapping.regex.separator\r\nvalue: #\r\n\r\nname:

[RANGER-3938](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-3938)\r\nLets say for ranger audit, we configure an elasticsearch alias(rollover alias). And if there are 2 or more indices for an alias then audit API doesn't work. Because while fetching the records, ranger uses multi get request on an alias. \r\nIt results in below error:\r\n```\r\nAlias [alias-name] has more than one indices associated with it [[index-000002, index-000001]], can't execute a single index op\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Code snippet](https://github.com/apache/ranger/blob/6c8a142881896f2c6d1696bcee02c401867a45f9/security-admin/src/main/java/org/apache/ranger/elasticsearch/ElasticSearchUtil.java#L175-L180):\r\n```\r\n        MultiGetRequest multiGetRequest = new MultiGetRequest();\r\n        for (SearchHit hit : hits) {\r\n            MultiGetRequest.Item item = new MultiGetRequest.Item(index, null, hit.getId());\r\n            item.fetchSourceContext(FetchSourceContext.FETCH_SOURCE);\r\n            multiGetRequest.add(item);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo there can be 2 possible approaches to resolve this:\r\n\r\n- #### Approach 1(Quick and fast) [THIS MERGE REQUEST HAS THIS FIX]:\r\nUse hit.getIndex() instead of index(in this case its has alias) for a MultiGetRequest.Item object.\r\nSo that all the documents can be get by id with its index only instead of alias.\r\n\r\n- #### Approach 2(Change the MultiGet to search) [NOT PART OF THIS MERGE REQUEST]:\r\n```\r\nPOST /_search\r\n{\r\n    \"query\": {\r\n        \"ids\" : {\r\n            \"values\" : [\"id1\", \"id2\"]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease review.","created_at":"2022-10-03T08:08:29Z","updated_at":"2022-10-11T16:34:03Z","closed_at":"2022-10-06T07:46:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e07b74e1322848fec7a82d70967500a67ba045e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/177/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/177/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/177/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/statuses/d01b588c529a3a9df5748ba02f02a80cfe53aca1","head":{"label":"sumannewton:ranger-3938-es-alias-support-audit","ref":"ranger-3938-es-alias-support-audit","sha":"d01b588c529a3a9df5748ba02f02a80cfe53aca1","user":{"login":"sumannewton","id":13970228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTcwMjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13970228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton","html_url":"https://github.com/sumannewton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140030231,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDAwMzAyMzE=","name":"ranger","full_name":"sumannewton/ranger","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sumannewton","id":13970228,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTcwMjI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13970228?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton","html_url":"https://github.com/sumannewton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumannewton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sumannewton/ranger","description":"Mirror

Issue\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/RANGER-3787\r\n\r\nWhen using [kyuubi-spark-authz plugin](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kyuubi/tree/master/extensions/spark/kyuubi-spark-authz) (which extends RangerBasePlugin) to save audit log to ElasticSearch in Spark application, I found that if Spark application was submitted in local or client mode, it hanged forever even after main thread exited. But if I turn off `xasecure.audit.destination.elasticsearch`, Spark application exits normally.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nBy default, if ThreadFactory is not set, `RestHighLevelClient` uses `Executors.defaultThreadFactory()` to create http connection threads, which are non-daemon threads. We provide a ThreadFactory which creates daemon threads to override the default behavior.\r\n","created_at":"2022-06-14T03:04:06Z","updated_at":"2022-06-14T13:08:50Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/151/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/151/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/issues/151/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/ranger/statuses/2be0667fbd439a926b3c777c712104a9909d1017","head":{"label":"zhouyifan279:RANGER-3787","ref":"RANGER-3787","sha":"2be0667fbd439a926b3c777c712104a9909d1017","user":{"login":"zhouyifan279","id":88070094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDcwMDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88070094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouyifan279","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503181144,"node_id":"R_kgDOHf3vWA","name":"ranger","full_name":"zhouyifan279/ranger","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhouyifan279","id":88070094,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MDcwMDk0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/88070094?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouyifan279","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouyifan279/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhouyifan279/ranger","description":"Mirror
