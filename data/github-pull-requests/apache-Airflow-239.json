a new command to the Airflow CLI.\r\n``` bash\r\nairflow kubernetes pod-preview dag-id --sub-dir\r\n```\r\nThe idea is to be able to generate pod templates from KubernetesPodOperator, so given a target dag it can generate all the k8s pod templates and printing in the CLI.\r\n\r\nExample.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25264748/77898454-6e94a280-727b-11ea-8ca3-64141e02b040.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25264748/77898528-91bf5200-727b-11ea-9847-50f454f3a879.png)\r\n\r\nJust one consideration I am not connecting to any Kubernetes client so I am generating a default service account which means that you can not launch this pod in a Kubernetes cluster with a command like this.\r\n```\r\nkubectl apply -f file.yaml\r\n```\r\nAny feedback here is appreciated.\r\n\r\nAlso to be able to test this feature I need to add a new example-dag, \r\n``` bash\r\nexample_kubernetes_pod_operator.py\r\n```\r\nIt is the same example given by Google in their composer tutorial (https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/using/using-kubernetes-pod-operator), but adapting the imports to the new Kubernetes module import system.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: WILL BE INSERTED

link: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/7905\r\n\r\nCurrently on master, pandas is pinned to < 1.0.0 in Airflow's dependencies. Version 1.0 was released in October 31, 2019. Lots of projects are starting to migrate to pandas 1.0 and it will gradually become more and more difficult to solve conflicts between their dependencies and Airflow's dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis PR increases the max version of pandas to `2.0`, which will allow installing pandas 1.0. The minimum pandas version stays unchanged so all existing projects with pandas version pinned to `1.0` shouldn't be impacted.\r\n\r\nMy commit passed the pre-commits. I installed (or tried to) installed as much dependencies as possible in the `all` extra (in a local virtualenv), and ran as much unit tests as possible before upgrading pandas. This was my baseline. I then upgraded pandas to 1.0.3 and ran the same tests again and the number of failed tests didn't decrease.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I can't give a clearer answer on whether pandas' version will break something, but testing has proven to be difficult: the integration tests are tangled with the unit tests and it's unclear to me which tests should pass or not. Help is appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\n- [x] Commits follow \"[How to

use model polymorphism in `airflow.jobs` classes, so we must load all classes each time. \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs/base_job.py#L65-L73\r\nOtherwise, SQLAlchemy will not be able to execute the queries correctly.\r\n```\r\n    def configure_subclass_mapper(discriminator):\r\n        try:\r\n            sub_mapper = mapper.polymorphic_map[discriminator]\r\n        except KeyError:\r\n            raise AssertionError(\r\n>               \"No such polymorphic_identity %r is defined\" % discriminator\r\n            )\r\nE           AssertionError: No such polymorphic_identity 'LocalTaskJob' is defined\r\n```\r\nSo, in order not to load a lot of code, we should divide these classes into smaller ones. I think it won't be a problem to separate the loops (BackfillLoop, SchedulerLoop, LocalTaskJob) from the entity model. However, I would like to do it later. For now I am proposing a temporary solution. Loading all classes every time.\r\n\r\nThis problem does not appear in CI tests, because then we load all classes. It also does not occur in real situations, because the current coupling of all classes causes that these models are loaded anyway, but it blocks refactoring.This makes it difficult to eliminate coupling between classes. In particular, it prevents me from completing this change.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/7806\r\nThe problem sometimes occurs when running individual tests.\r\n\r\nI'm using the following code to check the impact of this change on Airflow.\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\r\n\r\n\r\nclass TraceImportResult:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.new_modules = None\r\n\r\n    def print_new_modules(self):\r\n        for i, new_module in enumerate(sorted(trace_resuslt.new_modules)):\r\n            print(f\"{i}. {new_module}\")\r\n\r\n\r\n@contextmanager\r\ndef trace_imports():\r\n    before_modules = set(sys.modules.keys())\r\n    result = TraceImportResult()\r\n\r\n    try:\r\n        yield result\r\n    finally:\r\n        after_modules = set(sys.modules.keys())\r\n        before_count = len(before_modules)\r\n        after_count = len(after_modules)\r\n        diff_count = after_count - before_count\r\n        result.new_modules = after_modules - before_modules\r\n        print(f\"Modules loaded - before: {before_count}\")\r\n        print(f\"Modules loaded - after:  {after_count}\")\r\n        print(f\"Modules loaded - diff:   {diff_count}\")\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    # Example:\r\n\r\n    with trace_imports() as trace_resuslt:\r\n

disable=unused-import\r\n\r\n    trace_resuslt.print_new_modules()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe learn from this that adding these imports will cause that an additional 32 modules will be loaded each time the code `import airflow.jobs` is executed.\r\n```\r\n0. airflow.executors\r\n1. airflow.executors.base_executor\r\n2. airflow.executors.executor_loader\r\n3. airflow.executors.local_executor\r\n4. airflow.executors.sequential_executor\r\n5. airflow.jobs\r\n6. airflow.jobs.backfill_job\r\n7. airflow.jobs.base_job\r\n8. airflow.jobs.local_task_job\r\n9. airflow.jobs.scheduler_job\r\n10.

5\r\n``import airflow.jobs.scheduler_job `` - 31\r\n``import airflow.jobs.backfill_job`` - 11\r\n``import airflow.jobs.local_task_job`` - 24\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: WILL BE INSERTED BY
