To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(This is a small code refactor which also can be reused by following PRs.  Extract header fields of Buffer into a BufferHeader class for blocking shuffle file IO)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Extract header fields of Buffer into a BufferHeader class for blocking shuffle file IO*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *BufferReaderWriterUtilTest*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / (**no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, in each index entry of sort-shuffle index file, one field is the number of buffers in the current data region. The problem is that it is hard to know the data boundary before reading the file, to solve the problem, we can store the number of bytes instead of the number of buffers in the index entry. \r\n\r\nBased on this change, we can do some optimization, for example, read a larger size of data than a buffer for better sequential IO like what's mentioned in [FLINK-28373](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-28373).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Store the number of bytes instead of the number of buffers in index entry for sort-shuffle*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *PartitionedFileWriteReadTest*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, for sort blocking shuffle, the corresponding data reader always allocates a fixed size of 8M buffers for shuffle data reading. [FLINK-28373](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-28373) can increase buffer utilization, after which, we can reduce the buffer size per request to reduce the time waiting for buffers.\r\n\r\nThis change decreases the memory size per request for sort-shuffle data read from 8M to 4M.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Decrease the memory size per request for sort-shuffle data read from 8M to 4M*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *SortMergeResultPartitionReadSchedulerTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd add_months(startDate, numMonths) SQL function.\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n> SELECT add_months('2016-08-31', 1);\r\n 2016-09-30\r\n> SELECT add_months('2016-08-31', -6);\r\n 2016-02-29 \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add addMonths method to DateTimeUtils.java\r\n- Add related expression, convert rule, and code gen.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as TemporalTypesTest#testAddMonths.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the SortMergeResultPartitionReadScheduler always gets all active subpartition readers and read at most one data region for them. It is common that some subpartitions are requested before others and their region indexes are ahead of others. \r\n\r\nIf all region data of a subpartition can be read in one round, some subpartition readers will always be ahead of others which will cause random IO. \r\n\r\nThis patch fixes this case by polling one subpartition reader at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Fix the bug that SortMergeResultPartitionReadScheduler may not read data sequentially.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *SortMergeResultPartitionReadSchedulerTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-20T09:55:45Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T11:56:02Z","closed_at":"2022-07-29T11:56:02Z","merged_at":"2022-07-29T11:56:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"f88489a6af42638679429df3fdb4818c278cacbf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/46a706b77b69270af1f441148020f067710ec5ac","head":{"label":"TanYuxin-tyx:FLINK-28519","ref":"FLINK-28519","sha":"46a706b77b69270af1f441148020f067710ec5ac","user":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":383718803,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM3MTg4MDM=","name":"flink","full_name":"TanYuxin-tyx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n[FLINK-27292](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-27292)\r\nTranslate the \"Data Type Extraction\" section of \"Data Types\" to Chinese.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nTranslate the \"Data Type Extraction\" section of \"Data Types\" to Chinese, the doc file is located in\r\n'docs/content.zh/docs/dev/table/types.md'\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the SortMergeResultPartition selects to use HashBasedDataBuffer and SortBasedDataBuffer based on the number of required buffers per result partition decided by `taskmanager.network.sort-shuffle.min-buffers`. If the configured value is large enough, HashBasedDataBuffer will be used, otherwise, SortBasedDataBuffer will be used. Usually, the HashBasedDataBuffer has better performance. However, it is not easy to tune this value, because if a user tries to increase it for better performance, he/she is easy to encounter the 'Insufficient number of network buffers' error. \r\n\r\nThis patch improves this case by selecting HashBasedDataBuffer and SortBasedDataBuffer dynamically based on the number of network buffers that can be allocated. More specifically, if there are enough buffers at runtime, HashBasedDataBuffer will be used, otherwise, SortBasedDataBuffer will be used. To achieve better performance, the user only needs to increase the total amount of network memory per task manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Select HashBasedDataBuffer and SortBasedDataBuffer dynamically based on the number of network buffers that can be allocated for SortMergeResultPartition*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *SortMergeResultPartitionTest, DataBufferTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR limits checkpoint discard delay in CLAIM restore mode (FLINK-25872) to two cases:\r\n1. Changelog (off -> on). Adjust `SharedStateRegsitry` API to make it explicit that the state to register must prevent deletion of the checkpoint created it (i.e. initial checkpoint). This only takes effect when referring to the initial checkpoint state.\r\n2. RocksDB Incr. Native Savepoint. Rely on `SharingFilesStrategy` of the restored savepoint to determine whether any shared state can reside inside the `chk-xx` folder (rather than `/shared`).\r\n\r\n`SharingFilesStrategy` is a proxy to scope and therefore (SST) files location in terms of code.\r\nConceptually, it also seems the right property of the checkpoint to analyze.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew tests in `SharedStateRegistryTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd nvl(expr1, expr2) SQL function.\r\nExamples:\r\n```sql\r\n> SELECT nvl(NULL, 2);\r\n 2\r\n> SELECT nvl(3, 2);\r\n 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Add nvl method to NvlFunction.java and NvlTypeStrategy.java\r\n - Add related expression, convert rule, and code gen.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as ScalarFunctionsTest#testNvl.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving): (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (docs )\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-19T09:41:20Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T12:06:19Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20310/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20310/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20310/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c354e31aa3c04e2926f65928c425d2a5bf24515b","head":{"label":"zzzzzzzs:FLINK-26949","ref":"FLINK-26949","sha":"c354e31aa3c04e2926f65928c425d2a5bf24515b","user":{"login":"zzzzzzzs","id":25766626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzY2NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25766626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzzs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":390586620,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTA1ODY2MjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"zzzzzzzs/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zzzzzzzs","id":25766626,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzY2NjI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25766626?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs","html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzzs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zzzzzzzs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zzzzzzzs/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe reset on the underlying collector of TableFunctionCollector is unnecessary and confusing. We can remove it. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove unnecessary reset on underlying collector of TableFunctionCollector\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-19T09:13:14Z","updated_at":"2022-07-20T02:36:43Z","closed_at":"2022-07-20T02:36:40Z","merged_at":"2022-07-20T02:36:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"674d8850db1719dd403269e07e6248d2083a0c9d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/10dff36b59cf38c1a3ef01c67a45e79064526be9","head":{"label":"wuchong:TableFunctionCollector","ref":"TableFunctionCollector","sha":"10dff36b59cf38c1a3ef01c67a45e79064526be9","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63797485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5NzQ4NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"wuchong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently, the number of IO threads for shuffle data reading is relevant to the size of reading memory and the number of CPU cores. We should also consider the number of slots and the number of disks.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Restrict the number of threads for sort-shuffle data read*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *SharedPoolNettyShuffleServiceFactory*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-19T08:25:40Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T03:24:16Z","closed_at":"2022-07-21T03:24:16Z","merged_at":"2022-07-21T03:24:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f76a30569332728def4df0c316ee1a4f3409aa9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272992952,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkyOTUy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Network","name":"component=Runtime/Network","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20308/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20308/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20308/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9c70d77f78177570f557ffa85c092ddca6611e91","head":{"label":"TanYuxin-tyx:FLINK-28376","ref":"FLINK-28376","sha":"9c70d77f78177570f557ffa85c092ddca6611e91","user":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":383718803,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM3MTg4MDM=","name":"flink","full_name":"TanYuxin-tyx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"TanYuxin-tyx","id":20889547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwODg5NTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20889547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx","html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TanYuxin-tyx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/TanYuxin-tyx/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nYARN is trying to renew the Hadoop FS tokens at the initial job submit phase. The success of this renew is depending on YARN configuration. Namely token must be obtained with the appropriate renewer which is not yet possible to configure. In this PR I've added `security.kerberos.token.provider.hadoofs.renewer` config possiblity.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Added new config possibility for token renewer\r\n* Added unit tests\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* New unit tests.\r\n* Manually on cluster.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes output stream of StateChangeFsUploader could be closed normally while enbaling compression.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Always call close in StateChangeFsUploader#upload while enabling compression\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added StateChangeFsUploaderTest#testCompress\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-19T07:08:43Z","updated_at":"2022-07-29T06:50:19Z","closed_at":"2022-07-29T06:50:19Z","merged_at":"2022-07-29T06:50:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"e77d3a226bab6d06272976a742c225811dc3ca36","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fb371037a4ad1e1805dadc4ec37efe34569662bd","head":{"label":"masteryhx:FLINK-28602","ref":"FLINK-28602","sha":"fb371037a4ad1e1805dadc4ec37efe34569662bd","user":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":436096625,"node_id":"R_kgDOGf5OcQ","name":"flink","full_name":"masteryhx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor some join cases, like `SELECT * FROM T1 LEFT OUTER JOIN T2 ON a = c LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT * FROM T3) ON a = e`, tables `T1`, `T2` and `T3` can be translated to a multi join set because of changing their order can get the same join results. However, now, flink use calcite's default `JOIN_TO_MULTI_JOIN`  rule, this rule will not put any outer join in the same multi join set.\r\n\r\nSo, this pr is aims to add `FlinkJoinToMultiJoinRule` to support translating left/outer join to one multi join set while they meet correct conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adding new rule  `FlinkJoinToMultiJoinRule`. \r\n- Adding more test cases in `FlinkJoinToMultiJoinRuleTest` to verify left/right outer join.\r\n- Adding a new plan test `MultiJoinOptimizeTest` to verify the join results after join reorder.\r\n \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Adding more test cases in `FlinkJoinToMultiJoinRuleTest`.\r\n- Adding a new plan test `MultiJoinOptimizeTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n```\r\nNewly created checkpoints can be discarded right after subsumption. But the\r\ninitial checkpoint needs to be kept until all of its private AND shared state\r\nis not in use.\r\nKeeping any checkpoint for longer leaves its folder undeleted on job\r\ncancellation (and also on crash or JM failover).\r\n\r\nThis change limits createdByCheckpointID tracking to only initial checkpoints.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n**TBD**\r\n\r\n## Does this pull

Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Allow to submit sql for HiveServer2 Endopint.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove useless HandleIdentifier*\r\n  - *Allow execute sql and fetch results from the HiveServer2 endpoint*\r\n  - *Expose RowDataToString converter in the ResultSet for serialization*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for all kinds of Flink SQL*\r\n  - *Added tests to serialize all kinds of supported DataTypes.*\r\n  - *Added negative test cases for RowData with DELETE/UPDATE*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-18T12:01:39Z","updated_at":"2023-08-09T08:18:27Z","closed_at":"2022-07-29T02:01:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bfe05c988931cbd364a4ec27396a143f55ecb344","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20298/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20298/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20298/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c02b97a76c9f6e39188fb414fc481a9518a499ef","head":{"label":"fsk119:hiveserver2-statement","ref":"hiveserver2-statement","sha":"c02b97a76c9f6e39188fb414fc481a9518a499ef","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up step of FLIP-168 and FLIP-224, the Flink Web UI needs to be enhanced to display the related information if the speculative execution mechanism is enabled. This PR is introducing the changes of REST APIs.\r\n\r\nNote: Commits except the last one is for Blocklist Mechanism, and will be removed once its related pull requests are merged.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - A \"other-concurrent-attempts\" field is added to SubtaskExecutionAttemptDetailsInfo and SubtaskBackPressureInfo, to hold the information of other concurrent attempts other than the fastest one.\r\n  - Count of blocked task managers and slots is added to the ResourceOverview.\r\n  - Blocked flag is added to the TaskManagerInfo, indicating if the task manager is blocked.\r\n  - MetricStore is modified to hold the metrics of more than one current execution attempt.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by running all unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Remove the unused field in SortMergeSubpartitionReader*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove the unused field in SortMergeSubpartitionReader*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Remove the data flush in SortMergeResultPartition because it is useless.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Remove the data flush in SortMergeResultPartition because it is useless.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *SortMergeResultPartitionTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nDo not update the lastUsedCheckpointID of PlaceholderStreamStateHandle.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *SharedStateRegistryTest#testUnregisterPlaceholderState()*\r\n  - *SharedStateRegistryTest#testUnregisterUnusedState()*\r\n \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-18T05:44:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T02:57:49Z","closed_at":"2022-07-20T03:23:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"22a9197ef1d8b74718b2482966c7ddb4d9c8d6b4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20291/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20291/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20291/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ec14548e64af7968fa93bf1d9e6c0599cb3a6b07","head":{"label":"fredia:FLINK-28581","ref":"FLINK-28581","sha":"ec14548e64af7968fa93bf1d9e6c0599cb3a6b07","user":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":375962860,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzU5NjI4NjA=","name":"flink","full_name":"fredia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fredia","id":18653940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUzOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18653940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia","html_url":"https://github.com/fredia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fredia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fredia/flink","description":"Apache

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport dynamic stop position in FileSource\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added a new interface `DynamicHybridSourceReader` interface to allow implementor to participate dynamic initialization\r\n  - implementation is added for `SourceReaderBase` so most reader can participate automatically\r\n- The high-level mechanism works as follow:\r\n  - On each checkpoint, `HybridSourceReader` retrieve the finished states (marked with `HybridSourceSplit.isFinished = true`) from the underlying reader and checkpoint them for persistent along with the unfinished states. \r\n  - Upon source switch, `HybridSourceReader` will send all the finished splits in `SourceReaderFinishedEvent` to the enumerator. \r\n  - Enumerator will pass along those finished splits to in `SourceSwitchContext` to the next source.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Current test cases pass\r\n- Test split serialization backward compatibility \r\n- Adjust one existing test case to check `SourceSwitchContext` has the correct finished splits from the previous source\r\n- TODO: plan to add more tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? : should add documentation after change signed off\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-17T03:52:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T12:06:16Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tweise","id":263695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MzY5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/263695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise","html_url":"https://github.com/tweise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tweise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273335481,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM1NDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/FileSystem","name":"component=Connectors/FileSystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/470583f9a46bf94ec00b4e5d77c79b942b2d377a","head":{"label":"xinbinhuang:binh/dynamic-hybrid-source","ref":"binh/dynamic-hybrid-source","sha":"470583f9a46bf94ec00b4e5d77c79b942b2d377a","user":{"login":"xinbinhuang","id":27927454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTI3NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27927454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/xinbinhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355076846,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTUwNzY4NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"xinbinhuang/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinbinhuang","id":27927454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3OTI3NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27927454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang","html_url":"https://github.com/xinbinhuang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinbinhuang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinbinhuang/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-15T09:55:03Z","updated_at":"2025-01-15T12:06:13Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20284/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20284/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20284/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1aa53498cc93c049d76c79d9a67a6771d0a5ed0f","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:FLINK-27850","ref":"FLINK-27850","sha":"1aa53498cc93c049d76c79d9a67a6771d0a5ed0f","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn order to minimize the potential exceptions or data errors when many users use the update stream to lookup join an external table (essentially due to the non-deterministic result based on processing-time to lookup external tables). \r\nWhen update exists in the input stream and the lookup key does not contain the primary key of the external table,\r\nFLINK automatically adds materialization of the update by default, so that it will only lookup the external table when the insert or update_after message arrives, and when the delete or update_before message arrives, it will directly querying the latest version of the locally materialized data and sent it to downstream operator.\r\n\r\nTo do so，we introduce a new option 'table.exec.lookup-join.upsert-materialize' and resue the `UpsertMaterialize`. By default, the materialize operator will be added when an update stream lookup an external table without containing its primary keys(includes no primary key defined).

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nNow, the operator events sent from a coordinator to its subtasks would be temporarily blocked when the coordinator starts checkpointing and be unblocked after the checkpoint barriers are injected into the sources. This PR extends the duration of this blocking period so that an event for a subtask is blocked until the subtask completes the current checkpoint. By doing this, this PR preserves the consistency of these operator events during checkpoints and failovers.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a component of FLINK-26029, which aims to generalize the checkpoint protocol of operator coordinators and makes coordinators applicable for non-source operators as well.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- The subtask gateway can be closed/reopened and replaces the operator event valve.\r\n- An operator event type is introduced to notify the coordinator about a subtask completing a checkpoint.\r\n- Subtasks would send the operator event above to their coordinators after snapshotting their states.\r\n- The holder of an operator coordinator reopens a subtask gateway after it receives the operator event above, instead of after checkpoint barriers are injected into sources.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Added unit tests to verify the correctness of the closing/reopening behavior of subtask gateways.\r\n- Added integration tests to verify that the operator events sent from coordinators to subtask would not be lost after failover, even if the events are sent during checkpoints.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes)\r\n    - This PR additionally blocks the communication between a coordinator and its subtasks from when checkpoint barriers are sent to sources to when subtasks complete the checkpoint. This means that an operator event generated during checkpoints would be delivered only after the target subtask completes the checkpoint, bringing longer latency to that event.\r\n\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes)\r\n    - This PR affects the latency of operator events from coordinators to subtasks, as described above.\r\n\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)","created_at":"2022-07-14T12:03:18Z","updated_at":"2022-08-09T12:32:14Z","closed_at":"2022-08-09T12:32:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa7e56133be0bb7893471faf5f325e32ebf6507e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20275/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20275/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20275/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cbe9b913215e2faf19d3bad164d1ae6f9f9cc52f","head":{"label":"yunfengzhou-hub:FLINK-26029","ref":"FLINK-26029","sha":"cbe9b913215e2faf19d3bad164d1ae6f9f9cc52f","user":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":360814046,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjA4MTQwNDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"yunfengzhou-hub/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yunfengzhou-hub","id":54601269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NjAxMjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54601269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub","html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yunfengzhou-hub/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yunfengzhou-hub/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo refine the java doc for the annotation `VisibleForTesting`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  -  Change `This annotations` to `This annotation`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? N/A\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-14T09:23:15Z","updated_at":"2022-11-11T15:42:53Z","closed_at":"2022-11-11T15:42:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d46808928fde270a10d5b9f5ee0a66c725eef38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20273/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20273/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20273/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/63685a365478af0b17a0efca721347214ca6087e","head":{"label":"luoyuxia:hot-fix-refine-java-doc","ref":"hot-fix-refine-java-doc","sha":"63685a365478af0b17a0efca721347214ca6087e","user":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344411200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ0MTEyMDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"luoyuxia/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"luoyuxia","id":20389154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMzg5MTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20389154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia","html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/luoyuxia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/luoyuxia/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n Fix typos or mistakes of Flink CEP Document in the official website\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nFix the wrong version and wrong example result.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-14T08:25:15Z","updated_at":"2022-08-01T13:52:15Z","closed_at":"2022-08-01T13:52:15Z","merged_at":"2022-08-01T13:52:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"c3e72be836e1d14871109ceb0ddb2e98392f4ff1","assignee":{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"MartijnVisser","id":2989614,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODk2MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2989614?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser","html_url":"https://github.com/MartijnVisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MartijnVisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273329428,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzI5NDI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Library/CEP","name":"component=Library/CEP","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a4be4c84d71f9ea8ff8ae6b8e76a67c39c8efbff","head":{"label":"bgeng777:FLINK-28495","ref":"FLINK-28495","sha":"a4be4c84d71f9ea8ff8ae6b8e76a67c39c8efbff","user":{"login":"bgeng777","id":80749729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQ5NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80749729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777","html_url":"https://github.com/bgeng777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":397297946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTcyOTc5NDY=","name":"flink","full_name":"bgeng777/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bgeng777","id":80749729,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNzQ5NzI5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/80749729?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777","html_url":"https://github.com/bgeng777","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgeng777/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.githu

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a subtask referenced to [FLIP-241](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-241%3A+Completed+Jobs+Information+Enhancement), and Jira issue FLINK-28316.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Job status information is rearranged into a better structure, with an additional \"actions\" section which contains a navigation button to the job manager log. \r\n- Job vertex's subtask and taskManager in the History Server now support navigating to external TM log. The action button is disabled when the http request is loading or failed.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:  no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request makes the state serializer in `StateMap` could be updated when the `RegisteredKeyValueStateBackendMetaInfo` in `StateTable` has been changed.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Also update state serializer in `CopyOnWriteStateTable#setMetaInfo`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n - Added `CopyOnWriteStateTableTest#testSerializerAfterMetaInfoChanged`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-14T03:52:17Z","updated_at":"2022-07-26T15:42:54Z","closed_at":"2022-07-26T15:42:54Z","merged_at":"2022-07-26T15:42:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"8df50536ef913b63620d896423c39cdd01941c55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20268/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20268/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20268/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a3acad9f8798f51cd9bb95c3dbdb581094fac3dd","head":{"label":"masteryhx:FLINK-26853","ref":"FLINK-26853","sha":"a3acad9f8798f51cd9bb95c3dbdb581094fac3dd","user":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":436096625,"node_id":"R_kgDOGf5OcQ","name":"flink","full_name":"masteryhx/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"masteryhx","id":38719192,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzE5MTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38719192?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx","html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masteryhx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/masteryhx/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe FileSystemBehaviorTestSuite in flink-core has an implementation in most modules in flink-filesystems.  All of these implementations (one for each filesystem) should be migrated together.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis change is a code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\nFor the tests that can be locally, I verified that no tests were deleted.  Some of the tests have changed their names. \r\n\r\nEspecially note the technique of the inner class in `AzureFileSystemBehaviorITCase`: The https scheme tests are always performed, but the static inner class should repeat the tests with http support only if the best effort check succeeds.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):  no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no","created_at":"2022-07-13T22:48:46Z","updated_at":"2022-11-14T14:02:44Z","closed_at":"2022-10-27T13:04:22Z","merged_at":"2022-10-27T13:04:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"da226b3f0a4ea2d80cdecdaa082de181cbb9dc77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278672464,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4NjcyNDY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=FileSystems","name":"component=FileSystems","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20267/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20267/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20267/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e8bd48dd97a92f22e960344f6a3e6e48b62da8a9","head":{"label":"RyanSkraba:rskraba/FLINK-28542-flink-fs-core-base","ref":"rskraba/FLINK-28542-flink-fs-core-base","sha":"e8bd48dd97a92f22e960344f6a3e6e48b62da8a9","user":{"login":"RyanSkraba","id":7744819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDQ4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7744819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanSkraba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":400189343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDAxODkzNDM=","name":"flink","full_name":"RyanSkraba/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"RyanSkraba","id":7744819,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3NDQ4MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7744819?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba","html_url":"https://github.com/RyanSkraba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/RyanSkraba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/RyanSkraba/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe goal of this PR is to address a memory leak where the Kafka Producer does not get cleaned up after kafka commit is successful. This PR is a backported fix for Flink version 1.15, the original PR can be found [here](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20205).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n[FLINK-28250][Connector/Kafka] Fix exactly-once Kafka Sink out of memory\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually verified the change by running a 1 node cluster with 1 JobManagers and 1 TaskManagers, running the following job for several hours without any memory issues:\r\n```\r\npublic class FlinkTest {\r\n    public void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\r\n        StreamExecutionEnvironment env = StreamExecutionEnvironment.getExecutionEnvironment();\r\n        KafkaSource<String> source = KafkaSource.<String>builder()\r\n            .setBootstrapServers(\"localhost:9092\")\r\n            .setTopics(\"input\")\r\n            .setGroupId(\"my-group\" + System.currentTimeMillis())\r\n            .setStartingOffsets(OffsetsInitializer.earliest())\r\n            .setValueOnlyDeserializer(new SimpleStringSchema())\r\n            .build();\r\n        DataStream<String> sourceStream = env.fromSource(\r\n            source,\r\n            WatermarkStrategy.forMonotonousTimestamps(), \"Kafka Source\");\r\n        KafkaRecordSerializationSchema<String> serializer = KafkaRecordSerializationSchema.builder()\r\n            .setValueSerializationSchema(new SimpleStringSchema())\r\n            .setTopic(\"output\")\r\n            .build();\r\n        Properties sinkProps = new Properties();\r\n        sinkProps.put(\"[transaction.timeout.ms](http://transaction.timeout.ms/)\", 180000);\r\n        KafkaSink<String> sink = KafkaSink.<String>builder()\r\n            .setBootstrapServers(\"localhost:9092\")\r\n            .setKafkaProducerConfig(sinkProps)\r\n            .setRecordSerializer(serializer)\r\n            .setDeliverGuarantee(DeliveryGuarantee.EXACTLY_ONCE)\r\n            .build();\r\n        sourceStream.sinkTo(sink);\r\n        env.enableCheckpointing(10000);\r\n        env.getCheckpointConfig().setCheckpointTimeout(60000);\r\n        env.getCheckpointConfig().setCheckpointingMode(CheckpointingMode.EXACTLY_ONCE);\r\n        env.getCheckpointConfig().setMinPauseBetweenCheckpoints(500L);\r\n        env.getCheckpointConfig().setTolerableCheckpointFailureNumber(1);\r\n        env.execute(\"tester\");\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nTook heap dumps using `jmap` tool and noticed the taskmanager memory was stable.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nA subtask for the [FLIP-241](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-241%3A+Completed+Jobs+Information+Enhancement), the referenced issue is FLINK-28315.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSplit the per-subtask metrics and aggregated metrics into tabs, and add a table of aggregated metrics.\r\n\r\nExtend the original subtasks table by adding extra columns:\r\n- \"Accumulated Time\"\r\n- \"Status Durations\" \r\n\r\nUnder the TaskManagers tab, each taskManager row supports an action of viewing the \"Aggregated Metrics\". The modal's content table is identical to that under the subtask tab.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-13T02:36:27Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T04:11:48Z","closed_at":"2022-07-14T04:11:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c56bc2936c3798cde3dbb584f3b4e564ab080a0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272993074,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTkzMDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=%3Cnone%3E","name":"component=<none>","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20260/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20260/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20260/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f7a5810de360008c4f1f44122625e2222a914d53","head":{"label":"yangjunhan:feat/aggregation","ref":"feat/aggregation","sha":"f7a5810de360008c4f1f44122625e2222a914d53","user":{"login":"yangjunhan","id":50307523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzA3NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50307523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan","html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":304250838,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQyNTA4Mzg=","name":"flink","full_name":"yangjunhan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yangjunhan","id":50307523,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzA3NTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50307523?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan","html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangjunhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yangjunhan/flink","description":"Apache

Chinese translation\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-12T15:31:34Z","updated_at":"2022-07-14T03:07:34Z","closed_at":"2022-07-14T03:07:33Z","merged_at":"2022-07-14T03:07:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"2124280084243c5d46056dd6aa264f98beeaee4a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20255/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20255/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20255/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5ff1a54cfd958034bd92a01778ebea62010856c6","head":{"label":"dinggege1024:master","ref":"master","sha":"5ff1a54cfd958034bd92a01778ebea62010856c6","user":{"login":"dinggege1024","id":109070189,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoBHbQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109070189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024","html_url":"https://github.com/dinggege1024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":513194760,"node_id":"R_kgDOHpa7CA","name":"flink","full_name":"dinggege1024/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dinggege1024","id":109070189,"node_id":"U_kgDOBoBHbQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109070189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024","html_url":"https://github.com/dinggege1024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dinggege1024/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dinggege1024/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nTo make Hive dialect support `create function using jar`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  -  Get the function resource list to set them to `CatalogFunction` in parse phase\r\n  -  When create function for HiveCatalog , set the function's resources so that we can persist the resources info to HMS.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThe [test](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20251/files#diff-b9f5b4d8498dfe849cb01747b77c3b7c081e5262f850e845e88f807e6c3e9b11R293) to make sure HiveCatalog can persist function to HMS normally.\r\nThe [test](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/20251/files#diff-748a9fa63f15b3bd3ea5426a5b42179cadee77ecf3359c83f846aedb27d96871R723) is to make sure Hive dialect can using \"create [temporary] function using jar\".\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`:  no\r\n  - The serializers:  no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):  no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request fix the problem that files in local recovery directory hasn't be clean up properly after checkpoint abort.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Judge the checkpoint whether to register into TaskLocalStateStoreImpl when TaskLocalStateStoreImpl abortCheckpoint\r\n- try to delete the localRecovery directory even if the checkpoint isn't registered into TaskLocalStateStoreImpl\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\norg.apache.flink.runtime.state.TaskLocalStateStoreImplTest#abortUnregisteredCheckpoint()\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: yes\r\n  - The S3 file system

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pr aims to support getting statistics from catalog for partitioned table even without partition pruning in `FlinkRecomputeStatisticsProgram`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Adding get partition table stats from related catalog in  `FlinkRecomputeStatisticsProgram` while no partition prune happened.\r\n- Adding related tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nChange the result in `FileSystemStatisticsReportTest` and complete the TODO in `testNoPartitionPushDownAndCatalogStatisticsExist`.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAt first, this PR only wanted to support syntax `DESCRIBE EXTENDED` to print table statistics.

for AsyncSinkWriter\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis pull request makes the RateLimitingStrategy used in AsyncSinkWriter configurable by the sink implementer. That way a sink implementer can decide to implement a custom RateLimitingStrategy.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n- Introduced RateLimitingStrategy interface\r\n- Implemented a CongestionControlRateLimitingStrategy\r\n- Migrated tracking of inFlightMessages from AsyncSinkWriter into the RateLimitingStrategy\r\n- Introduced logic within AsyncSinkWriter to check with RateLimitingStrategy if the next request should be blocked.\r\n- Introduced a new AsyncSinkWriter constructor and deprecated the old AsyncSinkWriter constructors.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Added test that verifies AsyncSinkWriter respects the RateLimitingStrategy passed into the constructor\r\n- Added test that verifies AIMDRateLimitingStrategy follows a linear increase and multiplicative decrease\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluster with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce the REST endpoint framework based on Endpoint API.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce the RestEndpointFactory based on FactoryUtils*\r\n  - *Introduce the Rest Endpoint*\r\n  - *Introduce some test utils for Rest API*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests to verify the rest endpoint works well with mocked handlers.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no )\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-10T10:30:41Z","updated_at":"2022-08-02T05:50:15Z","closed_at":"2022-08-02T05:50:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e77ccdcef556cad361ed01e48aa709a0c33e17e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/20236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/20236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/10de5ff5308a8983b3d57ea04aa4831fb6f9fc50","head":{"label":"WencongLiu:dev_endpoint_framework","ref":"dev_endpoint_framework","sha":"10de5ff5308a8983b3d57ea04aa4831fb6f9fc50","user":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":486167626,"node_id":"R_kgDOHPpUSg","name":"flink","full_name":"WencongLiu/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WencongLiu","id":104502720,"node_id":"U_kgDOBjqVwA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104502720?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu","html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WencongLiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WencongLiu/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nHelp user locate the container where a task is running on from Web UI by including port in the host info on Web UI.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Include port as part of the host info in `SubtaskExecutionAttemptDetailsInfo`.\r\n2. Introduce a new method `toLocationString` in `TaskManagerLocation` to align the behavior of pretty printing taskmanager location in REST handlers.\r\n3. Rename column name from \"Host\" to \"Host:port\" on Web UI to reflect the change of adding port info.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `SubtaskCurrentAttemptDetailsHandlerTest.testHandleRequest()`.\r\n\r\nAlso manually verified the change by running a cluster.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/22020529/08767324-b8d9-4800-8133-538385fe284d)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/flink/assets/22020529/08a1106c-c96c-4035-8372-f9cbda02fab2)\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no) no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no) no\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know) no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no) yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request marks the configuration option \"pipeline.time-characteristic\" as deprecated and set its default value to EVENT_TIME to reflect the changes made by FLIP-134 in Flink 1.12, so that users won't get confused.\r\n\r\nQuoting from Flink 1.12's release note:\r\n\r\n> In Flink 1.12 the default stream time characteristic has been changed to `EventTime`, thus you don't need to call this method for enabling event-time support anymore. Explicitly using processing-time windows and timers works in event-time mode. If you need to disable watermarks, please use `ExecutionConfig.setAutoWatermarkInterval(long)`. If you are using `IngestionTime`, please manually set an appropriate `WatermarkStrategy`. If you are using generic \"time window\" operations (for example `KeyedStream.timeWindow()` that change behaviour based on the time characteristic, please use equivalent operations that explicitly specify processing time or event time.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Mark `StreamPipelineOptions#TIME_CHARACTERISTIC` as deprecated and change its default value to `TimeCharacteristic.EventTime` to be consistent with the underneath default time characteristic change introduced in Flink 1.12.\r\n- The doc is removed as the doc generator will skip deprecated options.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate the `flink-formats/flink-parquet` module to AssertJ and JUnit 5 following the [JUnit 5 Migration Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1514Wa_aNB9bJUen4xm5uiuXOooOJTtXqS_Jqk9KJitU/edit)\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Removed dependences on JUnit 4, JUnit 5 Assertions and Hamcrest where possible.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\nI've verified that there are 94 tests run in this module before and after the refactoring.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive):no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nLet `CheckedThread` supports pass a `RunnableWithException` to constructor, this will make it behave more like a thread.\r\nAfter this pr, we can use `CheckedThread` as the same way of using `Thread` like: `new Thread(Runnable runnable)` or\r\n`new Thread()` and then override `Thread.run()` method. Just change it to `CheckedThread(RunnableWithException runnableWithException)` or `new CheckedThread()` and then override `CheckedThread.go()` method.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Let `CheckedThread` supports pass a `RunnableWithException` to constructor*\r\n  - *All anonymous inner class based on it are replaced by lambda expressions constructor*\r\n  - *Add test for CheckedThread*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified by `CheckedThreadTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following
