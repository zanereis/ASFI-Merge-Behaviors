we set the default JS engine dynamically, so that newly spawned processes would use the new setting. However, we didn't actively try to kill the old JS processes. Since a quiet cluster, without much concurrent indexing activity, could hang on to the same set of spawned processes for a while, it may take an indeterminate amount of time until the couchjs processes actually switch to the new engine.\r\n\r\nTo fix that let's force a `reload()` as well, which will immediately kill all the free (available) processes and then kill the acquired processes when the user is done with them and releases them back to the process manager.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-31T16:59:51Z","updated_at":"2025-01-31T17:48:16Z","closed_at":"2025-01-31T17:48:15Z","merged_at":"2025-01-31T17:48:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"d459256bb2dc51138ab6d4f4c3d341394dc7e221","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5419/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5419/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5419/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/6b7f2361a04cae25dc452524558374f202e8e716","head":{"label":"apache:call-reload-after-js-engine-switch-over","ref":"call-reload-after-js-engine-switch-over","sha":"6b7f2361a04cae25dc452524558374f202e8e716","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

to landing SpiderMonkey 102+ we relied on a global `seal()` function that we defined in our custom `couchjs` C/C++ code.\r\n\r\nSM 102+ no longer exposes the API needed to implement this, but the JS standard also includes a userspace `Object.freeze()` method we can use.\r\n\r\nOur initial implementation of SM 102+ support introduced[1] a global `deepFreeze()` function that relied on `Reflect .ownKeys()` which is not available in SpiderMonkey 1.8.5, but all later ones we support.\r\n\r\nTo fix the build for SM 1.8.5, we partly reverted[2] the use of `deepFreeze()`, but we missed a few spots in `main.js` where we seal our own new globals like `Couch`[3].\r\n\r\nThis commit reinstates the use of `deepFreeze()` everywhere and adds a safe fallback inside `deepFreeze()` to do the right thing for SM 1.8.5 and > 1.8.5.\r\n\r\nTested on macOS with SM 128:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> ./src/couch/priv/couchjs -V\r\ncouchjs - Apache CouchDB 3.4.2-70fc2cc-dirty (SpiderMonkey 128.6.0)\r\n[...]\r\n\r\n>

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\nWhen running with old version of Clouseau, it will return `{ok, null}`\r\nwhen we call `clouseau_rpc:version().`.

parallel preads\r\n\r\nLet clients issue concurrent pread calls without blocking each other or having to wait for all the writes and fsync calls.\r\n\r\nEven though at the POSIX level pread calls are thread-safe [1], Erlang OTP file backend forces a single controlling process for raw file handles. So, all our reads were always funneled through the couch_file gen_server, having to queue up behind potentially slower writes. In particular this is problematic with remote file systems, where fsyncs and writes may take a lot longer while preads can hit the cache and return quicker.\r\n\r\nParallel pread calls are implemented via a NIF which copies some of the file functions OTP's prim_file NIF [2]. The original OTP handle is dup-ed, and then closed, then our NIF takes control of the new duplicated file descriptor. This is necessary in order to allow multiple reader access via reader/writer locks, and also to carefully manage the closing state.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep things simple the new handles created by `couch_cfile` implements the `#file_descriptor{module = $Module, data = $Data}` protocol, such that once opened the regular `file` module in OTP will know how to dispatch calls with this handle to our `couch_cfile.erl` functions. In this way most of the couch_file stays the same, with all the same `file:` calls in the main data path.\r\n\r\ncouch_cfile bypass is also opportunistic, if it is not available (on Windows) or not enabled, things proceed as before.\r\n\r\nThe reason we need a new dup()-ed file descriptor is to manage closing very carefully. Since on POSIX systems file descriptors are just integers, it's very easy to accidentally read from an already closed and re-opened (by something\r\nelse) file descriptor. That's why there are locks and a whole new file descriptor which our NIF controls. But as long as we control the the file descriptor with our resource \"handle\" we can be sure it will stay open and won't be re-used by any other process.\r\n\r\nSince neither one of the three compatible IOQ systems currently know how call a simple MFA, and instead only send a `$gen_call` message to a gen_server, parallel cfile reads are only available if we bypass the IOQ. By default if the requests are already configured to bypass the IOQ, then they will use the parallel preads. To enable parallel preads for all requests, toggle the `[couchdb] cfile_skip_ioq` setting to `true`.\r\n\r\nTo gain confidence that the new `couch_cfile` behaves the same way as the Erlang/OTP one there is a property test which asserts that for any pair of `{Raw, CFile}` handle any supported file operations return exactly the same results. It was validated by modifying some of couch_file.c arguments and the property tests started to fail.\r\n\r\nA simple sequential benchmark was run initially to show that even the most unfavorable case, all sequential operations, we haven't gotten worse:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> fabric_bench:go(#{q=>1, n=>1, doc_size=>small, docs=>100000}).\r\n *** Parameters\r\n * batch_size       : 1000\r\n * doc_size         : small\r\n * docs             : 100000\r\n * individual_docs  : 1000\r\n * n                : 1\r\n * q                : 1\r\n\r\n *** Environment\r\n * Nodes        : 1\r\n * Bench ver.   : 1\r\n * N            : 1\r\n * Q            : 1\r\n * OS           : unix/linux\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach case ran 5 times and picked the best rate in ops/sec, so higher is better:\r\n\r\n```\r\n

can use fdatasync to save 1 extra write per call, for a total of 2 writes per commit, since we do two syncs, one for data block up to the header, then another after the header.\r\n\r\nAs of OTP 25 (our oldest supported version) we use:\r\n  * On Linux/BSDs: fdatasync()\r\n  * On Window: FlushFileBuffers() i.e. the same as for file:sync/1\r\n  * On MacOS: fcntl(fd,F_FULLFSYNC/F_BARRIERFSYNC)\r\n\r\nAccording to https://linux.die.net/man/2/fdatasync\r\n\r\n > fdatasync() is similar to fsync(), but does not flush modified metadata\r\n unless that metadata is needed in order to allow a subsequent data retrieval\r\n to be correctly handled. For example, changes to st_atime or\r\n st_mtime (respectively, time of last access and time of last modification; see\r\n stat(2)) do not require flushing because they are not necessary for a\r\n subsequent data read to be handled correctly. On the other hand, a change to\r\n the file size (st_size, as made by say ftruncate(2)), would require a metadata\r\n flush.\r\n\r\nThe key things for us are:\r\n\r\n  * It updates the size (positions) correctly\r\n  * We do not rely or care about atime/mtime for safety or correctness\r\n  * Erlang VM does the right thing on all the supported OSes\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-13T21:07:00Z","updated_at":"2025-01-13T22:23:07Z","closed_at":"2025-01-13T22:09:30Z","merged_at":"2025-01-13T22:09:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"5ed0654abd69748d769043ed677ca46c655db84c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5398/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5398/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5398/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/37e8b32039c813de2241eb7be3c81b405c9c2120","head":{"label":"apache:use-fdatasync","ref":"use-fdatasync","sha":"37e8b32039c813de2241eb7be3c81b405c9c2120","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

`pread_iolist/2`, `IS_OLD_STATE`, `close` cast handler and 0110 upgrade code.\r\n\r\nMake `pread_binary/2` return a proper `{error, Error}` term instead of letting it crash with a `badmatch`. It was already documented to return an error tuple.\r\n\r\nImplement `pread_binary` and `pread_term` as instances of `pread_binaries` and `pread_terms`. This reduces code size quite a bit, as the gen_server now only has to handle `{pread_iolists, ...}` and `{append_binaries, ...}` as the main data path calls. Internally, Erlang/OTP VM may still fallback to non-vectorized pread and pwrite versions, but that's handled transparently. Besides, we never really handled it as a fallback anyway, it was just plain code duplication.\r\n\r\nFix bug in `{pread_iolists, ...}` call handler, where it incorrectly matched `IoList` in the `{Checksum, IoList} = extract_checksum(IoList)` line. We never had tests for this function, so also add tests for it.\r\n\r\n`read_beyond_eof` and `exceed_pread_limit` incorrectly used throw functionality from a gen_server. Gen servers handle throws as early returns, however the terms we threw were not proper replies, to servers crashed with an unrelated `bad_return` error previously. Maintain the top level behavior of crashing the gen_server on those error, but provide neater error both to the caller and as the gen_server crash reason. Update tests to assert that this happens.\r\n\r\nOptimize `verify_checksum/5`. Since we removed `pread_iolist/2` this function can deal with just binaries, and we never have to turn our iolists into binaries just to run `verify_checksum/5` so we avoid wasting another call to `iolist_to_binary/1` and then throwing the result away.\r\n\r\nIncrease test coverage from 66% to

Overview\r\n\r\nCouchDB issues all write requests in parallel without coordination, applying a quorum on the results of those independent actions. When updating a document concurrently this can lead to the introduction of a stored conflict if two different writes reach separate nodes first. This is undesirable.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes fabric_doc_update in the following ways;\r\n\r\n1. Workers are no longer started immediately, but are given a unique reference each.\r\n2. For each range in the write request, one node is chosen to \"lead\" the write decision (calculated as the lowest live node that hosts the shard range)\r\n3. \"Leader\" workers are started.\r\n4. Any doc update that receives \"conflict\" from a Leader is added to the reply dict W times and the doc updates are removed from the other (unstarted) workers. If that leaves the worker with nothing to do, it is removed entirely.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThere is some existing coverage in the module itself but more testing is needed before this can be merged.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] Documentation changes were made in the `src/docs` folder\r\n- [ ] Documentation changes were backported (separated PR) to affected

we included attachment sizes in the active size totals even if the attachments were deleted from the doc revision leafs.\r\n\r\nThe fix is, unsurprisingly, to do what the compactor does when it copies and updates sizes: only update sizes for leaf revision during the rev-tree traversal. We did this for doc bodies already in #4264, but forgot to consider attachments then.\r\n\r\nIn general we're aiming for the active size to approximate the size of the file after compaction. That is what drives smoosh (autocompaction) priority. If we don't remove non-leaf attachments from the calculation, the active/file ratio in smoosh may never trigger properly as ratio will stay low for shards with large attachments.\r\n\r\nUntil a release goes out with this fix, a workaround could be to compact shards with large attachments by hand, or use a lower threshold on `slack_dbs` channel (and concurrency=1 to keep it in the background) to slowly cycle through all the shards and try to compact them.\r\n\r\nWhile the fix itself is small, to convince ourselves we did the right thing update the tests to check a few corner cases.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough we had a disabled Elixir compaction test which we disabled because it was \"mysteriously\" not reporting a lower \"active\" size after compacting. So re-enable it and also improve it a bit to have both a attachment that gets deleted and one that stays live.\r\n\r\nFix

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

This is because each test in the same class used the same database name, and in the setUp function always delete and recreate it, which caused a race condition. Using custom database names should solve it.\r\n\r\n- Makefile: Add `-F, --failfast` to stop mango tests early on failures\r\n- Add `setUp()` and `teardown()` to create/delete db for each test to  \r\n  avoid `org.apache.lucene.store.NoSuchDirectory Exception` errors.\r\n- Replace `self.db.recreate()` with `super().setUp(db_per_test=True)`\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make mango-test`\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it

when mem3 failed such that it's shards ets table disappeared, while the replicator was processing doc updates, it was possible for the `couch_replicator_utils:owner/2` to raise `error:badarg` (passed through from the ets:* calls) to be registered as a malformed (failed) replicator doc update. After that, the replication job would be effectively stuck in the `failed` state until the user took action to re-create it.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, change the doc update callback to on only fail jobs on explicit replication doc parse failures (they have `throw({the bad_rep_doc, _}) exception pattern). In any other case let the exception crash the db changes feed and let the supervisor restart it.\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-07T05:26:00Z","updated_at":"2024-11-07T16:32:05Z","closed_at":"2024-11-07T16:32:02Z","merged_at":"2024-11-07T16:32:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"316c8bd07b12110ddff3153d72e3cf95368e548f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5337/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5337/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5337/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/41ce10f94dab20bcba2af04881b02ac59c60ed9b","head":{"label":"apache:prevent-broken-mem3-from-failing-replication-jobs","ref":"prevent-broken-mem3-from-failing-replication-jobs","sha":"41ce10f94dab20bcba2af04881b02ac59c60ed9b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

if users had invalid ddocs in the cluster, for instance something like `_design/`, the scanner would crash when transforming them into `#doc{}` records. That happened because the `couch_doc` function would automatically revalidate them: check max doc length ID, attachments format, revision format, doc ID format, etc. Which is altogether silly, since they are already saved in our cluster.\r\n\r\nSo, to avoid wasting resources revalidating existing documents, and crashing the scanner process, use a much simpler function to transform the ddocs: make a new `#doc{}` record with the ID and body by throwing away all the \"special\" doc fields we don't care about (`_rev`, `_conflicts`, ...).\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-01T21:51:55Z","updated_at":"2024-11-01T22:47:37Z","closed_at":"2024-11-01T22:47:35Z","merged_at":"2024-11-01T22:47:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"f0a004643a9577efb64e8a4c25d4e1cd7cd1ed90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/5331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/5331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/1afa1d3481a9c14fbab4e3f5c2f1a42f15dcddc9","head":{"label":"apache:skip-validation-for-scanner-ddocs","ref":"skip-validation-for-scanner-ddocs","sha":"1afa1d3481a9c14fbab4e3f5c2f1a42f15dcddc9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

the previous PR [1] Jessica had discovered that an invalid engine setting crashes the server. Initially I had thought we would be strict about it and just let it crash, but that seems a bit harsh for this. Especially if there is a large cluster and configuration is pushed to all nodes. It would crash the whole cluster.\r\n\r\nInstead, since we have a default, stick with that.

PR combines work from #4305 (@nickva) #5146 (@big-r81) & and #5306 (@indutny) plus some more original work from @indutny to swap out our usage of our [homegrown `seal()`](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/main/src/couch/priv/couch_js/86/main.cpp#L214-L228) function for [`Object.freeze()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze#deep_freezing).\r\n\r\nCompiles and `make check` passes on macOS with SpiderMonkey 91, 102, 115 and 128.\r\n\r\nIt’d be great if we can test this on other systems as well and double check that `Object.freeze()` has the security properties be want (but I think it does, it might even be stricter than before, not allowing reassignment of values to existing properties).\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue is that starting with SpiderMonkey 102 one of our original `seal()` calls would seal the [`State.funs` array](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/main/share/server/state.js#L16), which then makes a subsequent [`State.funs.push()`](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/main/share/server/state.js#L32) fail with the type error reported in #4305 and #5146. (h/t to @indutny for teasing this out).\r\n\r\nThis [should unblock support for Ubuntu 24.04](https://github.com/apache/couchdb-pkg/issues/136), which ships with SpiderMonkey 128.\r\n\r\nIt feels like the build args lists in `src/couch/rebar.config.script` are due for a refactor, but I didn’t want to mess too much with the shape of the project just yet.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the differences in `couch_js/main.cpp` and `couch_js/util.cpp` from 91 to 128 are not a lot and one could argue we should start switching to `ifdef` the relevant bits, rather than duplicating a lot of code. On the other hand, this will make it easier to drop versions later, if we ever want to.\r\n\r\nThanks all for doing the hard work here, I’m just pulling it all together to validate this is (hopefully) a way forward ✌️
