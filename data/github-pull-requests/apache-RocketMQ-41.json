What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1) The goal of this PR is to dynamically calculate proper JVM heap available for RocketMQ namesrv and broker, and set them in JVM options when they get started. It is derived from the community project apache/rocketmq-externals [PR #89](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-externals/pull/89), which aims to run Rocketmq in Docker daemon environments. \r\n\r\n2) Due to the default JVM heap demands of the RocketMQ namesrv and broker, user in community raised issue like  [Issue #78](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-externals/issues/78). This PR also aims to solve this kind of issue from upstream.\r\n\r\n`Please note that this change only works for Linux/MacOS servers.`\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we use gawk to calculate the max possible heap used by a JVM, and set JVM options for namesrv and broker.

So it should be compatible with any VM or bare-metal environments based on CentOS 7. Details can be found in apache/rocketmq-externals [PR #89](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-externals/pull/89).\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

id\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPerformance improvement.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n `ConsumeMessageConcurrentlyService#consumeMessageDirectly` and `ConsumeMessageOrderlyService#consumeMessageDirectly`, the `ArrayList` just add one element, so set 1 to initialCapacity can avoid `ArrayList#grow`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).","created_at":"2018-08-03T13:13:55Z","updated_at":"2018-08-06T09:44:37Z","closed_at":"2018-08-06T08:17:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4b162b573fa12e019290c82d04515d3276f1c82","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/7df26a4745a4b59651ff153b3fac2750d8b7e67f","head":{"label":"ShiyuChai:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"7df26a4745a4b59651ff153b3fac2750d8b7e67f","user":{"login":"ShiyuChai","id":15905616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTA1NjE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15905616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai","html_url":"https://github.com/ShiyuChai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ShiyuChai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"7cae583918be94f3a7a530feef6bd6fac4292e2d","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFIX the issue described in  #379 .\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nSince the timestamp argument provided to the consumer(*beginTimestamp* or *endTimestamp*\r\n) which is later than now is not valid, we should verify them before we actually pull a message from the broker.\r\nAnd the following are corresponding changes:\r\n- Add verification of command line argument *beginTimestamp* and *endTimestamp*\r\n- exit the program if any of the arguments are invalid\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think we should print report messages in the same style, so I change the messages to capitalized.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exists. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-23T11:54:31Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T15:10:34Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T15:09:27Z","merged_at":"2018-07-23T15:09:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"ba91ec8a7ed83cb312cd0d5251e6ddc2373e117f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/380/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/380/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/380/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/e17cbba1655f34619793fefdd410e8dc9dd6d89d","head":{"label":"xiaozongyang:fix-consume-from-invalid-time","ref":"fix-consume-from-invalid-time","sha":"e17cbba1655f34619793fefdd410e8dc9dd6d89d","user":{"login":"xiaozongyang","id":8848479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDg0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8848479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaozongyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141223448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDEyMjM0NDg=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"xiaozongyang/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaozongyang","id":8848479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDg0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8848479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaozongyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaozongyang/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

easily.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-23T05:33:09Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T15:12:06Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T11:50:51Z","merged_at":"2018-07-23T11:50:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f7dda3c0c5fb7de74ece7b9ce690a978c58a319","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/10e597f66cfde4721600565c103e4ce8c197ee1d","head":{"label":"xiaozongyang:fix-consumeMessage-not-quit-when-catch-message","ref":"fix-consumeMessage-not-quit-when-catch-message","sha":"10e597f66cfde4721600565c103e4ce8c197ee1d","user":{"login":"xiaozongyang","id":8848479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDg0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8848479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaozongyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":141223448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDEyMjM0NDg=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"xiaozongyang/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaozongyang","id":8848479,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDg0Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8848479?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaozongyang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaozongyang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaozongyang/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

easily.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-19T15:09:40Z","updated_at":"2018-07-23T15:12:25Z","closed_at":"2018-07-23T11:58:10Z","merged_at":"2018-07-23T11:58:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"439796f7c4c916734a334b95b1c17de63ffe1620","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/376/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/376/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/376/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/8ce288de860e6d5284bd0ddfc3935e987ef650a6","head":{"label":"huangyiminghappy:develop_remove_telNumber","ref":"develop_remove_telNumber","sha":"8ce288de860e6d5284bd0ddfc3935e987ef650a6","user":{"login":"huangyiminghappy","id":9736914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzY5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9736914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy","html_url":"https://github.com/huangyiminghappy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86918183,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjkxODE4Mw==","name":"incubator-rocketmq","full_name":"huangyiminghappy/incubator-rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huangyiminghappy","id":9736914,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MzY5MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9736914?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy","html_url":"https://github.com/huangyiminghappy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huangyiminghappy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huangyiminghappy/incubator-rocketmq","description":"Mirror

do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first. \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen sending a transaction check request, ProducerManager returned available connection is not the current connection, but the next connection.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-16T14:22:52Z","updated_at":"2018-07-31T03:12:29Z","closed_at":"2018-07-17T07:49:18Z","merged_at":"2018-07-17T07:49:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"ed433a3c930b2106a65d45c5bf292c3b52fdc266","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543180,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/5fc2032fbcb893300adc2ac29e275ecf4a3aabc2","head":{"label":"duhengforever:develop_fix","ref":"develop_fix","sha":"5fc2032fbcb893300adc2ac29e275ecf4a3aabc2","user":{"login":"duhengforever","id":39583243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39583243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever","html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139727330,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk3MjczMzA=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"duhengforever/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"duhengforever","id":39583243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39583243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever","html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-14T05:57:31Z","updated_at":"2018-07-16T13:48:52Z","closed_at":"2018-07-14T06:07:20Z","merged_at":"2018-07-14T06:07:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ccd6f97e5b3d1d2c46de566486f8a82c46e20de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/365/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/365/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/365/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/1143478510cbbb2dfec80c6ffb1c7ba244d2dbbc","head":{"label":"duhengforever:develop_fix","ref":"develop_fix","sha":"1143478510cbbb2dfec80c6ffb1c7ba244d2dbbc","user":{"login":"duhengforever","id":39583243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39583243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever","html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139727330,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzk3MjczMzA=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"duhengforever/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"duhengforever","id":39583243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NTgzMjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39583243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever","html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/duhengforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/duhengforever/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first. \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn order to implement  eventual consistency in distributed system, we define a new type of message named transactional message, it can be thought of as a two-phase commit message implementation to ensure eventual consistency in distributed system. Transactional message ensures that the execution of local transaction and the sending of message can be performed atomically.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nIn our implementation, we made full use of the mechanism of rocketMQ itself to avoid external dependencies, and we defined a pair of message: named half message and commit/rollback message.  Half message means prepared message, which are not visible to consumers，and it will be sent before local transaction is executed. After the local transaction ends，producer will send a commit or rollback message to broker based on local transaction execution result\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first. \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nIn order to implement  eventual consistency in distributed system, we define a new type of message named transactional message, it can be thought of as a two-phase commit message implementation to ensure eventual consistency in distributed system. Transactional message ensures that the execution of local transaction and the sending of message can be performed atomically.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nIn our implementation, we made full use of the mechanism of rocketMQ itself to avoid external dependencies, and we defined a pair of message: named half message and commit/rollback message.  Half message means prepared message, which are not visible to consumers，and it will be sent before local transaction is executed. After the local transaction ends，producer will send a commit or rollback message to broker based on local transaction execution result\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it).

Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).","created_at":"2018-07-04T11:36:17Z","updated_at":"2018-07-13T03:32:14Z","closed_at":"2018-07-13T03:32:14Z","merged_at":"2018-07-13T03:32:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"840e04c7e148674a270481a57304c126e73c1674","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/355/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/355/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/355/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/b5eb7b215b74a447353e5d7fbfd82beb6516c80a","head":{"label":"Hellojungle:fixRebalanceWhenAddConsumer","ref":"fixRebalanceWhenAddConsumer","sha":"b5eb7b215b74a447353e5d7fbfd82beb6516c80a","user":{"login":"Hellojungle","id":18479517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDc5NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18479517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle","html_url":"https://github.com/Hellojungle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":134733246,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzQ3MzMyNDY=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"Hellojungle/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Hellojungle","id":18479517,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDc5NTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18479517?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle","html_url":"https://github.com/Hellojungle","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Hellojungle/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Hellojungle/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-01T07:24:57Z","updated_at":"2018-07-01T07:28:42Z","closed_at":"2018-07-01T07:26:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a057cd7e3744f22ca38264951094574211cd1c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/3365f102fee36c382d4ee1a57d4f355d843d7f00","head":{"label":"LostKe:release-4.2.0","ref":"release-4.2.0","sha":"3365f102fee36c382d4ee1a57d4f355d843d7f00","user":{"login":"LostKe","id":12644728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjQ0NzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12644728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe","html_url":"https://github.com/LostKe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":139308482,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzkzMDg0ODI=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"LostKe/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LostKe","id":12644728,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjQ0NzI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12644728?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe","html_url":"https://github.com/LostKe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LostKe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LostKe/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

applying this patch.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

[x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

[x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first. \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nFix Concurrent issue of StoreStatsService\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nStoreStatsService#getSinglePutMessageTopicSizeTotal and StoreStatsService#getSinglePutMessageTopicTimesTotal are not thread safe which could return a different instance under high concurrent scenario ,normally this won't happen ,because the cost of creating a AtomicLong and put it into a map can be ignored ,but when that happens, Stats could be inaccuracy\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFix Concurrent issue of StoreStatsService\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first. \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix broker and nameserver startup of develop branch.More information see \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/256\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd slf4j dependency to broker and nameserver.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThere is no test case in this case.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

do not create a Pull Request without creating an issue first. \r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen consumeMessage failed, we need to confirm the accurate scope of influence which depend on the log rather than printmsg. So adding dlq message stat log for security audit which contains topic,consumerGroup and msgId is a good choice. https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues/254\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd dlq message log in consumeSendBack.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Make sure there is a Github issue filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIt is becoming commonplace to have more than one Network Interface Card (NIC), usually one for local network communication, another for remote communication.\r\nSupporting multiple Network Interface Cards support for “Broker Machine” could be very useful.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1 Broker will report multiple addresses to Name Server, the format is like the multiple nameServer addr: ip1;ip2;ip3:port\r\n\r\n2 After consumer/producer get the route info from Name Server, there is a test or detect process, then store one accessible address for each broker.\r\n\r\n3 All the changes are backward compatible. But if using the changed broker and old version client, the consumer/producer will get exception because fetched broker’s addr is not “ip:port”, it could be “ip1;ip2:port”.\r\n\r\n4 add a configure Parameter in the broker to disable the new feature\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x ] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix concurrent bug in MappedFileQueue#findMappedFileByOffset, which may cause message loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThe origin bug only occurs when the mappedFileQueue is deleting mappedFiles from the head of the queue. So the main idea of this bug fix is to check if the firstMappedFile in the queue is changed. If it changed, we may get the wrong mappedFile, and we handle this by doing retries. \r\n\r\nFinally, If it failed after 3 times, we will try to find the mappedFile by iterating through all the mappedFiles in the queue to ensure returning the right result (solution from zhouxinyu).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-12T09:05:54Z","updated_at":"2018-07-14T03:09:02Z","closed_at":"2018-07-14T03:09:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b7645f084fbb7b6efd55004da79b3d670a2abaad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/227/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/227/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/227/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/a0e5c810fe14304cc1a3ff3065e14c18d8adbfa8","head":{"label":"Jason918:ROCKETMQ-332","ref":"ROCKETMQ-332","sha":"a0e5c810fe14304cc1a3ff3065e14c18d8adbfa8","user":{"login":"Jason918","id":2770146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzAxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2770146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918","html_url":"https://github.com/Jason918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":107122577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDcxMjI1Nzc=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"Jason918/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jason918","id":2770146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NzAxNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2770146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918","html_url":"https://github.com/Jason918","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jason918/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jason918/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs logging is widely used in rocketmq such as in broker ,nameserver, client and slf4j is used as default logging module.

In my opinion, a logging module is needed in this case. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Add InternalLogger use rocketmq innser usage and default logging system is slf4j.\r\n2.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n1. We need to known post time stat since there is failure in consume. \r\n2. updateConsumeOffsetToBroker log in client is large as log level is info.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Add consume post time stat.\r\n2. delete updateConsumeOffsetToBroker info log\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI think there is no need to add testcases for this PR.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-25T12:24:59Z","updated_at":"2018-05-29T09:24:24Z","closed_at":"2018-05-29T09:24:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"968b81b1414c26000d4450671f2e63e354550529","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/0e09e265456f81315a3b2d1edd67fc0370638cb5","head":{"label":"lindzh:fix_asyncSend","ref":"fix_asyncSend","sha":"0e09e265456f81315a3b2d1edd67fc0370638cb5","user":{"login":"lindzh","id":5078928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzg5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5078928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh","html_url":"https://github.com/lindzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83410751,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQxMDc1MQ==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"lindzh/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lindzh","id":5078928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzg5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5078928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh","html_url":"https://github.com/lindzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lindzh/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAs logging isolation has been fix with logging component, it is necessary to replace slf4j api used in RocketMQ with InternalLogger now!\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Replace slf4j api used in RocketMQ.\r\n2. Fix ClientLogger with InnerLoggerFactory.\r\n3. Add NettyLogger adapter using InternalLogger for remoting.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nReview the source code and run the unit/it tests\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-23T13:26:28Z","updated_at":"2021-06-21T12:32:51Z","closed_at":"2018-03-07T06:29:10Z","merged_at":"2018-03-07T06:29:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"46f91479d95186e171b7ac43c9639972354e7ff2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/221/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/221/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/221/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/9218f41044ebec85d74ac84c1db42cad384fde0c","head":{"label":"lindzh:fix_client_log_full","ref":"fix_client_log_full","sha":"9218f41044ebec85d74ac84c1db42cad384fde0c","user":{"login":"lindzh","id":5078928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzg5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5078928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh","html_url":"https://github.com/lindzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83410751,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQxMDc1MQ==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"lindzh/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lindzh","id":5078928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzg5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5078928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh","html_url":"https://github.com/lindzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lindzh/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix concurrent bug in MappedFileQueue#findMappedFileByOffset, which may cause message loss\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `findmappedfilebyoffset` method may return the wrong mapped file or null if the delete behavior occurs concurrently.\r\n\r\nSo change the find process:\r\n\r\n1. Find the target mapped file by calculated index.\r\n2. Verify the target mapped file is right.\r\n3. Iterate the whole list and find the right mapped file.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, it's a O(1) method and will be degrade to O(n) if the concurrent issue occurs.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nReview the source code and run the unit/it tests\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-16T13:41:59Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T13:08:25Z","closed_at":"2018-02-27T07:42:23Z","merged_at":"2018-02-27T07:42:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"b391594b50699299c2657e98bdf5c752066d5429","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/220/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/220/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/220/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/9151a32b2e62c4263604a2e4c2593da03f022d24","head":{"label":"zhouxinyu:ROCKETMQ-332","ref":"ROCKETMQ-332","sha":"9151a32b2e62c4263604a2e4c2593da03f022d24","user":{"login":"zhouxinyu","id":3961183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjExODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3961183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouxinyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"d849e0ad989dc89e5e439d48700824d138d09ae9","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subsc

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMake the _expressionType_ has a definite value.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Add a default value to _expressionType_ of _SubscriptionData_.\r\n3. Empty check in _isTagType_ of _ExpressionType_.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/ROCKETMQ-351?filter=allopenissues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-05T09:08:21Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T13:10:02Z","closed_at":"2018-01-23T06:12:34Z","merged_at":"2018-01-23T06:12:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"a096580f3152e12fc9f9876c9e9721eb0109a90a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/214/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/214/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/214/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/5d4dac18d6f61f2bc2380c749707da7e294bfc7d","head":{"label":"vsair:ROCKETMQ-351","ref":"ROCKETMQ-351","sha":"5d4dac18d6f61f2bc2380c749707da7e294bfc7d","user":{"login":"vsair","id":2600589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDA1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2600589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair","html_url":"https://github.com/vsair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83013662,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzAxMzY2Mg==","name":"incubator-rocketmq","full_name":"vsair/incubator-rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vsair","id":2600589,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDA1ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2600589?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair","html_url":"https://github.com/vsair","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vsair/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vsair/incubator-rocketmq","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAfter using updateTopic command to change retry queue nums to more than 1 ,but consumer consume send back always choose 0. After change retry queue nums, it may randomly send to all queues.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nWhen consumer send back messages, send to retry topic queues randomly rather than send to only one using consumeSubConfig.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-28T07:08:44Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T08:03:17Z","closed_at":"2018-07-14T03:13:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a21d9510ba201868f9fd3bd2472a930c90cd9e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/213/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/213/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/213/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/7fef3baa056dedbb2c4784c2eeb65243d9716989","head":{"label":"lindzh:fix_retry_dlq_nums","ref":"fix_retry_dlq_nums","sha":"7fef3baa056dedbb2c4784c2eeb65243d9716989","user":{"login":"lindzh","id":5078928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzg5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5078928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh","html_url":"https://github.com/lindzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83410751,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQxMDc1MQ==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"lindzh/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lindzh","id":5078928,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzg5Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5078928?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh","html_url":"https://github.com/lindzh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindzh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lindzh/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

\r\nimprove code for avoid ClassCastException \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen a consumer group consumes many topics, it use only one consume thread pool to submit consume tasks.When one topic callback process cost much time,it may block other topic consume and cause message delay.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nadd consumeThreadExecutor when subscribe a topic.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

32);\r\n    offset = pullResult.getNextBeginOffset();\r\n    switch (pullResult.getPullStatus()) {\r\n        case FOUND:\r\n            printMessage(pullResult.getMsgFoundList(), charsetName, printBody);\r\n            break;\r\n        case NO_MATCHED_MSG:\r\n            System.out.printf(mq + \" no matched msg. status=%s, offset=%s\", pullResult.getPullStatus(), offset);\r\n            break;\r\n        case NO_NEW_MSG:\r\n        case OFFSET_ILLEGAL:\r\n            System.out.printf(mq + \" print msg finished. status=%s, offset=%s\", pullResult.getPullStatus(), offset);\r\n

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x ] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the async call back will be executed in a public executor which is mainly used in CHECK_TRANSACTION_STATE, NOTIFY_CONSUMER_IDS_CHANGED, CONSUME_MESSAGE_DIRECTLY, etc. More details please refer to MQClientAPIImpl.\r\n\r\nShould expose an interface for the client to specify the independent call back executor.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd an interface `setCallbackExecutor` in RemotingClient.java and DefaultMQProducer.java\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun the unit tests to verify.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the async semaphore will be released before invoking the callback, if the callback is a heavy task which is not recommended, lots of async requests will be queued in `publicExecutor` thread pool, may cause OOM or FGC.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdjust the release order between callback and response future, release semaphore after callback being finished for async invoke.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun the provided unit tests.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-12-06T07:28:27Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T13:11:02Z","closed_at":"2017-12-08T09:43:29Z","merged_at":"2017-12-08T09:43:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"cbe5197b35273a90e112c3ddbb021acc85b7bf06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/6c5a9507b4a2243c9a541bb325416502b2281dfb","head":{"label":"zhouxinyu:ROCKETMQ-323","ref":"ROCKETMQ-323","sha":"6c5a9507b4a2243c9a541bb325416502b2281dfb","user":{"login":"zhouxinyu","id":3961183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjExODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3961183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouxinyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"8c303104830afe53721fad231e671fc12670df8c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.gith

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAvoid deleting files in the middle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-30T12:56:13Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T13:11:15Z","closed_at":"2017-12-13T11:35:22Z","merged_at":"2017-12-13T11:35:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"390f73582b234e7081ad4b16a93326ab0e128df0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/198/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/198/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/198/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/d1ff11556c286d11d8041f50c92334eab6760272","head":{"label":"dongeforever:ROCKETMQ-321","ref":"ROCKETMQ-321","sha":"d1ff11556c286d11d8041f50c92334eab6760272","user":{"login":"dongeforever","id":8434428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzQ0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8434428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever","html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77119569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzExOTU2OQ==","name":"apache-rocketmq","full_name":"dongeforever/apache-rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongeforever","id":8434428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzQ0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8434428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever","html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever/apache-rocketmq","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAvoid message loss when shutdown with dispatch behind\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-30T12:52:04Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T13:11:22Z","closed_at":"2017-12-13T11:40:43Z","merged_at":"2017-12-13T11:40:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"c67413749d60682a3393f824487da0478311dd0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/197/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/197/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/197/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/c572d03366b9c0120ca8f274940b82240eed97f2","head":{"label":"dongeforever:ROCKETMQ-320","ref":"ROCKETMQ-320","sha":"c572d03366b9c0120ca8f274940b82240eed97f2","user":{"login":"dongeforever","id":8434428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzQ0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8434428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever","html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":77119569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NzExOTU2OQ==","name":"apache-rocketmq","full_name":"dongeforever/apache-rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongeforever","id":8434428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzQ0Mjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8434428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever","html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongeforever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongeforever/apache-rocketmq","description":"Mirror

there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x]  Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x]  Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ]  Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ]  Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ]  If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).","created_at":"2017-11-27T06:06:26Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T13:11:28Z","closed_at":"2017-12-08T09:43:51Z","merged_at":"2017-12-08T09:43:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"6b408ec01acc4e60171efbd583aa57540ffe7814","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/6f5e01e6fa986a78bc82f5054a048159722cd15a","head":{"label":"fuyou001:ROCKETMQ-314-1","ref":"ROCKETMQ-314-1","sha":"6f5e01e6fa986a78bc82f5054a048159722cd15a","user":{"login":"fuyou001","id":685537,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4NTUzNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/685537?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001","html_url":"https://github.com/fuyou001","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fuyou001/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"cba30897c169c7182e3f8b53ead169e5a458f13e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ap

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to make use of the Linux native libaio interfaces in cases where mmap commit log files are no longer in main memory.  Two desired changes, in theory, will be brought about: 1) GC overhead is relieved as data is no longer passed through Java heap; 2) We can continue to use zero-copy.\r\n\r\nDiscussions are welcome.\r\n\r\nThe following literature may be informative:\r\n\r\nhttps://activemq.apache.org/artemis/docs/latest/libaio.html\r\nhttps://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-async/\r\nhttps://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/jboss_enterprise_application_platform/5/html/hornetq_user_guide/libaio\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/8768083/difference-between-posix-aio-and-libaio-on-linux\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo resolve the issue [ROCKETMQ-270](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ROCKETMQ-270).\r\n\r\nSlave Broker can't flush data to disk normally if the master broker has been cleaned commit log. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nWhen the flush position is zero and the first MappedFile's start offset is non-zero, move it forward to the first MappedFile's start offset. Otherwise, slave broker can't flush data to disk normally.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. Start master broker, and write lots of messages until broker starts cleaning commit log.\r\n2. When the first commit log file isn't 00000000000000, start slave broker.\r\n3. Slave broker now can flush data normally.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [X] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [X] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [X] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [X] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [X] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-02T06:22:51Z","updated_at":"2018-06-25T13:11:42Z","closed_at":"2017-12-13T09:25:03Z","merged_at":"2017-12-13T09:25:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"3cb4bdb974b5cb1fd498dddad168a403390765fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/1","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/1/labels","id":3303406,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzMwMzQwNg==","number":1,"title":"4.3.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":54,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-04-27T06:31:35Z","updated_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z","due_on":"2018-07-23T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T02:36:28Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/f18dc03809a36bf14f6d911a3813cf6d4f606ae2","head":{"label":"zhouxinyu:ROCKETMQ-270","ref":"ROCKETMQ-270","sha":"f18dc03809a36bf14f6d911a3813cf6d4f606ae2","user":{"login":"zhouxinyu","id":3961183,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NjExODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3961183?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu","html_url":"https://github.com/zhouxinyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhouxinyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"1a88fe09757969a0c8e53b8ddb793ff449aeae25","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.gith

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-27T08:24:30Z","updated_at":"2017-11-03T02:56:51Z","closed_at":"2017-11-03T02:56:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8dac42f7c3a0bbfd39e1e22314486f4e0c515387","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/186/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/186/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/186/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/e8a5b7557571cadb30afea2cd38266a31b2410de","head":{"label":"johnsonyjl:master","ref":"master","sha":"e8a5b7557571cadb30afea2cd38266a31b2410de","user":{"login":"johnsonyjl","id":11188006,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExMTg4MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11188006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl","html_url":"https://github.com/johnsonyjl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":108515395,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDg1MTUzOTU=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"johnsonyjl/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"johnsonyjl","id":11188006,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExMTg4MDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11188006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl","html_url":"https://github.com/johnsonyjl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johnsonyjl/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/johnsonyjl/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the memory leak problem in org.apache.rocketmq.store.ha.WaitNotifyObject#waitingThreadTable\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRemove item from WaitNotifyObject#waitingThreadTable when a slave disconnect from master.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a trivial change.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/ROCKETMQ/issues/) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ROCKETMQ-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
