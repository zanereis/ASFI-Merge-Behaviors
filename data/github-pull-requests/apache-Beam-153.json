@robertwb \r\n\r\nThis change adds an initial 'sketch' of watermark tracking to the batch runner. Watermark tracking is done like so:\r\n\r\n1. If a PCollection has a delayed application, its watermark will be held at `MIN_WATERMARK`.\r\n2. If a PTransform has a channel split, its input PCollection's watermark will be held at `MIN_WATERMARK`\r\n3. For timers, an 'input pcollection' node is created for each timer family to be consumed by a transform. If a bundle execution returns a timer set at time X, the input PCollection for that timer family will be held at X. This will hold back the downstream watermarks from the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

The problem: when an intended blocking call such as `show`, `collect`\r\n   or `head` is invoked, the user sometimes doesn't realize the code is\r\n   still running and blocking. Also, the `*` prompts in notebooks are\r\n   easily ignored and sometimes buggy. We need an obvious progress\r\n   indicator to tell the user that the data/pipeline is being processed\r\n   and potentially expose more metrics about running pipelines through\r\n   the mechanism.\r\n2. Added a ProgressIndicator class that functions as a context manager\r\n   to display/remove a spinner on entering/exiting a blocking code\r\n   execution.\r\n3. Added a progress_indicated decorator to make any callable adapt the\r\n   ProgressIndicator.\r\n4. When in notebooks, a spinner is displayed. When in ipython but\r\n   without frontends, texts will be displayed on entering/exiting.\r\n   Otherwise, NOOP.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

@robertwb \r\n\r\nThese changes are mostly reshuffling of code.\r\n\r\nEach commit is a logical unit, so each commit can be reviewed separately. The commit message explains what each commit does:\r\n\r\n- **commit**[BEAM-9608] BundleManagers use BundleContextManager for configuration - (this commit modifies the BundleManagers to receive only a BundleContextManager with most of their configuration. It also adds a `dry_run` option for processing bundles without writing to `pcoll_buffers`)\r\n- **commit**[BEAM-9639] Storing side inputs after producer execution, not before consumption - (this commit ensures that side inputs are stored in state right after they are computed - not before they are consumed. this will be useful in streaming so each bundle's inputs are eagerly available)\r\n  - **commit**Ensuring downstream side inputs are calculated on fully expanded graph - (this commit is more of an accessory to the previous one. It ensures that during graph translations, downstream_side_inputs are annotated after SDFs are expanded)\r\n- **commit**[BEAM-9639] Separate Stage and Bundle execution. Improve typing. - (this commit separates the sections of the code for executing a stage such as context creation, committing of side inputs, scheduling of all bundles until no deferred inputs vs the sections of executing a bundle for that stage such as pushing data to worker, collecting bundle deferred inputs)\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Notes/todos from https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11229\r\n\r\n- [ ] It's odd that _run_stage no longer takes as a parameter the stage to run. Perhaps bundle_context_manager (and its class?) should be named stage_context or similar?\r\n- [ ] On this note, perhaps it makes sense to break FnApiRunner into the (mostly stateless) runner that can execute multiple pipelines and an executor (that has methods like run_stage) that might be stateful and is initialized with and tasked with running a single pipeline. Much of what is on context(s) would become state of self of this new object.\r\n- [ ] I was bitten by the fact that it is an error to access the process_bundle_descriptor before _extract_outputs is called. This should be clearly documented (and similarly for the other lazy attributes(s) in this class). Given that that's called external to this class and can't easily be checked, makes me wonder if the boundary of encapsulation needs to be adjusted here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

The problem: when a user reloads the browser window of a jupyter\r\n   notebook page, the javascripts of all output areas are executed\r\n   in an arbitrary order. A datatable's state is gone on the reloading,\r\n   thus causing all the javascripts to reinitialize a datatable.\r\n   When the Javascripts race with each other, a datatable can be\r\n   reinitialized multiple times indeterminably, resulting in multiple\r\n   duplicated datatable wrappers being added to the DOM. The datatable\r\n   is then rendered with multiple search and pagination web elements.\r\n2. The solution is to disable the javascripts from being executed on\r\n   reloading. There is no use of restoring a datatable's state because\r\n   the whole window is gone on reloading, thus nothing depends on the\r\n   datatable any more. And from the perspective of visualization, the\r\n   DOM with datatable web elements already presents, so no need for\r\n   datatable javascripts either.\r\n3. Changed the dataframe visualization javascripts to check if a\r\n   datatable wrapper exists before invoking an initialization. If there\r\n   is no datatable object but there is a wrapper, it means this is a\r\n   browser reloading and do nothing.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

For now, this commit adds SDF method\r\ninvokers that have functioning unit tests.

the range for pyarrow to support new pyarrow version 0.16.0\r\n\r\n> Is this a regression from a previous release?\r\n\r\nKind of. Latest version of pyarrow is not supported blocking a down stream users next release (TFX).\r\n\r\n> Is this a new feature or related to a new feature?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n> Would this impact production workloads for users?\r\n\r\nMaybe. Depends on what is pre-installed in containers. We do not need to change what is pre-installed and most users would not have an issue.\r\n\r\n> What percentage of users would be impacted by this issue if it is not fixed?\r\n\r\nTFX users.

PR is working on adding licenses for third party dependencies for Go.\r\n\r\nDesign doc: https://s.apache.org/eauq6\r\n\r\nPreviously, I proposed to use `go list` command to get dependency list and pull licenses from internet. Today, I found a tool [go-licenses](https://github.com/google/go-licenses) which detects dependencies and pull licenses. I tried it out and it worked very well, so I propose to use this tool. The design doc was updated with this change.\r\n\r\nPR for Python: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11067\r\nPR for Java: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11243\r\nPR for Go: https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/11246\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

have shown that the minimum output timestamp computation over all\r\ntimers is very expensive because we have to iterate over all keys in the state\r\nbackend. This is especially costly for RocksDB.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a cache which stores and updates the timer output\r\ntimestamps such that the minimum can be retrieved efficiently.\r\n\r\nOnly at startup the cache is populated from the state backend. This should\r\ngive us roughly the same performance as before introducing output timestamps for\r\ntimers.\r\n\r\nThe following have been run with RocksDB:\r\n\r\nNexmark Query 12 before:\r\n```\r\n

Backport of #11200.\r\n#### [BEAM-9573] Correct computing of watermark hold for timer output timestamp\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of timer output timestamps, a new watermark hold had been\r\nadded to the Flink Runner. The watermark computation works on the keyed state\r\nbackend which computes a key-scoped watermark hold and not the desired\r\noperator-wide watermark hold.\r\n\r\nComputation: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b564239081e9351c56fb0e7d263495b95dd3f8f3/runners/flink/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/flink/translation/wrappers/streaming/DoFnOperator.java#L1140\r\n\r\nKey-scoped state: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/b564239081e9351c56fb0e7d263495b95dd3f8f3/runners/flink/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/flink/translation/wrappers/streaming/DoFnOperator.java#L1130\r\n\r\nThe solution is to iterate over all available state backend keys.\r\n\r\n### Backport of #11237.\r\n#### [BEAM-9566] Mitigate performance issue for output timestamp watermark holds\r\n\r\nBenchmarks have shown that the minimum output timestamp computation over all\r\ntimers is very expensive because we have to iterate over all keys in the state\r\nbackend. This is especially costly for RocksDB.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a cache which stores and updates the timer output\r\ntimestamps such that the minimum can be retrieved efficiently.\r\n\r\nOnly at startup the cache is populated from the state backend. This should\r\ngive us roughly the same performance as before introducing output timestamps for\r\ntimers.\r\n\r\nThe following have been run with RocksDB:\r\n\r\nNexmark Query 12 before:\r\n```\r\n  Conf  Runtime(sec)    (Baseline)  Events(/sec)    (Baseline)       Results    (Baseline)\r\n  0000         105.3                       950.0                        9039\r\n  0001           2.2                      4466.3                         196\r\n```\r\n\r\nNexmark query 12 with this change:\r\n```\r\nPerformance:\r\n  Conf  Runtime(sec)    (Baseline)  Events(/sec)    (Baseline)       Results    (Baseline)\r\n  0000           6.0                     16730.8                        1919\r\n  0001           0.8                     12391.6                         196\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more details please see BEAM-9566.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang

annotations.\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-25T13:27:06Z","updated_at":"2020-03-27T09:39:34Z","closed_at":"2020-03-27T09:39:27Z","merged_at":"2020-03-27T09:39:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"9597c5b954a42ee691a43a80852f114ebd06640e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TheNeuralBit","id":675055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NTA1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/675055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit","html_url":"https://github.com/TheNeuralBit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TheNeuralBit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/11218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/11218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/11218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/3aa488d4a752b5ec3cd210e7ae9b7db4d80124d4","head":{"label":"alexvanboxel:BEAM-9605-setoption","ref":"BEAM-9605-setoption","sha":"3aa488d4a752b5ec3cd210e7ae9b7db4d80124d4","user":{"login":"alexvanboxel","id":639539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTUzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel","html_url":"https://github.com/alexvanboxel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":88551987,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4ODU1MTk4Nw==","name":"beam","full_name":"alexvanboxel/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alexvanboxel","id":639539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzOTUzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/639539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel","html_url":"https://github.com/alexvanboxel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexvanboxel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alexvanboxel/beam","description":"Mirror
