SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the custom script `docker_build_push.sh` that runs the docker builds sequentially with GitHub action jobs running in parallel.\r\n\r\n- set tags with `docker/metadata-action` GitHub Action\r\n- build images with `docker/build-push-action` GitHub Action\r\n- on release tag docker image with `docker/metadata-action` `tags: type=pep440,pattern={{version}}`\r\n\r\nNo functionality changed, except:\r\n\r\n- removes docker buildx local cache usage as every build runs on its own job hence on different machines where local cache does not apply\r\n- docker buildx cache will be a follow-up PR to use GitHub's container registry to speed up builds\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n**Use case: PR from fork** (can be verified by the successful jobs from this PR)\r\n- detect that no secrets are present\r\n- images build without failures\r\n- the subsequent steps to push the images are skipped as intended (PR from fork)\r\n- tags: (no tags)\r\n\r\n**Use case: PR from Superset repo**\r\n- detect that secrets are present\r\n- images build without failures\r\n- images push to registry\r\n- an example run

SUMMARY\r\nIn Presto DB engine spec, it is supposed to test if a table is a Presto table or Presto view by trying with `SHOW CREATE VIEW` statement. If it fails and throws a DatabaseError, then it is not a view as suggested in the comment. However, the exception is not caught at the right place, which resulted in error stacktrace showing up in the logs and also shows an error banner on the right bottom corner when fetching table schemas. Change it so that it catches the exception correctly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore, we see this exception in our service log. After we made the fix, the error is gone. From the stacktrace, you can see the error is raised on a different line instead of the previously expected one.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 3 08 49 PM](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/105950525/ed465415-1f46-47b1-a91f-490a24b252d8)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nThis will require a Presto DB connection with any table in the database. The easiest way to reproduce the error is to use sqllab, and select the table from the dropdown list. An error should show up in the logs.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThere are cases when SqlLab generates 500 errors on backend due to foreignkey violation\r\n\r\n```\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError: (pymysql.err.IntegrityError) (1452, 'Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`...`.`tab_state`, CONSTRAINT `tab_state_latest_query_id_fkey` FOREIGN KEY (`latest_query_id`) REFERENCES `query` (`client_id`) ON DELETE SET NULL)')\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe some front-end logic should be updated for this scenario too but the backend shouldn't crash with 500 in such cases anyway.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nSQLLAB_BACKEND_PERSISTENCE should be enabled.\r\n\r\n1. Open SqlLab and write a query.\r\n2. Turn off network.\r\n3. Press Run to try to run SQL query.\r\n4. Turn on network and wait a bit.\r\n\r\nExpected result:\r\nErrors are fine, but there shouldn't be 500 errors on backend.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

#25548 \r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nGoogle SDKs emit `ImportError` instead of `ModuleNotFoundError` in certain cases, depending on which packages are (not) installed. This PR fixes that by catching all import errors instead of module not found errors only.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nInstall `google-cloud-core`, or any Google SDK which depends on it (except BigQuery):\r\n\r\n    pip install google-cloud-core\r\n    pip uninstall google-cloud-bigquery\r\n\r\nObserve that Superset loads OK without emitting an ImportError.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nThis reverts commit cfda30c81a8ee06924b37db889c1d1ba77e2bc41. The original PR tries to address a host of problems caused by this breaking change to the native Trino driver: https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client/pull/220 (see changelog for 0.317: https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client/blob/master/CHANGES.md#breaking-changes-1). @dungdm93 is working on a fix for this, but it's not yet merged, and will likely require additional work on Superset before the issue is fully resolved: https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client/pull/400.

SUMMARY\r\nA change introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/25247 in MachineAuthProvider caused some custom auth providers to be broken, because of unexpected second argument passed to the constructor. This PR reverts that behaviour and .allows only passing either Selenium or Playwright override auth function, not both at the same time.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add a custom `MACHINE_AUTH_PROVIDER_CLASS` that inherits from `MachineAuthProvider` and uses an `__init__` method that accepts only 1 argument - custom auth function (existing implementations follow this pattern)\r\n2. Verify that your custom auth provider works as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\nThe `PUT /api/v1/dataset/{id}` endpoint includes the `python_date_format` validation.\r\nA PR #24113 optimizes the validation, but there's still an issue with the '%Y%m%d' format.\r\n\r\nAccording to the `DATETIME FORMAT` description, \"If the timestamp format does not adhere to the ISO 8601 standard, you will need to define an expression and type for transforming the string into a date or timestamp.\". Therefore, the validation should  be more flexible.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I have modified the logic to use the `strftime` function for validating the format string.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Edit the dataest.\r\n2. Go to the `COLUMNS` tab.\r\n3. Choose the date string column.\r\n4. Edit the `DATETIME FORMAT` to '%Y%m%d'.\r\n5. Save the dataset.\r\n6. The column can serve as the temporal filter, and the SQL expression can format the datetime to a date string using the `python_date_format`.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe navlinks were previously highlighted using click events, which meant that if a user was pushed to another portion of the site, the navlinks wouldn't highlight the correct tab that the user was located under. The proposed fix introduces logic to set the highlighted navlink based upon the url prefix rather than click events alone.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore: \r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/67f59bc0320043dcbcdc6e2715b7da44?sid=c1821e43-cfc4-43f1-a8d6-cb87674da138\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/37b1679dce32469986ae743e318c132c?sid=c97fe956-581a-4adc-a551-204794c1f586\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the GENERIC_CHART_AXES feature is enabled, the `time_range` parameter in the API request is null.\r\nConsequently, the `from_dttm` and `to_dttm` parameters rely on the `time_range` value, resulting in incorrect values being set for these parameters.\r\nSpecifically, this directly impacts the `from_dttm` and `to_dttm` variables in the Jinja as well.\r\n\r\nFixes #25301 \r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes many potential problems related to missing required properties in form data objects. The form data object is a JSON representation of a chart's configuration and it evolves over time as new features are added. Unfortunately, these objects are not versioned and their Typescript definitions refer to their latest version. This causes some problems because we may have legacy versions of a form data type that don't obey to its Typescript definition. As an example, a required property might be `null` or don't exist in a legacy version. This leads to runtime exceptions and developers adding checks for `null` values when the type definition clearly states that it shouldn't be the case. To remedy this issue, this PR adds a generic solution to make sure Typescript required fields exist during runtime.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the generic `parseFormData` function and focus on timeseries charts. The intention of this PR is to create the pattern to handle this problem and allow subsequent PRs for the other chart types.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25354\r\n\r\n###

For example, `test_constructor` and `constructor` would both throw an error. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe init containers in the helm chart do not get the same environment variables as the other pods. This causes issues when the init containers attempt to ping the database, and the database variables are overridden in environment variables.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n* Add env vars to `values.yaml`, `extraEnvRaw`, or `extraEnv` example:\r\n```yaml\r\nextraEnvRaw:\r\n  # Load DB password from other secret (e.g. for zalando operator)\r\n  - name: DB_PASS\r\n    valueFrom:\r\n      secretKeyRef:\r\n        name: superset.superset-postgres.credentials.postgresql.acid.zalan.do\r\n        key: password\r\n```\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nextraEnv:\r\n  GUNICORN_TIMEOUT: 300\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Run `helm template superset .` \r\n\r\n* Verify changes, in this case `deployment.yaml`, shortened for readability.\r\n\r\nWith no values in `envFromRaw` or `extraEnv`:\r\n```yaml\r\n# Source: superset/templates/deployment.yaml\r\n[...]\r\n      initContainers:\r\n      - command:\r\n        -
