set of improvements for iOS RPC application. The main point of changes is in build procedure and introducing support  of direct RPC connection and connection via Tracker.   \r\n\r\n**Build process improvements**\r\n* Direct linking with _tvm_runtime.dylib_. Previous approach using direct include of source files. Some users and developer face issues with with missed functionality because and have to manually add several more include lines. This patch make iOS PRC server linked with _tvm_runtime.dylib_ directly to eliminate this disadvantage. \r\n* Enabled ARC by default\r\n* Disabled _bitcode_. The latest changes in tvm build flags introduces an `-undefined,error` linker flag which is not compatible with bitcode.\r\n* Custom DSO loader is enabled by default. A lot of person are forgetting to enable it during manual build. \r\n* Move TVM_LOG_CUSTOMIZE=1 define moved from sources to project level. Previous it was leading to ODR violation is some cases.\r\n* Custom DSO sub project pointer is up. To fix internal memory leak.\r\n\r\n**UI changes**\r\n* Hide keyboard when editing is finished.\r\n* Store text fields values in app cache. No need to manually fill it each time.\r\n* Introduce mode selector \"Tracker/Proxy/PureRPC\"\r\n* Single button to connect/disconnect with enhanced size\r\n\r\n**RPC functional changes**\r\n* Introduced command line flags to run server form host side. Required to implement automatic RPC server runner. \r\n> --host_url      The tracker/proxy address, Default=0.0.0.0\"\r\n> --host_port     The tracker/proxy port, Default=9190\"\r\n> --key           The key used to identify the device type in tracker. Default=\"\"\r\n> --custom_addr   Custom IP Address to Report to RPC Tracker. Default=\"\"\r\n> --immediate_connect   No UI interconnection, connect to tracker immediately. Default=False\r\n> --verbose       Allow to print status info to std out. Default=False\r\n> --server_mode   Server mode. Can be \"pure_server\", \"proxy\" or \"tracker\".\r\n* The printing of server status into std out is added (also print information about real IP in wifi network and RPC server port). Required to check server state from  host runner.\r\n* Split ViewController and RPC Server login into different classes\r\n* Avoid using internal interface of RPCEndpoint::Create. Switched to publicly available `Registry::Get(\"rpc.CreateEventDrivenServer\")`  \r\n* Make RPC server api asynchronous. RPC server is executed in separate thread.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is a part of iOS enabling efforts. Particularly it allows to use regular TVM RPC upload mechanics in the way like for Android platform.\r\n\r\nEssential part of auto tuning on real iOS device is an ability to run kernel from module received over network. This patch allows to load shared libraries received by RPC server from host side and stored in temporal directory on device. No requirements of signing this binary.\r\n\r\n### Details of patch\r\n- New one `dso_loader` plugin specially for iOS RPC app.\r\n- The `dso_loader` itself is built on top of `macho_dyld` external module (under Apple Public Source License Version 2.0).\r\n- Dependency is downloaded automatically via CMake external project mechanics.\r\n- Added `USE_IOS_RPC` flag to enable build iOS `tvmrpc` app inside main TVM crake project \r\n- Fixed compilation and warnings(suppressed) for `tvmrpc` Xcode project\r\n- Add one more test to check `custom_dso_loader` plugin. Previous tests is still working\r\n- Add one more env var `TVM_IOS_TEAM_ID`. Allow to avoid requirements to call `init_proj.py` each time before test run.\r\n\r\n### Details of dyld module\r\nModified and simplified version of original dyld library.\r\n* Provide interfaces similar to dlopen, dlclose, dlsym and dlerror functions. Function names is prefixed with \"custom_\".\r\n* API header is under ALv2. Sources is under Apple Public Source License.\r\n* Check of binary signing is switched off.\r\n* Works only under debugger (lldb). The JIT itself is not allowed for iOS, but it has some mitigation for debuggers.\r\n* Provides very limited functionality. A lot of features are disabled or limited.","created_at":"2021-04-18T22:24:11Z","updated_at":"2023-03-27T11:50:25Z","closed_at":"2021-05-19T16:22:44Z","merged_at":"2021-05-19T16:22:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"052231969b76cd2ad14db4b1c77d53e82df72234","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

few small changes to on the DeviceAPI side.\r\n\r\n- Added kDriverVersion as an option for GetAttr.  Some of the vulkan tests seem to have driver-specific deltas, so this will help collect information.  Exposed this through `tvm._ffi.runtime_ctypes.Device` class.\r\n- Added `api_version` to python `Device` class, which was previously query-able on C++ side.\r\n- Updates to docstrings in `Device` to clarify differences between `compute_version`, `api_version`, and `driver_version`.\r\n- Updated clock speed returned by OpenCL runtime to be in kHz, consistent with units returned by cuda/rocm

PR allow static padding to take in relay expressions for the padding value.\r\n\r\nPreviously if the padding value is an expression then dynamic padding will be performed instead even if the tensor shape cane be easily calculated based on constant padding widths. The output would be a dynamically shaped tensor which is not compatible with a lot of other operations. Now, dynamic padding is dispatched only when the pad widths themselves are expressions.\r\n\r\nIn particular this is useful for quantization work where we need to pad input tensors with an appropriate and variable zero point.","created_at":"2021-04-15T18:38:07Z","updated_at":"2021-04-20T18:50:34Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T18:50:24Z","merged_at":"2021-04-20T18:50:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"78657e1f8b2c97c3acc389e2b757c6ac8174388d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7860/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7860/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7860/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5d951c6fed66e746fa693f6b95a383226c598039","head":{"label":"AndrewZhaoLuo:add-dynamic-pad-value-to-to-pad","ref":"add-dynamic-pad-value-to-to-pad","sha":"5d951c6fed66e746fa693f6b95a383226c598039","user":{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13855451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":350495744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTA0OTU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"AndrewZhaoLuo/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AndrewZhaoLuo","id":13855451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzODU1NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13855451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewZhaoLuo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewZhaoLuo/tvm","description":"Open

By default, only static libs are\r\n    generated for gtest, while TVM's build preferentially selects the shared libs.\r\n\r\n- tutorials/get_started/auto_tuning_with_python.py\r\n  - Changed norm_img_data to avoid loop, improve readability\r\n\r\n- tutorials/get_started/relay_quick_start.py\r\n  - Previous version used different input data passed to the initial and deployed module, then\r\n    asserts that the results should be the same.  Modified so that the same input data are passed in\r\n    both cases.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

have encountered a few pathological bugs in the opencl compiler provided on the snapdragon android platform (e.g. opencl compiler hung for 5+ hours in call to clBuildProgram, and non-deterministic emission of `cl_a6x_cmdbuf_mgr_submit_ibs`). I've isolated them into a minimal reproducible example, and find that they occur only when all kernels are created from a single cl_program. If instead a cl_program is created for each kernel, these issues are avoided. \r\n\r\nThis PR proposes the addition of a kernel primitive delimiter to be added to the OpenCL code generation, and for the OpenCL module runtime to utilize this delimiter to build and cache separate cl_programs for each generated kernel source.","created_at":"2021-04-13T05:31:06Z","updated_at":"2021-05-01T11:32:31Z","closed_at":"2021-05-01T11:32:13Z","merged_at":"2021-05-01T11:32:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"2215d734339ab918a53b8d4f3a770a6c65495784","assignee":{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

follow up to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7717 per discussion https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7717#issuecomment-817316477\r\n\r\nAll issues raised have been addressed. Now one UBO is allocated per `VulkanThreadEntry`, in a similar way as staging buffer. \r\n\r\nWe always allocate UBO in a host visible memory. @tqchen asked if we can assume that we can always find such memory. Actually we are already making such assumption when allocating staging buffer here https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/be87d56de011b4f18a3984ddff1da21c0675dac0/src/runtime/vulkan/vulkan.cc#L658\r\n\r\nI did find a slide https://gpuopen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Most-common-mistakes-in-Vulkan-apps.pdf where it says \"At least one memory type is host-visible & host-coherent\" (page 19) but so far I'm not finding the official statement in the spec.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the way we allocate and use UBO is similar to staging buffer, I refactored vk runtime code to cleanly support both cases.\r\n\r\nplease review

adds a new intrinsic `clz` to LLVM and SPIRV per discussion in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7669#issuecomment-800465668. \r\n\r\nThe motivation is to compute integer `ceil(log2(x))` without using log2, since SPIR-V doesn't support log2 on fp64. Using this new intrinsic, we can compute integer `ceil(log2(x))` as follows:\r\n```\r\ndef ceil_log2(x):\r\n    clz = tvm.tir.clz(x)\r\n    bits = int(x.dtype[-2:])\r\n    ceil_log2 = tvm.tir.if_then_else(x & (x - 1) == 0, bits - clz - 1, bits - clz)\r\n    return ceil_log2\r\n```\r\nLLVM has `ctlz` intrinsic which we can use directly. SPIRV doesn't have clz intrin but it does have `FindUMsb`. \r\nhttps://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-ctlz-intrinsic\r\nhttps://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/specs/1.0/GLSL.std.450.html\r\n\r\nSome discussion points:\r\n* The result is defined only for positive integers.\r\n* For now I didn't support `clz` on zero, because the LLVM doc above suggests `clz(0)` is not well supported by backends. See `is_zero_undef` argument in the llvm doc for more details.\r\n* Do we want to support `clz` on negative integers?\r\n* What about floating point?\r\n\r\n@tqchen @junrushao1994 @vinx13 @zxybazh

noted in many of @CircleSpin's recent PRs, TVMC has an excellent set of utilities to make python scripting in TVM a more approachable and intuitive experience for new users. This PR introduces an object oriented approach that we believe will be a much smoother introduction to working in TVM from Python. Before jumping into the design discussion, I want to note that we were careful to make sure that the command line TVMC workflow was minimally effected by this change.\r\n\r\nIn short, the goal this PR is to reduce a full TVM workflow into a small set of intuitive function calls, one example of which can be seen in `test_model.py`, which I'll include here for discussion.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntvmc_model = tvmc.load(onnx_resnet50)\r\ntvmc.tune(tvmc_model, target=\"llvm\")\r\ntvmc_package = tvmc.compile(tvmc_model, \"llvm\")\r\nresult = tvmc.run(tvmc_package, device=\"cpu\")\r\nprint(result) # Will print a pretty time estimator breakdown\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code uses three new classes defined in `tvmc/model.py`: `TVMCModel`, `TVMCPackage`, and `TVMCResult`. \r\n\r\nA `TVMCModel` is a wrapper around a precompiled model in TVMC. It can be generated either by calling `tvmc.load` or by pointing it to a previously saved TVMCModel. The class itself is very straightforward and most of its functionality is for saving and loading itself from disk and producing TVMCPackages. Being able to save and load TVMCModel's directly is convenient when users dont want to have to run a relay importer everytime they start up a new python instance.\r\n\r\nCalling `tvmc.compile` on a TVMCModel now will produce a package using `export_model_library_format` which was introduced in PR #7533. This format is actually very similar to what TVMC was previously using and will likely become the standard way for saving compiled artifacts going forward. The produced package is then used to create a TVMCPackage object which contains all the information needed to run the model.\r\n\r\nThe TVMCPackage is passed to `tvmc.run` which now returns a `TVMCResult`, a very simple wrapper around the runtime measurements and produced results.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear what you guys think of this flow and design and am happy to discuss any decisions in more detail. Assuming that this work is well received, we're planning on writing a tutorial for new users based on it.\r\n\r\nAlso included in this PR are a change to `auto_scheduler.HardwareParams` such that all arguments are optional. When an argument is provided as `None`, it will now extract the default value for the current target. I've also changed the default values for hardware parameters in TVMC to be None to reflect this change. This should make the default behavior of tvmc more consistent with other workflows.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this first PR is to introduce the core Python API while minimally effecting the TVMC command-line experience. In follow-up PRs, we'll work to improve both the Python API and command line API with more targeted changes.","created_at":"2021-04-12T00:02:05Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:57:23Z","closed_at":"2021-05-04T14:59:35Z","merged_at":"2021-05-04T14:59:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"18ce8e4b82369fb28f832fad78dbb1c12099a66d","assignee":{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"comaniac","id":8262694,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNjI2OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8262694?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac","html_url":"https://github.com/comaniac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/comaniac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

first run to auto scheduler. This run is necessary for checking\r\nthat the generated kernel is correct. When we just run time evaluator\r\nwith incorrect kernel then it is possible that our application on iOS\r\ndevice will be added to ignore list because of big number of committed\r\nincorrect kernels. One run before running auto scheduling helps us to\r\navoid this problem.\r\n\r\nAdded complete handlers to all command buffers in Metal runtime. It\r\nhelps to handle GPU errors and report about this error to the host\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nIn case when error happened, we have to create a new stream.

submit this PR to add quantization support for the [vision transform (vit)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) model in GPU. The main change is as follows:\r\n\r\n1, In vit model,  time-consuming operators are batch_matmul,  so we first add the compute and schedule of `batch_matmul_int8.cuda` in tvm.topi.cuda\r\n\r\n2, To support the quantization of batch_matmul, we then add `batch_matmul_rewrite` and `BatchMatmulRealize` in tvm.relay.quantize \r\n\r\n3, The kl -divergence calibrate could not preserve the accuracy of vit model well, so we add the `_percentile_scale` function \r\n\r\nFor the vit-B32-224 model, the performance is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Top-1 accuracy in Imagenet validation\r\n  - paper: 73.38\r\n  - nonofficial-model-fp32: 73.27\r\n  - nonofficial-model-int8: 72.78\r\n\r\n- The latency in GTX1660 GPU\r\n  - nonofficial-model-fp32: 10.32 ms\r\n  - nonofficial-model-int8: 4.93 ms\r\n\r\nThanks for

the following patchset be reviewed please?\r\n\r\nIt enables the Arm MPS2-AN521 board to be used on microTVM:\r\n\r\n*TARGET = tvm.target.target.micro(\"mps2_an521\")*\r\n*BOARD = \"mps2_an521-qemu\"*\r\n\r\nIt also adds to `micro_tflite.py` an example on how to run Zephyr demo in apps/  using that new target.\r\n\r\nTo use the MPS2-AN521 target it's necessary the newest Zephyr

PR adds support to SimplifyTranspose to simplify consecutive transpose<->layout_transform operations when the layout transform involves a rank expansion or contraction. The added unit test fails on main because the current SimplifyTranspose only doesn't consider the case when the layout transform and transpose may act on tensors of different rank. As an example, \r\n\r\n`NCHW4c -> LayoutTransform -> NCHW -> Transpose -> NHWC` \r\n\r\nnow simplifies to \r\n\r\n `NCHW4c -> LayoutTransform ->  NHWC`. \r\n\r\nThe reverse, rank expansion, is also

PR adds a new variant of NMS that better supports NMS in ONNX and combined NMS in TF than the existing NMS operator in TOPI/Relay. For now, I'm calling this variant of NMS \"All class NMS\".\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/master/docs/Operators.md#NonMaxSuppression\r\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image/combined_non_max_suppression\r\n\r\nThe biggest difference between our NMS and \"All class NMS\" is that in our NMS, a single box is associated with a single class, while in the latter case a single box has scores for all classes, and NMS is performed for each class separately. `max_out_size` parameter is also applied per class, rather than to all boxes as in our implementation.\r\n\r\nUntil now, we've been supporting this variant of NMS via complicated encodings  using our implementation of NMS. It kind of \"works\" in practice, but there are many problems to it:\r\n* ONNX NMS converter https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/6839 is extremely complicated, and performance is bad because it does small NMS repeatedly inside Relay while loop. It also easily introduces the \"zero box problem\", because \"All class NMS\" encoded via one-class NMS is more likely to result in zero detection. We needed to add an ad hoc patch like https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7691 to workaround this problem. \r\n* https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/7520 has a bug in `max_out_size` handling. Since in our NMS `max_out_size` is applied to all boxes, we cannot translate \"All class NMS\" into a single call to our NMS. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I decided it is better to introduce a new variant of NMS to overcome these pains. This breaks our general \"one operator to support all frameworks\" philosophy, but the two variants of NMS are so different it doesn't make sense to call them the same op.\r\n\r\nThe result is significant: using the new NMS, I got speedup of **1 second** on mlperf SSD resnet34, running on vk + amd. This is an extreme case in that the existing approach that calls `get_valid_counts` and `non_maximum_surpression` 80 times in a while loop is extremely slow on vk + amd for some reason, taking literally 1 second. Now it is only **5.7 milli second**.\r\n\r\n## Implementation details\r\nThe new NMS implementation consists of the following steps:\r\n* Sort scores and return *both* sorted scores and indices. The existing NMS only uses sorted indices, while I also used sorted scores to do binary search, next.\r\n* Do binary search on sorted scores to find the index of the box whose score is just below `score_threshold`. This gives what we call `valid_count[i]` in the existing NMS, computed by `get_valid_counts`.\r\n* Do NMS, parallelized over batch * class. The inner loop uses the same NMS IR as the existing one.\r\n*  After the previous step, we end up with indices of size `(batch * num_class, num_boxes)` and a tensor `num_detections` of size `(batch * num_class,)` holding the number of survived boxes per row. We need to copy `num_detections[i]` indices from each row into a one linear output. This is a perfect application of exclusive scan:  Doing ex scan on `num_detections` gives row offsets to write into for each row.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the new implementation comes from:\r\n* `get_valid_count` call is replaced with binary search\r\n* Per class independent NMS are done in parallel across different blocks on GPU. This alone gives `num_class`x speedup over the existing encoding in ONNX / TF frontend.\r\n* The ONNX NMS frontend is now trivial and there is no triple nested loop etc. It seems overhead on the host side is very large on vk + amd.","created_at":"2021-04-05T06:00:32Z","updated_at":"2021-04-14T19:19:16Z","closed_at":"2021-04-14T19:18:54Z","merged_at":"2021-04-14T19:18:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"390b4d1ce32533810fc8d65dcf211f6d147764aa","assignee":{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mbrookhart","id":4065489,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNjU0ODk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4065489?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart","html_url":"https://github.com/mbrookhart","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mbrookhart/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

PR adds an optional field `desc` to AutoScheduler's `SearchTask`. When extracting the tasks, this field will be used to store the Relay function name it was extracted from (e.g., `fused_nn.conv2d`). This would be useful if users only want to tune some tasks in a network. For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntasks, weights = extract_tasks(...)\r\nfor task, weight in zip(tasks, weights):\r\n  if \"conv2d\" not in task.desc:\r\n    # throw away this task\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is also useful if users are interested in what function the compute DAG represents.\r\n\r\ncc @merrymercy @jcf94 @FrozenGene

condition.\r\n","created_at":"2021-04-01T00:45:41Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:56:00Z","closed_at":"2021-04-04T00:36:45Z","merged_at":"2021-04-04T00:36:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"91311b3485dfae1592d316588f0a13ec6a96dc0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7781/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7781/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7781/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/a765b70943743221ba673be7bbcb4ba5ee2b3949","head":{"label":"jwfromm:pop_bad","ref":"pop_bad","sha":"a765b70943743221ba673be7bbcb4ba5ee2b3949","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

I think it \r\nit is clearer now since it is clear in the readme that ``build.sh`` can be used to only build\r\nthe image and optionally run commands in the image that has been just

the following changes be reviewed please?\r\n\r\nThey aim to make microTVM (HEAD) work again for STM32F746 disco board.\r\n\r\nCommit c39a6e25d \"Clean up uTVM demo runtime, add ONNX model test and\r\ntutorial (#7557)\" changed the location of the Zephyr code example to\r\napps/ so this commit updates the tutorial examples under tutorials/micro\r\nto reflect the new location where src/main.c resides.\r\n\r\nSince commit c39a6e25d also split Zephyr configuration per boards,\r\nunder project's boards/, this commits also adds a proper config for the\r\nSTM32F746 Discovery board and fixes a nit in the comment in\r\nboards/nucleo_f746zg.conf. It also removes CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=50 for\r\ndisco and nucleo boards since the MCUs for both boads are Cortex-m7\r\nbased, not Contex-m33.\r\n\r\nFor the new boards/stm32f746g_disco.conf board config file\r\n\r\nCONFIG_TEST_RANDOM_GENERATOR=y is set\r\n\r\notherwise when CONFIG_ENTROPY_GENERATOR=y linkage will fail with:\r\n\r\nrand32.h:33: undefined reference to `z_impl_sys_rand32_get'\r\n\r\nFinally this commit sets the UART ring buffer size back to 512 bytes,\r\nonly for disco and nucleo boards, otherwise the new value introduced\r\nby commit c39a6e25d makes noinit section not fitting the SRAM region\r\non these devices, so linkage fails with:\r\n\r\nld: zephyr_prebuilt.elf section `noinit' will not fit in region `SRAM'\r\nld: section .intList VMA [0000000020050000,00000000200500e7] overlaps section noinit VMA [000000002004f5d8,0000000020050317]\r\nld: region `SRAM' overflowed by 792 bytes\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gustavo Romero

regards,\r\nGustavo\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-30T17:31:59Z","updated_at":"2021-04-06T22:22:01Z","closed_at":"2021-04-06T22:18:38Z","merged_at":"2021-04-06T22:18:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"1386c48930fb00b098a26eed85f49ac679c27d0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7772/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/7772/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/7772/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/d05da61270943f83ecedb5acdee88fae9dbbd4ac","head":{"label":"gromero:for-review-broken-disco","ref":"for-review-broken-disco","sha":"d05da61270943f83ecedb5acdee88fae9dbbd4ac","user":{"login":"gromero","id":3375505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzU1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3375505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero","html_url":"https://github.com/gromero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":328811256,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg4MTEyNTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"gromero/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gromero","id":3375505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzU1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3375505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero","html_url":"https://github.com/gromero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gromero/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gromero/tvm","description":"Open

guys!\r\n\r\nAfter trying the VM in TVM, I found that the default memory allocator(PooledAllocator) doesn't work very well: in case of dynamic inputs, the size of used buffers are different from inference to inference and PooledAllocator cached buffers based on the size. Therefore, it ends with out of device memory. \r\n\r\nThis patch doesn't aim to solve this problem, since memory allocation is a very complicated issue. I believe users should have the choice to implement whatever suits their needs the most. In addition, the cost of allowing users to register and use their customized allocator is little to none: Registery::Get gets called only once. \r\n\r\nI suppose @wweic is the reviewer for VM, what's your opinion?  \r\n\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: JasonL <MuchToMyDelight@sers.noreply.github.com>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!
