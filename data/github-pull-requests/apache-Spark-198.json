Support partial grouping analytics such as `group by a, cube(a, b)`\r\n2. Support mixed grouping analytics such as `group by cube(a, b), rollup(b,c)`\r\n\r\n*Partial Groupings*\r\n\r\n    Partial Groupings means there are both `group_expression` and `CUBE|ROLLUP|GROUPING SETS`\r\n    in GROUP BY clause. For example:\r\n    `GROUP BY warehouse, CUBE(product, location)` is equivalent to\r\n    `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS((warehouse, product, location), (warehouse, product), (warehouse, location), (warehouse))`.\r\n    `GROUP BY warehouse, ROLLUP(product, location)` is equivalent to\r\n    `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS((warehouse, product, location), (warehouse, product), (warehouse))`.\r\n    `GROUP BY warehouse, GROUPING SETS((product, location), (producet), ())` is equivalent to\r\n    `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS((warehouse, product, location), (warehouse, location), (warehouse))`.\r\n\r\n*Concatenated Groupings*\r\n  \r\n    Concatenated groupings offer a concise way to generate useful combinations of groupings. Groupings specified\r\n    with concatenated groupings yield the cross-product of groupings from each grouping set. The cross-product \r\n    operation enables even a small number of concatenated groupings to generate a large number of final groups. \r\n    The concatenated groupings are specified simply by listing multiple `GROUPING SETS`, `CUBES`, and `ROLLUP`, \r\n    and separating them with commas. For example:\r\n    `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS((warehouse), (producet)), GROUPING SETS((location), (size))` is equivalent to \r\n    `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS((warehouse, location), (warehouse, size), (product, location), (product, size))`.\r\n    `GROUP BY CUBE((warehouse), (producet)), ROLLUP((location), (size))` is equivalent to \r\n    `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS((warehouse, product), (warehouse), (producet), ()), GROUPING SETS((location, size), (location), ())`\r\n    `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(\r\n        (warehouse, product, location, size), (warehouse, product, location), (warehouse, product),\r\n        (warehouse, location, size), (warehouse, location), (warehouse),\r\n        (product, location, size), (product, location), (product),\r\n        (location, size), (location), ())`.\r\n    `GROUP BY order, CUBE((warehouse), (producet)), ROLLUP((location), (size))` is equivalent to \r\n    `GROUP BY order, GROUPING SETS((warehouse, product), (warehouse), (producet), ()), GROUPING SETS((location, size), (location), ())`\r\n    `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS(\r\n        (order, warehouse, product, location, size), (order, warehouse, product, location), (order, warehouse, product),\r\n        (order, warehouse, location, size), (order, warehouse, location), (order, warehouse),\r\n        (order, product, location, size), (order, product, location), (order, product),\r\n        (order, location, size), (order, location), (order))`.\r\n    \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSupport more flexible grouping analytics\r\n \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can use sql like\r\n```\r\nselect a, b, c, agg_expr() from table group by a, cube(b, c)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis reinstates the old option `spark.sql.sources.write.jobUUID` to set a unique jobId in the jobconf so that hadoop MR committers have a unique ID which is (a) consistent across tasks and workers and (b) not brittle compared to generated-timestamp job IDs. The latter matches that of what JobID requires, but as they are generated per-thread, may not always be unique within a cluster.\r\n       \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIf a committer (e.g s3a staging committer) uses job-attempt-ID as a unique ID then any two jobs started within the same second have the same ID, so can clash.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nGood Q. It is \"developer-facing\" in the context of anyone writing a committer. But it reinstates a property which was in Spark 1.x and \"went away\"\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTesting: no test here. You'd have to create a new committer which extracted the value in both job and task(s) and verified consistency. That is possible (with a task output whose records contained the UUID), but it would be pretty convoluted and a high maintenance cost.\r\n       \r\nBecause it's trying to address a race condition, it's hard to regenerate the problem downstream and so verify a fix in a test run...I'll just look at the logs to see what temporary dir is being used in the cluster FS and verify it's a UUID","created_at":"2020-10-23T14:13:03Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T15:29:31Z","closed_at":"2020-10-26T19:31:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7106c684c4d7b7e8720dbcd9b699d42cfa1c5f47","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30141/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30141/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30141/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cfbb49d7155f50bcbe82e436d7db8447aa53d920","head":{"label":"steveloughran:SPARK-33230-jobId","ref":"SPARK-33230-jobId","sha":"cfbb49d7155f50bcbe82e436d7db8447aa53d920","user":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32387210,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM4NzIxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"steveloughran/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"steveloughran","id":162090,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjA5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162090?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran","html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/steveloughran/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/steveloughran/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFollowup from #27831 , origin author @chrysan.\r\n\r\nEach request it will check `chunksBeingTransferred `\r\n```\r\npublic long chunksBeingTransferred() {\r\n    long sum = 0L;\r\n    for (StreamState streamState: streams.values()) {\r\n      sum += streamState.chunksBeingTransferred.get();\r\n    }\r\n    return sum;\r\n

number of chunks being transferred {} is above {}, close the connection.\",\r\n        chunksBeingTransferred, maxChunksBeingTransferred);\r\n      channel.close();\r\n      return;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIt will  traverse `streams` repeatedly and we know that fetch data chunk will access `stream` too,  there cause two problem:\r\n\r\n1. repeated traverse `streams`, the longer the length, the longer the time\r\n2. lock race in ConcurrentHashMap `streams`\r\n\r\nIn this PR, when `maxChunksBeingTransferred` use default value, we avoid compute `chunksBeingTransferred ` since we don't  care about this.  If user want to set this configuration and meet performance problem,  you can also backport PR #27831 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpeed up  getting `chunksBeingTransferred`  and avoid lock race in object `streams`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisted

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR is to enable auto bucketed table scan by default, with exception to only disable for cached query (similar to AQE). The reason why disabling auto scan for cached query is that, the cached query output partitioning can be leveraged later to avoid shuffle and sort when doing join and aggregate.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nEnable auto bucketed table scan by default is useful as it can optimize query automatically under the hood, without users interaction.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test for cached query in `DisableUnnecessaryBucketedScanSuite.scala`. Also change a bunch of unit tests which should disable auto bucketed scan to make them work.","created_at":"2020-10-23T07:45:57Z","updated_at":"2021-05-08T08:10:20Z","closed_at":"2020-10-26T11:23:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf62e4997422a99939c537e38294de9344620fe8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/070da002a72ec78cca772404806c44cd2e07d6b0","head":{"label":"c21:enable-auto-bucket","ref":"enable-auto-bucket","sha":"070da002a72ec78cca772404806c44cd2e07d6b0","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to exclude `org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager:jar:tests` from `hadoop-yarn-server-tests` when we use Hadoop 2 profile.\r\n\r\nFor some reasons, after SBT 1.3 upgrade at SPARK-21708, SBT starts to pull the dependencies of 'hadoop-yarn-server-tests'  with 'tests' classifier:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg/apache/hadoop/hadoop-common/2.7.4/hadoop-common-2.7.4-tests.jar\r\norg/apache/hadoop/hadoop-yarn-common/2.7.4/hadoop-yarn-common-2.7.4-tests.jar\r\norg/apache/hadoop/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/2.7.4/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager-2.7.4-tests.jar\r\n```\r\nthese were not pulled before the upgrade.\r\n\r\nThis specific `hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager-2.7.4-tests.jar` causes the problem (SPARK-33104)\r\n\r\n1. When the test case creates the Hadoop configuration here, \r\n    https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/cc06266ade5a4eb35089501a3b32736624208d4c/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkHadoopUtil.scala#L122\r\n\r\n2. Such jars above have higher precedence in the class path, instead of the specified custom `core-site.xml` in the test:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/e93b8f02cd706bedc47c9b55a73f632fe9e61ec3/resource-managers/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/Client.scala#L1375\r\n\r\n3. Later, `core-site.xml` in the jar is picked instead in Hadoop's `Configuration`:\r\n\r\n    Before this fix:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    jar:file:/.../https/maven-central.storage-download.googleapis.com/maven2/org/apache/hadoop/\r\n    hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/2.7.4/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager-2.7.4-tests.jar!/core-site.xml\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    After this fix:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    file:/.../spark/resource-managers/yarn/target/org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterSuite/\r\n    org.apache.spark.deploy.yarn.YarnClusterSuite-localDir-nm-0_0/\r\n    usercache/.../filecache/10/__spark_conf__.zip/__hadoop_conf__/core-site.xml\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. the `core-site.xml` in the jar of course does not contain:\r\n\r\n    https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2cfd215dc4fb1ff6865644fec8284ba93dcddd5c/resource-managers/yarn/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/YarnClusterSuite.scala#L133-L141\r\n\r\n    and the specific test fails.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses some kind of hacky approach. It was excluded from  'hadoop-yarn-server-tests'  with 'tests' classifier, and then added back as a proper dependency (when Hadoop 2 profile is used). In this way, SBT does not pull `hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager` with `tests` classifier anymore.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the build pass. This is a blocker.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested and debugged:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbuild/sbt clean \"yarn/testOnly *.YarnClusterSuite -- -z SparkHadoopUtil\" -Pyarn -Phadoop-2.7 -Phive

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Replace the metadata key `org.apache.spark.int96NoRebase` by `org.apache.spark.legacyINT96`.\r\n2. Change the condition when new key should be saved to parquet metadata: it should be saved when the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite` is set to `LEGACY`.\r\n3. Change handling the metadata key in read:\r\n    - If there is no the key in parquet metadata, take the rebase mode from the SQL config: `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInRead`\r\n    - If parquet files were saved by Spark < 3.1.0, use the `LEGACY` rebasing mode for INT96 type.\r\n    - For files written by Spark >= 3.1.0, if the `org.apache.spark.legacyINT96` presents in metadata, perform rebasing otherwise don't. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To not increase parquet size by default when `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite` is `EXCEPTION` after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30121.\r\n- To have the implementation similar to `org.apache.spark.legacyDateTime`\r\n- To minimise impact on other subsystems that are based on file sizes like gathering statistics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModified test in `ParquetIOSuite`","created_at":"2020-10-22T12:02:24Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:28:51Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T15:57:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e9b7b93dc89284a22b641e9a463be00c02b93e3c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30132/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30132/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30132/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/158ab4f96a16c1e264f703870aa129af1f95ad57","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:int96-flip-metadata-rebase-key","ref":"int96-flip-metadata-rebase-key","sha":"158ab4f96a16c1e264f703870aa129af1f95ad57","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis updates the misleading log messages for removed shuffle block during migration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. For the deleted shuffle blocks, `IndexShuffleBlockResolver` shows users WARN message saying `skipping migration`. However, `BlockManagerDecommissioner` shows users INFO message including `Migrated ShuffleBlockInfo(...)` inconsistently. Technically, we didn't migrated. We should not show `Migrated` message in this case.\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO BlockManagerDecommissioner: Trying to migrate shuffle ShuffleBlockInfo(109,18924) to BlockManagerId(...) (2 / 3)\r\nWARN IndexShuffleBlockResolver: Failed to resolve shuffle block ShuffleBlockInfo(109,18924), skipping migration. This is expected to occur if a block is removed after decommissioning has started.\r\nINFO BlockManagerDecommissioner: Got migration sub-blocks List()\r\n...\r\nINFO BlockManagerDecommissioner: Migrated ShuffleBlockInfo(109,18924) to BlockManagerId(...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. In addition, if the shuffle file is deleted while the information is in the queue, the above messages are repeated multiple times, `spark.storage.decommission.maxReplicationFailuresPerBlock`. We had better use one line instead of the group of messages for that case.\r\n```\r\nINFO BlockManagerDecommissioner: Trying to migrate shuffle ShuffleBlockInfo(109,18924) to BlockManagerId(...) (0 / 3)\r\n...\r\nINFO BlockManagerDecommissioner: Trying to migrate shuffle ShuffleBlockInfo(109,18924) to BlockManagerId(...) (1 / 3)\r\n...\r\nINFO BlockManagerDecommissioner: Trying to migrate shuffle ShuffleBlockInfo(109,18924) to BlockManagerId(...) (2 / 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Skipping or not is a role of `BlockManagerDecommissioner` class. `IndexShuffleBlockResolver.getMigrationBlocks` is used twice differently like the following. We had better inform users at `BlockManagerDecommissioner` once.\r\n    - At the beginning, to get the sub-blocks.\r\n    - In case of `IOException`, to determine whether ignoring it or re-throwing. And, `BlockManagerDecommissioner` shows WARN message (`Skipping block ...`) again.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is an update for log message info to be consistent.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-22T06:22:52Z","updated_at":"2020-10-22T09:57:09Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T08:10:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5304164ce453d825084838d8e712796e8746ba6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30129/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30129/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30129/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a7ebed6f82dd9b045b0d7718afc155412fc619b8","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-33218","ref":"SPARK-33218","sha":"a7ebed6f82dd9b045b0d7718afc155412fc619b8","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"cb3fa6c9368e64184a5f7b19688181d11de9511c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to set the upper bound of PyArrow and Pandas versions to 0.12.0 and 0.24.0 respectively.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/16990f929921b3f784a85f3afbe1a22fbe77d895 and https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/07a9885f2792be1353f4a923d649e90bc431cb38 were not ported back so it fails the tests.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/16990f929921b3f784a85f3afbe1a22fbe77d895 contains Arrow dependency upgrade so it cannot be cleanly ported back.\r\n\r\nNote that I _think_ these tests were broken from the very first place at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/7c65f7680ffbe2c03e444ec60358cbf912c27d13#diff-bdcc6a2a85f645f62724fe8dafbf0581cb0c1d65f6a76cb2985a9172e31a473c. There was one flaky test in ML that stops other tests so SQL and Arrow related tests were not shown.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. Spark 2.4.x already declared that higher versions might not work at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.4/docs/sql-pyspark-pandas-with-arrow.md#recommended-pandas-and-pyarrow-versions.\r\n\r\n2. We're currently unable to test all combinations (due to the lack of resources in GitHub Actions, see SPARK-32264). It should be best to pick one combination to test.\r\n\r\n3. Just to clarify, Spark 2.4 works with the latest PyArrow and pandas 99% correctly. Most of are just test only issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions in this build should test.","created_at":"2020-10-22T04:20:56Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:05:33Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T09:18:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"17dce623ed4b0ca6270bcf7fdd38ca0d14f79609","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30128/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30128/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30128/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ad3e67eba43f9b77ae889552414b1a264d622f38","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33217","ref":"SPARK-33217","sha":"ad3e67eba43f9b77ae889552414b1a264d622f38","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch separates the view permission checks from the getAppUi in FsHistoryServerProvider, thus enabling SHS to do view permissions check of a given attempt for a given user without rebuilding the UI. This is achieved by adding a method \"checkUIViewPermissions(appId: String, attemptId: Option[String], user: String): Boolean\" to many layers of history server components. Currently, this feature is useful for event log download.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRight now, when we want to download the event logs from the spark history server, SHS will need to parse entire the event log to rebuild UI, and this is just for view permission checks. UI rebuilding is a time-consuming and memory-intensive task, especially for large logs. However, this process is unnecessary for event log download. With this patch, UI rebuild can be skipped when downloading event logs from the history server. Thus the time of downloading a GB scale event log can be reduced from several minutes to several seconds, and the memory consumption of UI rebuilding can be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases to confirm the view permission checks work properly and download event logs won't trigger UI loading. Also did some manual tests to verify the download speed can be drastically improved and the authentication works properly.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-22T01:33:57Z","updated_at":"2020-10-27T17:36:59Z","closed_at":"2020-10-27T05:29:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83f0aac0d0dd65c862a798787dfae5f30a90eeca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d8d78c7cb0eb757231edeaf5d27fd59bf77c02e3","head":{"label":"baohe-zhang:bypass_ui_rebuild_for_log_download","ref":"bypass_ui_rebuild_for_log_download","sha":"d8d78c7cb0eb757231edeaf5d27fd59bf77c02e3","user":{"login":"baohe-zhang","id":26694233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njk0MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26694233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/baohe-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":256324311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTYzMjQzMTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"baohe-zhang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"baohe-zhang","id":26694233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njk0MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26694233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/baohe-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/baohe-zhang/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR changes `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` to, by default, use a standard temporary directory to store the Spark binaries that it localizes. It additionally adds a new System property, `spark.test.cache-dir`, which can be used to define a static location into which the Spark binary will be localized to allow for sharing between test executions. If the System property is used, the downloaded binaries won't be deleted after the test runs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn SPARK-22356 (PR #19579), the `sparkTestingDir` used by `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` became hard-coded to enable re-use of the downloaded Spark tarball between test executions:\r\n```\r\n  // For local test, you can set `sparkTestingDir` to a static value like `/tmp/test-spark`, to\r\n  // avoid downloading Spark of different versions in each run.\r\n  private val sparkTestingDir = new File(\"/tmp/test-spark\")\r\n```\r\nHowever this doesn't work, since it gets deleted every time:\r\n```\r\n  override def afterAll(): Unit = {\r\n    try {\r\n      Utils.deleteRecursively(wareHousePath)\r\n      Utils.deleteRecursively(tmpDataDir)\r\n      Utils.deleteRecursively(sparkTestingDir)\r\n    } finally {\r\n      super.afterAll()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's bad that we're hard-coding to a `/tmp` directory, as in some cases this is not the proper place to store temporary files. We're not currently making any good use of it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nDeveloper-facing changes only, as this is in a test.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe test continues to execute as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Set the default value for the SQL configs `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite` and `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInRead` to `EXCEPTION`.\r\n2. Update the SQL migration guide.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrent default value `LEGACY` may lead to shifting timestamps in read or in write. We should leave the decision about rebasing to users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites like `ParquetIOSuite`.","created_at":"2020-10-21T17:16:06Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:28:50Z","closed_at":"2020-10-22T03:05:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac2e3716ef7266811a0911b696cc26dc54ff7bbf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30121/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30121/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30121/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/33bb5c24dbdaa74fe45f70f172e3943ec3c15aab","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:int96-exception-by-default","ref":"int96-exception-by-default","sha":"33bb5c24dbdaa74fe45f70f172e3943ec3c15aab","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe page returned by /jobs in Spark UI will  store the detail information of each job in javascript like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  'className': 'executor added',\r\n  'group': 'executors',\r\n  'start': new Date(1602834008978),\r\n  'content': '<div class=\"executor-event-content\"' +\r\n    'data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\"' +\r\n    'data-title=\"Executor 3<br>' +\r\n    'Added at 2020/10/16 15:40:08\"' +\r\n    'data-html=\"true\">Executor 3 added</div>'\r\n}\r\n```\r\nif an application has a failed job, the failure reason corresponding to the job will be stored in the ` content`  field in the javascript . if the failure  reason contains the character: **'**,   the  javascript code will throw an exception to cause the `event timeline url` had no response ， The following is an example of error json:\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  'className': 'executor removed',\r\n  'group': 'executors',\r\n  'start': new Date(1602925908654),\r\n  'content': '<div class=\"executor-event-content\"' +\r\n    'data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\"' +\r\n    'data-title=\"Executor 2<br>' +\r\n    'Removed at 2020/10/17 17:11:48' +\r\n    '<br>Reason: Container from a bad node: ...   20/10/17 16:00:42 WARN ShutdownHookManager: ShutdownHook **'$anon$2'** timeout...\"' +\r\n    'data-html=\"true\">Executor 2 removed</div>'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we need to considier this special case , if the returned job info contains the character:**'**, just remove it\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nEnsure that the UI page can function normally\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis pr only  fixes an exception in a special case, manual test works well.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-21T11:44:08Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T11:09:39Z","closed_at":"2020-10-26T12:42:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21ef5f58a9f6a9eed0d3c7fd4bc502f9d9688421","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30119/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30119/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30119/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/76093ad5798b551f78ac0625ed86daf280114a4a","head":{"label":"echohlne:timeline_view_cannot_open","ref":"timeline_view_cannot_open","sha":"76093ad5798b551f78ac0625ed86daf280114a4a","user":{"login":"echohlne","id":52202080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjAyMDgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52202080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne","html_url":"https://github.com/echohlne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/echohlne/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"dcb08204339e2291727be8e1a206e272652f9ae4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

`migratingShuffles` is defined like the following, `migratingShuffles.size > numMigratedShuffles.get()` means the migration is not finished.\r\n```scala\r\n// Shuffles which are either in queue for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a small followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28793 and  proposes to use `is_categorical_dtype` instead of deprecated `is_categorical`.\r\n\r\n`is_categorical_dtype` exists from minimum pandas version we support (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.23.2/pandas/core/dtypes/api.py), and `is_categorical` was deprecated from pandas 1.1.0 (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commit/87a1cc21cab751c16fda4e6f0a95988a8d90462b).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid using deprecated APIs, and remove warnings.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will remove warnings that says `is_categorical` is deprecated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy running any pandas UDF with pandas 1.1.0+: \r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf\r\n\r\ndef func(x: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:\r\n    return x\r\n\r\nspark.range(10).select(pandas_udf(func, \"long\")(\"id\")).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/.../python/lib/pyspark.zip/pyspark/sql/pandas/serializers.py:151: FutureWarning: is_categorical is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.  Use is_categorical_dtype

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd an environment variable `PYARROW_IGNORE_TIMEZONE` to pyspark tests in run-tests.py to use legacy nested timestamp behavior. This means that when converting arrow to pandas, nested timestamps with timezones will have the timezone localized during conversion.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe default behavior was changed in PyArrow 2.0.0 to propagate timezone information. Using the environment variable enables testing with newer versions of pyarrow until the issue can be fixed in SPARK-32285.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark already supports filtered aggregations (explanation of their behavior [here](https://modern-sql.com/feature/filter)):\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val df = spark.range(100)\r\nscala> df.registerTempTable(\"df\")\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select count(1) as classic_cnt, count(1) FILTER (WHERE id < 50) from df\").show()\r\n+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+ \r\n|classic_cnt|count(1) FILTER (WHERE (id < CAST(50 AS BIGINT)))|\r\n+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+\r\n|        100|                                               50|\r\n+-----------+-------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this syntax is not exposed when manipulating columns and functions.\r\n\r\nThis PRs adds the `filtered` function and allows the following syntax with the same behaviour as above:\r\n```\r\ndf.select(filtered(count(lit(1)), where=df(\"id\") < 50)).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese aggregations are especially useful when filtering on overlapping datasets (where a pivot would not work):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT \r\n AVG(revenue) FILTER (WHERE age < 25),\r\n AVG(revenue) FILTER (WHERE age < 35),\r\n AVG(revenue) FILTER (WHERE age < 45)\r\nFROM people;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, a new function and a simplification of filtered aggregations definition (see above)\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest was added.\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-20T17:29:05Z","updated_at":"2020-10-21T09:57:56Z","closed_at":"2020-10-21T09:57:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a88cbfad355da9ef273b4ccf8e74a3e4a0916cfc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30107/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30107/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30107/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f71b756514579921f251861807ed3c9eec99d67b","head":{"label":"tools4origins:filteredAggregationFunction","ref":"filteredAggregationFunction","sha":"f71b756514579921f251861807ed3c9eec99d67b","user":{"login":"tools4origins","id":8068386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNjgzODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8068386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins","html_url":"https://github.com/tools4origins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192364761,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTIzNjQ3NjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"tools4origins/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tools4origins","id":8068386,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNjgzODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8068386?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins","html_url":"https://github.com/tools4origins","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tools4origins/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tools4origins/spark","description":"Apache

there's no change in YARN codes. See also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29843#issuecomment-712540024\r\n\r\nThe root cause seems like the paths are different, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29843#pullrequestreview-502595199. I _think_ Jenkins uses a different Python executable via Anaconda and the executor side does not know where it is for some reasons.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix it just by explicitly specifying the absolute path for Python executable so the tests should pass in any environment.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make tests pass.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis issue looks specific to Jenkins. It should run the tests on Jenkins.","created_at":"2020-10-20T07:53:37Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:06:55Z","closed_at":"2020-10-20T15:32:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"007cbc74b034e720fbfcedecfc60040a77bc5bbd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30099/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30099/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30099/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ccabb048670a132d98bdc33e2677cea25e68ebf1","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-33191","ref":"SPARK-33191","sha":"ccabb048670a132d98bdc33e2677cea25e68ebf1","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently when run in `cluster` mode on YARN, the Spark `yarn.Client` will print out the application report into the logs, to be easily viewed by users. For example:\r\n```\r\nINFO yarn.Client: \r\n \t client token: Token { kind: YARN_CLIENT_TOKEN, service:  }\r\n \t diagnostics: N/A\r\n \t ApplicationMaster host: X.X.X.X\r\n \t ApplicationMaster RPC port: 0\r\n \t queue: default\r\n \t start time: 1602782566027\r\n \t final status: UNDEFINED\r\n \t tracking URL: http://hostname:8888/proxy/application_<id>/\r\n \t user: xkrogen\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose adding, alongside the application report, some additional lines like:\r\n```\r\n         Driver Logs (stdout): http://hostname:8042/node/containerlogs/container_<id>/xkrogen/stdout?start=-4096\r\n         Driver Logs (stderr): http://hostname:8042/node/containerlogs/container_<id>/xkrogen/stderr?start=-4096\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis information isn't contained in the `ApplicationReport`, so it's necessary to query the ResourceManager REST API. For now I have added this as an always-on feature, but if there is any concern about adding this REST dependency, I think hiding this feature behind an off-by-default flag is reasonable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTypically, the tracking URL can be used to find the logs of the ApplicationMaster/driver while the application is running. Later, the Spark History Server can be used to track this information down, using the stdout/stderr links on the Executors page.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the situation when the driver crashed _before_ writing out a history file, the SHS may not be aware of this application, and thus does not contain links to the driver logs. When this situation arises, it can be difficult for users to debug further, since they can't easily find their driver logs.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to reach the logs by using the `yarn logs` commands, but the average Spark user isn't aware of this and shouldn't have to be.\r\n\r\nWith this information readily available in the logs, users can quickly jump to their driver logs, even if it crashed before the SHS became aware of the application. This has the additional benefit of providing a quick way to access driver logs, which often contain useful information, in a single click (instead of navigating through the Spark UI).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, some additional print statements will be created in the application report when using YARN in cluster mode.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests for the parsing logic in `yarn.ClientSuite`. Also tested against a live cluster. When the driver is running:\r\n```\r\nINFO Client: Application report for application_XXXXXXXXX_YYYYYY (state: RUNNING)\r\nINFO Client:\r\n         client token: Token { kind: YARN_CLIENT_TOKEN, service:  }\r\n         diagnostics: N/A\r\n         ApplicationMaster host: host.example.com\r\n         ApplicationMaster RPC port: ######\r\n         queue: queue_name\r\n         start time: 1604529046091\r\n         final status: UNDEFINED\r\n         tracking URL: http://host.example.com:8080/proxy/application_XXXXXXXXX_YYYYYY/\r\n         user: xkrogen\r\n         Driver Logs (stdout): http://host.example.com:8042/node/containerlogs/container_e07_XXXXXXXXX_YYYYYY_01_000001/xkrogen/stdout?start=-4096\r\n         Driver Logs (stderr): http://host.example.com:8042/node/containerlogs/container_e07_XXXXXXXXX_YYYYYY_01_000001/xkrogen/stderr?start=-4096\r\nINFO Client: Application report for application_XXXXXXXXX_YYYYYY (state: RUNNING)\r\n```\r\nI confirmed that when the driver has not yet launched, the report does not include the two Driver Logs items. Will omit the output here for brevity since it looks the same.","created_at":"2020-10-19T23:40:47Z","updated_at":"2020-11-05T18:49:34Z","closed_at":"2020-11-05T18:40:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e1238af69ae0027b1656c70f4c7a4895b33422e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30096/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30096/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30096/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/42212a8c566776d92d9910e86aff2343055e6680","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-33185-yarn-client-print","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-33185-yarn-client-print","sha":"42212a8c566776d92d9910e86aff2343055e6680","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR aims to fix a correctness bug in the optimizer rule `EliminateSorts`. It also adds a new physical rule to remove redundant sorts that cannot be eliminated in the Optimizer rule after the bugfix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA global sort should not be eliminated even if its child is ordered since we don't know if its child ordering is global or local. For example, in the following scenario, the first sort shouldn't be removed because it has a stronger guarantee than the second sort even if the sort orders are the same for both sorts. \r\n\r\n```\r\nSort(orders, global = True, ...)\r\n  Sort(orders, global = False, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince there is no straightforward way to identify whether a node's output ordering is local or global, we should not remove a global sort even if its child is already ordered.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-19T18:30:24Z","updated_at":"2024-01-19T01:21:51Z","closed_at":"2020-10-28T05:52:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7c7a7ac24d3b0df31a04b7a78fd7b72a27b03e0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30093/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30093/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30093/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cdc7dbe1f69d2cec912c536d388eb68756107d61","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:fix-sort","ref":"fix-sort","sha":"cdc7dbe1f69d2cec912c536d388eb68756107d61","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to use `fail_if_no_tests` option at `action-surefire-report` plugin, see also https://github.com/ScaCap/action-surefire-report/issues/29.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29946 introduced the manual skipping in Apache Spark itself. After that, the plugin introduced the feature. Now, this PR reverts #29946 and enable that option.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo remove manual skipping and avoid maintenance cost.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI will push a commit to show in this PR because this change is specific to GitHub Actions:

supports both Java8/Java11, there is a difference.\r\n\r\n1. Java8-built distribution can run both Java8/Java11\r\n2. Java11-built distribution can run on Java11, but not Java8.\r\n\r\nIn short, we had better use Java11 in Dockerfile to embrace both cases without any issues.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.

IT.","created_at":"2020-10-18T06:31:25Z","updated_at":"2020-10-18T16:23:21Z","closed_at":"2020-10-18T16:21:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb266808085f0c4e6e331b418605cf00f9a27670","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/049c10dae1cdebd6ab3f23543eca1031965c49ac","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-33176","ref":"SPARK-33176","sha":"049c10dae1cdebd6ab3f23543eca1031965c49ac","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"3010e9044e068216d7a7a9ec510453ecbb159f95","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request changes the link to the pickle module page from https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html to https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html in RDD Programming Guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSince Python 2 is no longer supported and it is preferable to refer to the pickle module page of Python 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nBefore: the `Pickle` link's destination page was https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html\r\nAfter: the `Pickle` link's destination page is https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy building the documentation site and check the link's destination page is changed correctly in the local environment.","created_at":"2020-10-18T05:22:10Z","updated_at":"2020-10-18T08:41:39Z","closed_at":"2020-10-18T08:14:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"43511baf4fdbf96bb358030d37a43695ac4c6031","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30081/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30081/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30081/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0cc661e162a13b1b55551b8b13d016cdf86adca3","head":{"label":"kjmrknsn:docs-fix-pickle-link","ref":"docs-fix-pickle-link","sha":"0cc661e162a13b1b55551b8b13d016cdf86adca3","user":{"login":"kjmrknsn","id":31149688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQ5Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31149688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn","html_url":"https://github.com/kjmrknsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":304872097,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQ4NzIwOTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"kjmrknsn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kjmrknsn","id":31149688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQ5Njg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31149688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn","html_url":"https://github.com/kjmrknsn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kjmrknsn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kjmrknsn/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to migrate `DROP TABLE` to use `UnresolvedTableOrView` to resolve the table/view identifier. This allows consistent resolution rules (temp view first, etc.) to be applied for both v1/v2 commands. More info about the consistent resolution rule proposal can be found in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-29900) or [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvLjGA8y_W_hhilpngXVub1Ebv8RsMap986nENCFnrg/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current behavior is not consistent between v1 and v2 commands when resolving a temp view.\r\nIn v2, the `t` in the following example is resolved to a table:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE testcat.ns.t (id bigint) USING foo\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 2\")\r\nsql(\"USE testcat.ns\")\r\nsql(\"DROP TABLE t\") // 't' is resolved to testcat.ns.t\r\n```\r\nwhereas in v1, the `t` is resolved to a temp view:\r\n```scala\r\nsql(\"CREATE DATABASE test\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TABLE spark_catalog.test.t (id bigint) USING csv\")\r\nsql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW t AS SELECT 2\")\r\nsql(\"USE spark_catalog.test\")\r\nsql(\"DROP TABLE t\") // 't' is resolved to a temp view\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nAfter this PR, for v2, `DROP TABLE t` is resolved to a temp view `t` instead of `testcat.ns.t`, consistent with v1 behavior.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is backport of SPARK-26646 to branch-2.4 to fix flaky test in the branch.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe test pyspark.mllib.tests.StreamingLogisticRegressionWithSGDTests.test_training_and_prediction looks sometimes flaky.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/spark/spark/python/pyspark/mllib/tests.py\", line 1492, in test_training_and_prediction\r\n    self._eventually(condition, timeout=180.0)\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/spark/spark/python/pyspark/mllib/tests.py\", line 133, in _eventually\r\n    lastValue = condition()\r\n  File \"/home/runner/work/spark/spark/python/pyspark/mllib/tests.py\", line 1487, in condition\r\n    self.assertGreater(errors[1] - errors[-1], 0.3)\r\nAssertionError: -0.07000000000000006 not greater than 0.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe predict stream can possibly be consumed to the end before the input stream. When it happens, the model improvement is not high as expected and causes test failed. This patch tries to increase number of batches of streams. This won't increase test time because we have a timeout there.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCorrect the resolution of having clause.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nGrouping sets construct new aggregate lost the qualified name of grouping expression. Here is a example:\r\n```\r\n-- Works resolved by `ResolveReferences`\r\nselect c1 from values (1) as t1(c1) group by grouping sets(t1.c1) having c1 = 1\r\n\r\n-- Works because of the extra expression c1\r\nselect c1 as c2 from values (1) as t1(c1) group by grouping sets(t1.c1) having t1.c1 = 1\r\n\r\n-- Failed\r\nselect c1 from values (1) as t1(c1) group by grouping sets(t1.c1) having t1.c1 = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt wroks with `Aggregate` without grouping sets through `ResolveReferences`, but Grouping sets not works since the exprId has been changed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to support left semi join in stream-stream join. The implementation of left semi join is (mostly in `StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec` and `SymmetricHashJoinStateManager`):\r\n* For left side input row, check if there's a match on right side state store.\r\n  * if there's a match, output the left side row, but do not put the row in left side state store (no need to put in state store).\r\n  * if there's no match, output nothing, but put the row in left side state store (with \"matched\" field to set to false in state store).\r\n* For right side input row, check if there's a match on left side state store.\r\n  * For all matched left rows in state store, output the rows with \"matched\" field as false. Set all left rows with \"matched\" field to be true. Only output the left side rows matched for the first time to guarantee left semi join semantics.\r\n* State store eviction: evict rows from left/right side state store below watermark, same as inner join.\r\n\r\nNote a followup optimization can be to evict matched left side rows from state store earlier, even when the rows are still above watermark. However this needs more change in `SymmetricHashJoinStateManager`, so will leave this as a followup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrent stream-stream join supports inner, left outer and right outer join (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamingSymmetricHashJoinExec.scala#L166 ). We do see internally a lot of users are using left semi stream-stream join (not spark structured streaming), e.g. I want to get the ad impression (join left side) which has click (joint right side), but I don't care how many clicks per ad (left semi semantics).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests in `UnsupportedOperationChecker.scala` and

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCorrect the resolution of having clause.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nGrouping sets construct new aggregate lost the qualified name of grouping expression. Here is a example:\r\n```\r\n-- Works resolved by `ResolveReferences`\r\nselect c1 from values (1) as t1(c1) group by grouping sets(t1.c1) having c1 = 1\r\n\r\n-- Works because of the extra expression c1\r\nselect c1 as c2 from values (1) as t1(c1) group by grouping sets(t1.c1) having t1.c1 = 1\r\n\r\n-- Failed\r\nselect c1 from values (1) as t1(c1) group by grouping sets(t1.c1) having t1.c1 = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt wroks with `Aggregate` without grouping sets through `ResolveReferences`, but Grouping sets not works since the exprId has been changed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add a config we can control fast-fail behavior in FileFormatWriter and set it false by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn SPARK-29649, we catch `FileAlreadyExistsException` in `FileFormatWriter` and fail fast for the task set to prevent task retry.\r\n\r\nDue to latest discussion, it is important to be able to keep original behavior that is to retry tasks even `FileAlreadyExistsException` is thrown, because `FileAlreadyExistsException` could be recoverable in some cases.\r\n\r\nWe are going to add a config we can control this behavior and set it false for fast-fail by default.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. By default the task in FileFormatWriter will retry even if `FileAlreadyExistsException` is thrown. This is the behavior before Spark 3.0. User can control fast-fail behavior by enabling it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `eventually` to fix the flakiness of the test case `SPARK-33088: executor failed tasks trigger plugin calls`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe test case checks like the following.\r\n```scala\r\nassert(TestSparkPlugin.executorPlugin.numOnTaskStart == 2)\r\nassert(TestSparkPlugin.executorPlugin.numOnTaskSucceeded == 0)\r\nassert(TestSparkPlugin.executorPlugin.numOnTaskFailed == 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough first and second passed, the third can fail.\r\n-

this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis only improves the

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nHaving `CodeGenerator.getValueFromVector()` to correctly treat `UserDefniedType`s as `CodeGenerator.javaType()` does.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout it the generated java code would not compile, the error was \r\n```\r\nrg.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompileException: File 'generated.java', Line 153, Column 126: No applicable constructor/method found for actual parameters \"int, int\"; candidates are: \"public org.apache.spark.sql.vectorized.ColumnarRow

change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI've added a unit test to verify the proper code is generated:

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to remove `assert` from `Benchmark` for making it easier to run benchmark codes via `spark-submit`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSince the current `Benchmark` (`master` and `branch-3.0`) has `assert`, we need to pass the proper jars of `scalatest` and `scalactic`;\r\n - scalatest-core_2.12-3.2.0.jar\r\n - scalatest-compatible-3.2.0.jar\r\n - scalactic_2.12-3.0.jar\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit --jars scalatest-core_2.12-3.2.0.jar,scalatest-compatible-3.2.0.jar,scalactic_2.12-3.0.jar,./sql/catalyst/target/spark-catalyst_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar,./core/target/spark-core_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar --class org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.TPCDSQueryBenchmark ./sql/core/target/spark-sql_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar --data-location /tmp/tpcds-sf1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis update can make developers submit benchmark codes without these dependencies;\r\n```\r\n./bin/spark-submit --jars ./sql/catalyst/target/spark-catalyst_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar,./core/target/spark-core_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar --class org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.TPCDSQueryBenchmark ./sql/core/target/spark-sql_2.12-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar --data-location /tmp/tpcds-sf1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded a couple tests to `AvroSuite` and to `ParquetIOSuite` to check that the metadata key 'org.apache.spark.legacyDateTime' is written correctly depending on the SQL configs:\r\n- spark.sql.legacy.avro.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\r\n- spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28137.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To improve test coverage\r\n2. To make sure that the metadata key is actually saved to Avro/Parquet files\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the added tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.parquet.ParquetIOSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"avro/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.avro.AvroV1Suite\"\r\n$

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `pre-built image` at Github Action PySpark jobs. To isolate the changes, `pyspark` jobs are split from the main job. The docker image is built by the following.\r\n\r\n| Item                   | URL                |\r\n| --------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Dockerfile         | https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/ApacheSparkGitHubActionImage/blob/main/Dockerfile |\r\n| Builder               | https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/ApacheSparkGitHubActionImage/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml |\r\n| Image Location | https://hub.docker.com/r/dongjoon/apache-spark-github-action-image |\r\n\r\nPlease note that.\r\n1. The community still will use `build_and_test.yml` to add new features like as we did until now. The `Dockerfile` will be updated regularly.\r\n2. When Apache Spark gets an official docker repository location, we will use it.\r\n3. Also, it's the best if we keep this docker file and builder script at a new Apache Spark dev branch instead of outside GitHub repository.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, two `pyspark` test jobs take over one and half hour always. In total, 3 hours 14 minutes.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/runs/1240470628 (1 hour 35 mins)\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/runs/1240470634 (1 hour 39 mins)\r\n\r\nThis PR will remove the package installation steps which takes 16 minutes and causes flakiness. Note that `Python 3.6 package installation` is not included in the pre-built image and it only takes `20s`.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-10-15 at 10 32 17 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9700541/96165634-be625080-0ed1-11eb-974b-940c112152e9.png)\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-10-15 at 10 58 17 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9700541/96168262-5d3c7c00-0ed5-11eb-83c5-e9dc189a156b.png)\r\n\r\nIn short, `pyspark` GitHub jobs take shorter time. In total, 2 hours 23 minutes (<- 3 hours 14 minutes, previously).\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30059/checks?check_run_id=1260512568 (1 hour 18 mins)\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30059/checks?check_run_id=1260512582 (1 hour 5 mins)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the GitHub Action on this PR without `package installation

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add the `legacySizeOfNull ` parameter to the `Size` expression, and pass the value of `spark.sql.legacy.sizeOfNull` if `legacySizeOfNull` is not provided on creation of `Size`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis allows to avoid the issue when the configuration change between different phases of planning, and this can silently break a query plan which can lead to crashes or data corruption.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nBy

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, we verify path in `DataSourceAnalysis`\r\n```\r\n// For dynamic partition overwrite, we do not delete partition directories ahead.\r\n// We write to staging directories and move to final partition directories after writing\r\n// job is done. So it is ok to have outputPath try to overwrite inputpath.\r\n if (overwrite && !insertCommand.dynamicPartitionOverwrite) {\r\n      DDLUtils.verifyNotReadPath(actualQuery, outputPath)\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n   * Throws exception if outputPath tries to overwrite inputpath.\r\n   */\r\n  def verifyNotReadPath(query: LogicalPlan, outputPath: Path) : Unit = {\r\n    val inputPaths = query.collect {\r\n      case LogicalRelation(r: HadoopFsRelation, _, _, _) =>\r\n        r.location.rootPaths\r\n    }.flatten\r\n\r\n    if (inputPaths.contains(outputPath)) {\r\n      throw new AnalysisException(\r\n        \"Cannot overwrite a path that is also being read from.\")\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n``` \r\nFor partition table,  we can know that both `outputPath` and  collected `inputPaths` are table's , not partition's path.\r\nActually, when we overwrite table A's partition `a1` select from partition `a2`, then path won't conflict. But it compare both use table's path, then throw AnalysisException. \r\n\r\nSo we need to check this after Optimizer(got partition pushed down),  If we don't care about `dynamicPartitionFilter`, we can just add a check rule about this issue on SparkPlan using `FileSourceScanExec.selectedPartitions`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix bug\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUT","created_at":"2020-10-15T15:28:18Z","updated_at":"2023-04-06T05:27:30Z","closed_at":"2021-08-21T00:09:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d8a05839d02d3bc7eaf7fae59ee07c8ee8bd345","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30057/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30057/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30057/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/979e314d5645a6112992b97b935b1cfe61f12187","head":{"label":"AngersZhuuuu:SPARK-32838","ref":"SPARK-32838","sha":"979e314d5645a6112992b97b935b1cfe61f12187","user":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":176224753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYyMjQ3NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"AngersZhuuuu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AngersZhuuuu","id":46485123,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NDg1MTIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46485123?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu","html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AngersZhuuuu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AngersZhuuuu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite` to control timestamps rebasing in saving them as INT96. It supports the same set of values as `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite` but the default value is `LEGACY` to preserve backward compatibility with Spark <= 3.0.\r\n2. Write the metadata key `org.apache.spark.int96NoRebase` to parquet files if the files are saved with `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite` isn't set to `LEGACY`.\r\n3. Add the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInRead` to control loading INT96 timestamps when parquet metadata doesn't have enough info (the `org.apache.spark.int96NoRebase` tag) about parquet writer - either INT96 was written by Proleptic Gregorian system or some Julian one.\r\n4. Modified Vectorized and Parquet-mr Readers to support loading/saving INT96 timestamps w/o rebasing depending on SQL config and the metadata tag:\r\n    - **No rebasing** in testing when the SQL config `spark.test.forceNoRebase` is set to `true`\r\n    - **No rebasing** if parquet metadata contains the tag `org.apache.spark.int96NoRebase`. This is the case when parquet files are saved by Spark >= 3.1 with `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite` is set to `CORRECTED`, or saved by other systems with the tag `org.apache.spark.int96NoRebase`.\r\n    - **With rebasing** if parquet files saved by Spark (any versions) without the metadata tag `org.apache.spark.int96NoRebase`.\r\n    - Rebasing depend on the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInRead` if there are no metadata tags `org.apache.spark.version` and `org.apache.spark.int96NoRebase`.\r\n  \r\nNew SQL configs are added instead of re-using existing `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite` and `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead` because of:\r\n- To allow users have different modes for INT96 and for TIMESTAMP_MICROS (MILLIS). For example, users might want to save INT96 as LEGACY but TIMESTAMP_MICROS as CORRECTED.\r\n- To have different modes for INT96 and DATE in load (or in save).\r\n- To be backward compatible with Spark 2.4. For now, `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInWrite/Read` are set to `EXCEPTION` by default.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Parquet spec says that INT96 must be stored as Julian days (see https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/pull/49). This doesn't mean that a reader ( or a writer) is based on the Julian calendar. So, rebasing from Proleptic Gregorian to Julian calendar can be not needed.\r\n2. Rebasing from/to Julian calendar can loose information because dates in one calendar don't exist in another one. Like 1582-10-04..1582-10-15 exist in Proleptic Gregorian calendar but not in the hybrid calendar (Julian + Gregorian), and visa versa, Julian date 1000-02-29 doesn't exist in Proleptic Gregorian calendar. We should allow users to save timestamps without loosing such dates (rebasing shifts such dates to the next valid date).\r\n3. It would also make Spark compatible with other systems such as Impala and newer versions of Hive that write proleptic Gregorian based INT96 timestamps.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt can when `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.int96RebaseModeInWrite` is set non-default value `LEGACY`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added a test to check the metadata key `org.apache.spark.int96NoRebase`\r\n- By `ParquetIOSuite`","created_at":"2020-10-15T13:39:41Z","updated_at":"2020-12-11T20:28:44Z","closed_at":"2020-10-20T05:59:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d3a8780ca11a6e71e527fef815e3773c579e1b1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30056/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/30056/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/30056/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fab3a8690413f4bc13d2f61a28eb769faff76cef","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:parquet-rebase-int96","ref":"parquet-rebase-int96","sha":"fab3a8690413f4bc13d2f61a28eb769faff76cef","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes a conflict between `RewriteDistinctAggregates` and `DecimalAggregates`.\r\nIn some cases, `DecimalAggregates` will wrap the decimal column to `UnscaledValue` using\r\ndifferent rules for different aggregates.\r\n\r\nThis means, same distinct column with different aggregates will change to different distinct columns\r\nafter `DecimalAggregates`. For example:\r\n`avg(distinct decimal_col), sum(distinct decimal_col)` may change to\r\n`avg(distinct UnscaledValue(decimal_col)), sum(distinct decimal_col)`\r\n\r\nWe assume after `RewriteDistinctAggregates`, there will be at most one distinct column in aggregates,\r\nbut `DecimalAggregates` breaks this assumption. To fix this, we have to switch the order of these two\r\nrules.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor queries with multiple foldable distinct columns, since they will be eliminated during\r\nexecution, it's not mandatory to let `RewriteDistinctAggregates` handle this case. And\r\nin the current code, `RewriteDistinctAggregates` *dose* miss some \"aggregating with\r\nmultiple foldable distinct expressions\" cases.\r\nFor example: `select count(distinct 2), count(distinct 2, 3)` will be missed.\r\n\r\nBut in the planner, this will trigger an error that \"multiple distinct expressions\" are not allowed.\r\nAs the foldable distinct columns can be eliminated finally, we can allow this in the aggregation\r\nplanner check.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded test case\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Linhong Liu <linhong.liu@databricks.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Wenchen Fan <wenchen@databricks.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf a block is removed between discovery to transfer fo the block, we short circuit that block and remove it from the list to transfer and increment the transferred blocks. This is complicated since both RPC errors and local read errors may be reported with the same exception class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSlow shuffle refreshes could waste time when decommissioning has already finished. Decommissioning might avoid transferring some some blocks to an otherwise live host which is marked as \"full\" if a deleted block fails to transfer to that host.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit and integration

Then we use this conf as defaults for `RESET` Command.\r\n\r\n`SparkSession.clearActiveSession/clearDefaultSession` will make the shared state invisible and unsharable. They will be internal only soon (confirmed with Wenchen), so cases with them called will not be a problem.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.
