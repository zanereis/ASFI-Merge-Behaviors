version of #1491.\n\n**Original Description**\nNew version of #1373, but updated for the 4.7 branch with another fix that allows it to properly find expunged root volumes. This is a bug fix, which is why we target the 4.7 branch.\n\nOriginal pull request:\nFixes regarding usage event emission.\n\nUsageEventUtils was previously not checking deleted accounts, which meant that if an account was deleted that had some resources running on it, those resources would get destroyed without emitting any events.\n\nFurthermore, the VOLUME_DELETE event of ROOT volumes is the responsibility of the UserVmManager, which gets circumvented when expunging resources following the account deletion. Added a check to the AccountManager which catches the ROOT volumes that need to be deleted and emits events for them.\n\nTo test this: Create a new user. As that user, create and destroy an instance. This should cause the VM_CREATE, VM_START, VM_STOP, VM_DESTROY, VOLUME_CREATE, and VOLUME_DELETE events to be emitted. \nCreate a new instance as the same user. Log in as admin, and delete the user. The same set of events should be emitted, and there should be no duplicate DELETE events for the ROOT volume of the previous instance.\n","created_at":"2016-08-02T14:40:50Z","updated_at":"2016-10-24T09:11:04Z","closed_at":"2016-10-22T14:14:11Z","merged_at":"2016-10-22T14:14:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"d989c5d8be1e0b8dc0d25d0402ada4039a695dc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1624/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1624/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1624/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/d989c5d8be1e0b8dc0d25d0402ada4039a695dc8","head":{"label":"greenqloud:pr-volume-usage-events-fixes-4.8","ref":"pr-volume-usage-events-fixes-4.8","sha":"d989c5d8be1e0b8dc0d25d0402ada4039a695dc8","user":{"login":"greenqloud","id":228758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyODc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud","html_url":"https://github.com/greenqloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:4.8","ref":"4.8","sha":"a664e035bd8ddfe9c270cf15f8e904d25d0c4e02","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

version of #1450, opened against the 4.8 branch.\n\n**Original Description**\nThis pull request fixes a concurrency issue when disabling static NAT on a bunch of IPs simultaneously. Under the old behavior, executing multiple disable requests would result in invalid IP associations being sent to the virtual router. This commit changes the behavior to apply an IP association for only the IP being added/released, which means that it is impossible for the virtual router to receive invalid data.\n\nThis was tested against a virtual router running on KVM and VMware. It would be nice to have some input how this change could affect redundant routers and other static NAT providers.\n","created_at":"2016-08-02T14:33:32Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T10:03:55Z","closed_at":"2017-01-17T10:03:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60b687e22148e4dc0d9b587d3f4131452627d58f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1623/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1623/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1623/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/45585ef0724887a78be882465c48a05d7dd73728","head":{"label":"greenqloud:pr-static-nat-concurrency-fix-4.8","ref":"pr-static-nat-concurrency-fix-4.8","sha":"45585ef0724887a78be882465c48a05d7dd73728","user":{"login":"greenqloud","id":228758,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIyODc1OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/228758?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud","html_url":"https://github.com/greenqloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/greenqloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:4.8","ref":"4.8","sha":"7f051bd790610ca45e9266e792b644e2c8d4156a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

TICKET: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9438\n### Introduction\n\nFrom #1361 it was possible to configure NFS version for secondary storage mount. \nHowever, changing NFS version requires inserting an new detail on `image_store_details` table, with `name = 'nfs.version'` and `value = X` where X is desired NFS version, and then restarting management server for changes to take effect.\n\nOur improvement aims to make NFS version changeable from UI, instead of previously described workflow.\n### Proposed solution\n\nBasically, NFS version is defined as an image store ConfigKey, this implied:\n- Adding a new Config scope: **ImageStore**\n- Make `ImageStoreDetailsDao` class to extend `ResourceDetailsDaoBase` and `ImageStoreDetailVO` implement `ResourceDetail`\n- Insert `'display'` column on `image_store_details` table\n- Extending `ListCfgsCmd` and `UpdateCfgCmd` to support **ImageStore** scope, which implied:\n  *\\* Injecting `ImageStoreDetailsDao` and `ImageStoreDao` on `ConfigurationManagerImpl` class, on `cloud-server` module.\n### Important\n\nIt is important to mention that `ImageStoreDaoImpl` and `ImageStoreDetailsDaoImpl` classes were moved from `cloud-engine-storage` to `cloud-engine-schema` module in order to Spring find those beans to inject on `ConfigurationManagerImpl` in `cloud-server` module.\n\nWe had this maven dependencies between modules:\n- `cloud-server --> cloud-engine-schema`\n- `cloud-engine-storage --> cloud-secondary-storage --> cloud-server`\n\nAs `ImageStoreDaoImpl` and `ImageStoreDetailsDao` were defined in `cloud-engine-storage`, and they needed in `cloud-server` module, to be injected on `ConfigurationManagerImpl`, if we added dependency from `cloud-server` to `cloud-engine-storage` we would introduce a dependency cycle. To avoid this cycle, we moved those classes to `cloud-engine-schema` module\n","created_at":"2016-07-22T15:08:00Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T22:21:34Z","closed_at":"2016-10-27T06:20:22Z","merged_at":"2016-10-27T06:20:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e77496601ab5420723ce8b955b3960faaba7d5c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/2e77496601ab5420723ce8b955b3960faaba7d5c","head":{"label":"nvazquez:nfsConfigKey","ref":"nfsConfigKey","sha":"2e77496601ab5420723ce8b955b3960faaba7d5c","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40547252,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDU0NzI1Mg==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"nvazquez/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

TICKET: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9428\n### Introduction\n\nOn #1310 passing vRAM size to support 3D GPU problem was addressed on VMware. It was found out that it could be improved to increase performance by reducing extra API calls, as we'll describe later\n### Improvement\n\nOn WMware, `VmwareResource` manages execution of `StartCommand.` Before sending power on command to ESXi hypervisor, vm is configured by calling `reconfigVMTask` web method on vSphere's client `VimPortType` web service.\nIt was found out that we were using this method 2 times when passing vRAM size, as it implied creating a new vm config spec only editing video card specs and making an extra call to `reconfigVMTask.`\n\nWe propose reducing the extra web service call by adjusting vm's config spec. This way video card gets properly configured (when passing vRAM size) in the same configure call, increasing performance.\n### Use case (passing vRAM size)\n- Deploy a new VM, let its id be X\n- Stop VM\n- Execute SQL, where X is vm's id and Z is vRAM size (in kB): \n\n```\nINSERT INTO cloud.user_vm_details (vm_id, name, value) VALUES (X, 'mks.enable3d', 'true');\nINSERT INTO cloud.user_vm_details (vm_id, name, value) VALUES (X, 'mks.use3dRenderer', 'automatic');\nINSERT INTO cloud.user_vm_details (vm_id, name, value) VALUES (X, 'svga.autodetect', 'false');\nINSERT INTO cloud.user_vm_details (vm_id, name, value) VALUES (X, 'svga.vramSize', Z);\n```\n- Start

Introduction\n\nFor VMware, It is possible to decide creating VMs as full clones on ESX HV, adjusting `vmware.create.full.clone` global setting. We would like to introduce this property as a primary storage detail, and use its value instead of global setting's value.\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe propose introducing `fullCloneFlag` on `PrimaryDataStoreTO` sent on `CopyCommand`. This way we can reconfigure `VmwareStorageProcessor` and `VmwareStorageSubsystemCommandHandler` similar as it was done for `nfsVersion` but refactoring it to be more general.\n","created_at":"2016-07-01T15:08:38Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T13:22:48Z","closed_at":"2016-09-21T11:12:19Z","merged_at":"2016-09-21T11:12:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb275a5ad161f0ee1d2930e8fc4708caf529bc4b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/bb275a5ad161f0ee1d2930e8fc4708caf529bc4b","head":{"label":"nvazquez:clonegranular","ref":"clonegranular","sha":"bb275a5ad161f0ee1d2930e8fc4708caf529bc4b","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40547252,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDU0NzI1Mg==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"nvazquez/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

PR adds an ability to Pass a new parameter, locationType,\nto the “createSnapshot” API command. Depending on the locationType,\nwe decide where the snapshot should go in case of managed storage.\n\nThere are two possible values for the locationType param\n\n1) `Primary`: The standard operation for managed storage is to\nkeep the snapshot on the device (primary). For non-managed storage, this will\ngive an error as this option is only supported for managed storage\n\n2) `Secondary`: Applicable only to managed storage. This will\nkeep the snapshot on the secondary storage. For non-managed\nstorage, this will result in an error.\n\nThe reason for implementing this feature is to avoid a single\npoint of failure for primary storage. Right now in case of managed\nstorage, if the primary storage goes down, there is no easy way\nto recover data as all snapshots are also stored on the primary.\nThis features allows us to mitigate that

TICKET: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9407\n### Introduction\n\nIt was found out that in production environments `vm_network_map` table entries were slowly growing. It was investigated how this entries were cleaned up.\n### Behaviour\n\nOn vm creation, vm mappings are inserted on `vm_network_map`.\nOn vm stop, mappings are deleted from `vm_network_map` for vm, as a result of the release of its nics.\n### Problem\n\nIf created vm is stopped from hypervisor side (at least on vSphere in which we tested it), when CloudStack realizes vm is stopped it doesn't clean up `vm_network_table,` and, as cleanup is made during vm stop, when vm is eventually destroyed and expunged it won't clean up their entries in that table.\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe propose to move `vm_network_map` table cleanup to expunge command instead of stop command.\n","created_at":"2016-06-16T17:40:20Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T13:24:37Z","closed_at":"2016-07-19T12:19:26Z","merged_at":"2016-07-19T12:19:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"c754a0cf304aa2e40d0747543c023983f201540c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1594/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1594/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1594/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/c754a0cf304aa2e40d0747543c023983f201540c","head":{"label":"nvazquez:vmnetworkmapissue","ref":"vmnetworkmapissue","sha":"c754a0cf304aa2e40d0747543c023983f201540c","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40547252,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDU0NzI1Mg==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"nvazquez/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

is first phase of support of Shared Network in cloudstack through NuageVsp Network Plugin. A shared network is a type of virtual network that is shared between multiple accounts i.e. a shared network can be accessed by virtual machines that belong to many different accounts. This basic functionality will be supported with the below common use case:\n- shared network can be used for monitoring purposes. A shared network can be assigned to a domain and can be used for monitoring VMs belonging to all accounts in that domain.\n\nWith the current implementation with NuageVsp plugin, Each shared network needs its unique IP address range, and can not overlap with another shared network. \nIn VSD, it is implemented in below manner:\n- In order to have tenant isolation for shared networks, we will have to create a Shared L3 Subnet for each shared network, and instantiate it across the relevant enterprises. A shared network will only exist under an enterprise when it is needed, so when the first VM is spinned under that ACS domain inside that shared network.\n\nPR contents:\n1) Support for shared

digged deeper, and found out that Tomcat is really specific in how it loads the JDBC drivers apparently.\nIf we would be using the standard JDBC connection pooling of Tomcat (tomcat-jdbc) instead of commons-dbcp, we would have the option to specify a \"driverClassName\" when creating our connection.\nThis is not the case for commons-dbcp, which we are using within ACS.\n\nIf you check an official example of Tomcat : \nhttps://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html#Plain_Ol'_Java \nor\nhttps://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/jdbc-pool.html#As_a_Resource\n\nAs you can see in the above examples, both of them specify the driverClassName.\nIn the underlying implementation of Tomcat, Tomcat will do `Class.forName(driverClassName)` which will trigger the auto-registration of the Driver.\n\nTomcat code :\n\n``` java\n            if (driver==null) {\n                if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {\n                    log.debug(\"Instantiating driver using class: \"+poolProperties.getDriverClassName()+\" [url=\"+poolProperties.getUrl()+\"]\");\n                }\n                driver = (java.sql.Driver) Class.forName(poolProperties.getDriverClassName(),\n                                                         true, PooledConnection.class.getClassLoader()\n                                                         ).newInstance();\n

TICKET: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9386\n### Introduction\n\nIn some production environments with multiple clusters it was noticed that unused templates were consuming too much storage. It was discovered that template cleanup was not deleting marked templates on ESXi.\n### Description of the problem\n\nSuppose we have multiple clusters `(c1, c2,...,cN)` on a data center and template `T` from which we deploy vms on `c1.`\nSuppose now that we expunge those vms, and there's no other vm instance from template `T,` so this was the actual workflow:\n1. CloudStack marks template for cleanup after `storage.cleanup.interval` seconds, by setting `marked_for_gc = 1` on `template_spool_ref` table, for that template.\n2. After another `storage.cleanup.interval` seconds a `DestroyCommand` will be sent, to delete template from primary storage\n3. On `VmwareResource`, command is processed, and it first picks up a random cluster, say `ci != c1` to look for vm template (using volume's path) and destroy it. But, as template was on `c1` it cannot be found, so it won't be deleted. Entry on `template_spool_ref` is deleted but not the actual template on hypervisor side.\n### Proposed solution\n\nWe propose a way to attack problem shown in point 3, by not picking up a random cluster to look for vm but using vSphere data center. This way we make sure vm template will be deleted in every case, and not depending on random cluster selection\n","created_at":"2016-05-24T19:34:45Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T13:58:40Z","closed_at":"2016-09-13T09:45:30Z","merged_at":"2016-09-13T09:45:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"1384d748a7296019f0d8ba2a5fcf4b97090f2e04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1560/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1560/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1560/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/1384d748a7296019f0d8ba2a5fcf4b97090f2e04","head":{"label":"nvazquez:gcbug","ref":"gcbug","sha":"1384d748a7296019f0d8ba2a5fcf4b97090f2e04","user":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":40547252,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDU0NzI1Mg==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"nvazquez/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nvazquez","id":5295080,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyOTUwODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5295080?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez","html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvazquez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nvazquez/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

interface was removed (\"BareMetalVmService\").\r\n# Detailed work\r\n\r\nChanges at the interface \"com.cloud.vm.UserVmManager\":\r\n- removed method \"com.cloud.vm.UserVmManager.getVirtualMachines(long)\"\r\n  that is not used at the class that implements this interface;\r\n- removed method \"com.cloud.vm.UserVmManager.stopVirtualMachine(long,\r\n  long)\" as it is not used at the \"UserVmManagerImpl\" class;\r\n\r\nChanges at the class \"com.cloud.vm.UserVmManagerImpl\":\r\n- \"com.cloud.vm.UserVmManagerImpl.UserVmCloneType\" enum access

to the mailing thread titled \"MySQL : No suitable driver found for jdbc:mysql\".\nIt doesn't harm that we explicitely load the MySQL driver, and for those which would use a commons-dbcp version < 1.4 this would fix it as well. Since JDBC 4.0, the JDBC driver can auto-register itself, but for some weird cases (like ours), it's not working. Therefore we need to explicitly load the JDBC driver.\n","created_at":"2016-05-20T08:30:15Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:04Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:04Z","merged_at":"2016-05-26T03:06:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"02c5d44f0b431ea1902ec1aed7167e932930d3b3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/02c5d44f0b431ea1902ec1aed7167e932930d3b3","head":{"label":"nlivens:mysql_driver_issue","ref":"mysql_driver_issue","sha":"02c5d44f0b431ea1902ec1aed7167e932930d3b3","user":{"login":"nlivens","id":3336539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens","html_url":"https://github.com/nlivens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41410234,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTQxMDIzNA==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"nlivens/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nlivens","id":3336539,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzY1Mzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3336539?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens","html_url":"https://github.com/nlivens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nlivens/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nlivens/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

commit adds a additional VirtIO channel with the name\n'org.qemu.guest_agent.0' to all Instances.\n\nWith the Qemu Guest Agent the Hypervisor gains more control over the Instance if\nthese tools are present inside the Instance, for example:\n- Power control\n- Flushing filesystems\n- Fetching Network information\n\nIn the future this should allow safer snapshots on KVM since we can instruct the\nInstance to flush the filesystems prior to snapshotting the disk.\n\nMore information: http://wiki.qemu.org/Features/QAPI/GuestAgent\n\nKeep in mind that on Ubuntu AppArmor still needs to be disabled since the default\nAppArmor profile doesn't allow libvirt to write into /var/lib/libvirt/qemu\n\nThis commit does not add any communication methods through API-calls, it merely\nadds the channel to the Instances and installs the Guest Agent in the SSVMs.\n","created_at":"2016-05-13T09:41:10Z","updated_at":"2016-11-24T17:43:14Z","closed_at":"2016-11-24T17:43:14Z","merged_at":"2016-11-24T17:43:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"2a5f37c1b10ba4e5acaf7fbb30ce0b016b04d082","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1545/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/1545/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/1545/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/2a5f37c1b10ba4e5acaf7fbb30ce0b016b04d082","head":{"label":"wido:qemu-guest-agent","ref":"qemu-guest-agent","sha":"2a5f37c1b10ba4e5acaf7fbb30ce0b016b04d082","user":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39056651,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTA1NjY1MQ==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"wido/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wido","id":326786,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc4Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/326786?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido","html_url":"https://github.com/wido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wido/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

Introduction\n\n[JIRA TICKET](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-9379)\n\nIt is desired to support nested virtualization at VM level for VMware hypervisor. Current behaviour supports enabling/desabling global nested virtualization by modifying global config `'vmware.nested.virtualization'`. It is wished to improve this feature, having control at VM level instead of a global control only.\n## Proposal\n\nA new global configuration is added, to enable/disable VM nested virtualization control: `'vmware.nested.virtualization.perVM'`. Default value=false\n## Behaviour\n\nAfter a vm deployment or start command, vm params include `'nestedVirtualizationFlag'` key and its value is:\n- true -> nested virtualization enabled\n- false -> nested virtualization disabled\n\n**We will determinate nested virtualization enabled/disabled by examining this 3 values:**\n- **(1)** global configuration `'vmware.nested.virtualization'` value\n- **(2)** global configuration `'vmware.nested.virtualization.perVM'` value\n- **(3)** `'nestedVirtualizationFlag'` value in `user_vm_details` if present, `null` if not.\n\nUsing this 3 values, there are different use cases:\n- **(1)** = TRUE, **(2)** = TRUE, **(3)** is null -> _ENABLED_\n- **(1)** = TRUE, **(2)** = TRUE, **(3)** = TRUE -> _ENABLED_\n- **(1)** = TRUE, **(2)** = TRUE, **(3)** = FALSE -> _DISABLED_\n- **(1)** = TRUE, **(2)** = FALSE, **(3)** indifferent  -> _ENABLED_\n- **(1)** = FALSE, **(2)** = TRUE, **(3)** is null -> _DISABLED_\n- **(1)** = FALSE, **(2)** = TRUE, **(3)** = TRUE -> _ENABLED_\n- **(1)** = FALSE, **(2)** = TRUE, **(3)** = FALSE -> _DISABLED_\n- **(1)** = FALSE, **(2)** = FALSE, **(3)** indifferent ->
