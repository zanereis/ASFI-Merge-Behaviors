What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark on Kubernetes creates some auxiliary Kubernetes resources such as the headless driver service used by the executors to connect to the driver and the ConfigMap that carries configuration for the init-container. Such resources are no longer needed once an application completes, but they are still persisted by the API server and there should be deleted upon completion. This PR handles the cases when the submission waits for the application to complete, which is the default behavior as `spark.kubernetes.submission.waitAppCompletion` defaults to `true`. \r\n\r\nXref:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn order to optimize queries, some conditions can be added to the join condition for LEFT ANTI and OUTER joins. Unfortunately, so far this was not done since we are using only constraints which can be enforced on the output of the operator (in this case of the JOIN).\r\n\r\nWe can enforce some `isNotNull` conditions on one side, which are not valid conditions on the output of the Join, though. The PR adds these conditions in the `Optimizer` phase, in order to improve performance in some cases.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UTs\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn a kerberized cluster, when Spark reads a file path (e.g. `people.json`), it warns with a wrong warning message during looking up `people.json/_spark_metadata`. The root cause of this situation is the difference between `LocalFileSystem` and `DistributedFileSystem`. `LocalFileSystem.exists()` returns `false`, but `DistributedFileSystem.exists` raises `org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn a kerberized cluster, when Spark reads a file path (e.g. `people.json`), it warns with a wrong warning message during looking up `people.json/_spark_metadata`. The root cause of this situation is the difference between `LocalFileSystem` and `DistributedFileSystem`. `LocalFileSystem.exists()` returns `false`, but `DistributedFileSystem.exists` raises `org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException`.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd an epoch ID argument to DataWriterFactory for use in streaming. As a side effect of passing in this value, DataWriter will now have a consistent lifecycle; commit() or abort() ends the lifecycle of a DataWriter instance in any execution mode.\r\n\r\nI considered making a separate streaming interface and adding the epoch ID only to that one, but I think it requires a lot of extra work for no real gain. I think it makes sense to define epoch 0 as the one and only epoch of a non-streaming query.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse property `spark.streaming.kafka.consumer.cache.enabled` in structured streaming introduced [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/18234) that allows users to enable or disable the cache for Kafka consumers. This property can be especially handy in cases where issues like [SPARK-19185](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19185) get hit, for which there isn't a solution committed yet. By default, the cache is still on, so this change doesn't change any out-of-box behavior. The structured streaming problem reported in [SPARK-23526](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-23526).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAutomated: Passed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when the Kafka source reads from Kafka, it generates as many tasks as the number of partitions in the topic(s) to be read. In some case, it may be beneficial to read the data with greater parallelism, that is, with more number partitions/tasks. That means, offset ranges must be divided up into smaller ranges such the number of records in partition ~= total records in batch / desired partitions. This would also balance out any data skews between topic-partitions.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, I have added a new option called `minPartitions`, which allows the user to specify the desired level of parallelism.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests in

resource-managers/kubernetes/integration-tests\r\n* Add a reference to these tests in the root README.md\r\n* Fix a path reference in dev/dev-run-integration-tests.sh\r\n* Add a TODO in include/util.sh\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIncorporation of Kubernetes integration tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis code has its own unit tests, but the main purpose is to provide the integration tests.\r\nI tested this on my laptop by running dev/dev-run-integration-tests.sh --spark-tgz ~/spark-2.4.0-SNAPSHOT-bin--.tgz\r\n\r\nThe spark-integration tests have already been running for months in AMPLab, here is an example:\r\nhttps://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/testing-k8s-scheduled-spark-integration-master/\r\n\r\nPlease

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe from_json() function accepts an additional parameter, where the user might specify the schema. The issue is that the specified schema might not be compatible with data. In particular, the JSON data might be missing data for fields declared as non-nullable in the schema. The from_json() function does not verify the data against such errors. When data with missing fields is sent to the parquet encoder, there is no verification either. The end results is a corrupt parquet file.\r\n\r\nTo avoid corruptions, make sure that all fields in the user-specified schema are set to be nullable.\r\nSince this changes the behavior of a public function, we need to include it in release notes.\r\nThe behavior can be reverted by setting `spark.sql.fromJsonForceNullableSchema=false`\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded two new tests.","created_at":"2018-02-28T12:50:39Z","updated_at":"2018-03-09T22:33:02Z","closed_at":"2018-03-09T22:33:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1421dd3acc9008c042ae58670abddaa44f8c171d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20694/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20694/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20694/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5aec68d1d0d97bdeaec4fbaca27d4db8618654b5","head":{"label":"mswit-databricks:SPARK-23173","ref":"SPARK-23173","sha":"5aec68d1d0d97bdeaec4fbaca27d4db8618654b5","user":{"login":"mswit-databricks","id":29868305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODY4MzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29868305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks","html_url":"https://github.com/mswit-databricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123270454,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMyNzA0NTQ=","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"mswit-databricks/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mswit-databricks","id":29868305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5ODY4MzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29868305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks","html_url":"https://github.com/mswit-databricks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mswit-databricks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mswit-databricks/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn this PR we've done two things:\r\n1) updated the Spark's copy of cloudpickle to 0.6.1 (current stable)\r\nThe main reason Spark stayed with cloudpickle 0.4.x was that the default pickle protocol was changed in later versions.\r\n\r\n2) started using pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL for both Python 2 and Python 3 for serializers and broadcast\r\n[Pyrolite](https://github.com/irmen/Pyrolite) has such Pickle protocol version support: reading: 0,1,2,3,4; writing: 2.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nAuthors: Sloane Simmons, Boris Shminke\r\n\r\nThis contribution is original work of Sloane Simmons and Boris Shminke and they licensed it to the project under the project's open source

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently Spark on Yarn supports better data locality by considering the preferred locations of the pending tasks when dynamic allocation is enabled, refer to _https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-4352_.\r\nMesos also supports data locality, refer to _https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16944_\r\n\r\nIt would be better that Standalone can also support this feature.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n1.Added a unit test.\r\n2.Manual testing on HDFS in my environment.\r\nEnvironment description: 5 workers, 3 HDFS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes for `pyspark.util._exception_message` to produce the trace from Java side by `Py4JJavaError`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, in Python 2, it uses `message` attribute which `Py4JJavaError` didn't happen to have:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.util import _exception_message\r\n>>> try:\r\n...     sc._jvm.java.lang.String(None)\r\n... except Exception as e:\r\n...     pass\r\n...\r\n>>> e.message\r\n''\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems we should use `str` instead for now:\r\n\r\n https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/blob/aa6c53b59027925a426eb09b58c453de02c21b7c/py4j-python/src/py4j/protocol.py#L412\r\n\r\nbut this doesn't address the problem with non-ascii string from Java side -\r\n `https://github.com/bartdag/py4j/issues/306`\r\n\r\nSo, we could directly call `__str__()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> e.__str__()\r\nu'An error occurred while calling None.java.lang.String.\\n: java.lang.NullPointerException\\n\\tat java.lang.String.<init>(String.java:588)\\n\\tat sun.reflect.NativeConstructorAccessorImpl.newInstance0(Native Method)\\n\\tat

py4j.GatewayConnection.run(GatewayConnection.java:214)\\n\\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich doesn't type coerce unicodes to `str` in Python 2.\r\n\r\nThis can be actually a problem:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\r\nspark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled\", True)\r\nspark.range(1).select(udf(lambda x: [[]])()).toPandas()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/.../spark/python/pyspark/sql/dataframe.py\", line

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nA few places in `spark-sql` were using `sc.hadoopConfiguration` directly. They should be using `sessionState.newHadoopConf()` to blend in configs that were set through `SQLConf`.\n\nAlso, for better UX, for these configs blended in from `SQLConf`, we should consider removing the `spark.hadoop` prefix, so that the settings are recognized whether or not they were specified by the user.\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested that AlterTableRecoverPartitions now correctly recognizes settings that are passed in to the FileSystem through

Point 12:21 for owl can't have 12:19 processing time. Consequently new watermark should be computed on another data (12:15, cat). Donkey still will be rejected I suppose but I'm not sure whether those watermarks inclusive or exclusive. If watermark is set to 12:05 then I guess intermediate state for window 11:55(inclusive)-12:05(exclusive) could be cleared and there is no place for Donkey anymore. You need to change image and depending on how you will change it you need to adjust the text.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests for docs.\r\n\r\nPlease review

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHere we want to reimplement the task level retry for continuous processing, changes include:\r\n1. Add a new `EpochCoordinatorMessage` named `GetLastEpochAndOffset`, it is used for getting last epoch and offset of particular partition while task restarted.\r\n2. Add function setOffset for `ContinuousDataReader`, it supported BaseReader can restart from given offset.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd new UT in `ContinuousSuite` and new `StreamAction` named `CheckAnswerRowsContainsOnlyOnce` for more accurate result checking.","created_at":"2018-02-26T07:33:15Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T03:26:01Z","closed_at":"2018-11-05T03:26:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee7d5173aab6fe9909e616ded7fb5a298d656c0e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20675/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20675/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20675/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/21f574e2a3ad3c8e68b92776d2a141d7fcb90502","head":{"label":"xuanyuanking:SPARK-23033","ref":"SPARK-23033","sha":"21f574e2a3ad3c8e68b92776d2a141d7fcb90502","user":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52511431,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjUxMTQzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"xuanyuanking/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuanyuanking","id":4833765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4MzM3NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4833765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking","html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuanyuanking/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuanyuanking/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n(Please fill in changes proposed in this fix)\r\nI run a sql: `select ls.cs_order_number from ls left semi join catalog_sales cs on ls.cs_order_number = cs.cs_order_number`, The `ls` table is a small table ,and the number is one. The `catalog_sales` table is a big table,  and the number is 10 billion. The task will be hang up. And i find the many null values of `cs_order_number` in the `catalog_sales` table.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe algorithm in `DefaultPartitionCoalescer.setupGroups` is responsible for picking preferred locations for coalesced partitions. It analyzes the preferred locations of input partitions. It starts by trying to create one partition for each unique location in the input. However, if the the requested number of coalesced partitions is higher that the number of unique locations, it has to pick duplicate locations.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the duplicate locations would be picked by iterating over the input partitions in order, and copying their preferred locations to coalesced partitions. If the input partitions were clustered by location, this could result in severe skew.\r\n\r\nWith the fix, instead of iterating over the list of input partitions in order, we pick them at random. It's not perfectly balanced, but it's much better.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test reproducing the behavior was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs noted in SPARK-23488, the Python Catalog API was missing some methods that are present in the Scala API. Both for the sake of consistency, and because of their utility, I've added the missing methods (the database/table/functionExists() and getDatabase/Table/Function() methods).\r\n\r\nI modeled these methods off of how the existing ones were written in catalog.py.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmanually tested the added methods and compared functionality to the scala API counterparts\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure whether to set the `@since(x.y)` decorators on the new functions, and if so, what value to set them to?\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-22T05:28:47Z","updated_at":"2019-09-17T00:21:07Z","closed_at":"2019-09-17T00:21:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0bb8a60aa9e5b405269ef348a53afd0db713c46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406590181,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTkwMTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYSPARK","name":"PYSPARK","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c18e6b51ab649191a48694197007d8994939f401","head":{"label":"drboyer:add-other-catalog-methods","ref":"add-other-catalog-methods","sha":"c18e6b51ab649191a48694197007d8994939f401","user":{"login":"drboyer","id":4665492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjU0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4665492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer","html_url":"https://github.com/drboyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":120978853,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjA5Nzg4NTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"drboyer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"drboyer","id":4665492,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2NjU0OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4665492?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer","html_url":"https://github.com/drboyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/drboyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/drboyer/spark","description":"Mirror

the Spark AM relies on the initial set of tokens created by\r\nthe submission client to be able to talk to HDFS and other services that\r\nrequire delegation tokens. This means that after those tokens expire, a\r\nnew AM will fail to start (e.g. when there is an application failure and\r\nre-attempts are enabled).\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it so that the first thing the AM does when the user provides\r\na principal and keytab is to create new delegation tokens for use. This\r\nmakes sure that the AM can be started irrespective of how old the original\r\ntoken set is. It also allows all of the token management to be done by the\r\nAM - there is no need for the submission client to set configuration values\r\nto tell the AM when to renew tokens.\r\n\r\nNote that even though in this case the AM will not be using the delegation\r\ntokens created by the submission client, those tokens still need to be provided\r\nto YARN, since they are used to do log aggregation.\r\n\r\nTo be able to re-use the code in the AMCredentialRenewal for the above\r\npurposes, I refactored that class a bit so that it can fetch tokens into\r\na pre-defined UGI, insted of always logging in.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with re-attempts is that, after the fix that allows the AM\r\nto restart correctly, new executors would get confused about when to\r\nupdate credentials, because the credential updater used the update time\r\ninitially set up by the submission code. This could make the executor\r\nfail to update credentials in time, since that value would be very out\r\nof date in the situation described in the bug.\r\n\r\nTo fix that, I changed the YARN code to use the new RPC-based mechanism\r\nfor distributing tokens to executors. This allowed the old credential\r\nupdater code to be removed, and a lot of code in the renewer to be\r\nsimplified.\r\n\r\nI also made two currently hardcoded values (the renewal time ratio, and\r\nthe retry wait) configurable; while this probably never needs to be set\r\nby anyone in a production environment, it helps with testing; that's also\r\nwhy they're not documented.\r\n\r\nTested on real cluster with a specially crafted application to test this\r\nfunctionality: checked proper access to HDFS, Hive and HBase in cluster\r\nmode with token renewal on and AM restarts. Tested things still work in\r\nclient mode too.","created_at":"2018-02-22T02:20:32Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T21:02:57Z","closed_at":"2018-03-23T06:03:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9d28a837dc9d3531daffd38858a03f98307143b0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ab60dda1feb5c68f9ce6e67e14b777dd657e99a7","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-23361","ref":"SPARK-23361","sha":"ab60dda1feb5c68f9ce6e67e14b777dd657e99a7","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

Use this link - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20650/files?w=1**\r\n \r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe stream-stream join tests add data to multiple sources and expect it all to show up in the next batch. But there's a race condition; the new batch might trigger when only one of the AddData actions has been reached.\r\n\r\nPrior attempt to solve this issue by @jose-torres in #20646 attempted to simultaneously synchronize on all memory sources together when consecutive AddData was found in the actions. However, this carries the risk of deadlock as well as unintended modification of stress tests (see the above PR for a detailed explanation). Instead, this PR attempts the following.\r\n\r\n- A new action called `StreamProgressBlockedActions` that allows multiple actions to be executed while the streaming query is blocked from making progress. This allows data to be added to multiple sources that are made visible simultaneously in the next batch.\r\n- An alias of `StreamProgressBlockedActions` called `MultiAddData` is explicitly used in the `Streaming*JoinSuites` to add data to two memory sources simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis should avoid unintentional modification of the stress tests (or any other test for that matter) while making sure that the flaky tests are deterministic.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nModified test cases in `Streaming*JoinSuites` where there are consecutive `AddData`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe stream-stream join tests add data to multiple sources, and expect it all to show up in the next batch. But there's a race condition; the new batch might trigger when only one of the AddData actions has been reached.\r\n\r\nFortunately, MemoryStream synchronizes batch generation on itself, and StreamExecution won't generate empty batches. So we can resolve this race condition by synchronizing successive AddDataMemory actions against every MemoryStream together. Then we can be sure StreamExecution won't start generating a batch before all the data is present.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis adds two new config properties: spark.driver.defaultJavaOptions and spark.executor.defaultJavaOptions. These are intended to be set by administrators in a file of defaults for options like JVM garbage collection algorithm. Users will still set `extraJavaOptions` properties, and both sets of JVM options will be added to start a JVM. Otherwise, it is difficult for administrators to add properties that are not clobbered when users change their JVM options.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe have had this deployed to production for several weeks. If there is a place to add command-line options tests, please let me know and I'll add them.","created_at":"2018-02-20T22:17:36Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T12:50:39Z","closed_at":"2018-12-10T22:55:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37d4c22ff8e7f760191b2f0194f6cd0528040755","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20645/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20645/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20645/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/89ee1f330047c6c8a986e62e8201d9b7890cf4c8","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-23476-add-default-jvm-options","ref":"SPARK-23476-add-default-jvm-options","sha":"89ee1f330047c6c8a986e62e8201d9b7890cf4c8","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis updates the Mesos scheduler to integrate with the common logic for node-blacklisting across all cluster managers in BlacklistTracker. Specifically, it removes a hardcoded MAX_SLAVE_FAILURES = 2 in MesosCoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend, and uses the blacklist from the BlacklistTracker, as Yarn does.\r\n\r\nThis closes

to avoid the 170 minutes of scala tests that occurs each time one wants to add a jar to the assembly directory.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- clone branch\r\n- run build/sbt package\r\n- run python/run-tests --modules \"pyspark-streaming\" , expect error message\r\n- follow instructions in error message. i.e., run build/sbt assembly/package

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR backports [#20244](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20244) \r\n\r\nWhen we run concurrent jobs using the same rdd which is marked to do checkpoint. If one job has finished running the job, and start the process of RDD.doCheckpoint, while another job is submitted, then submitStage and submitMissingTasks will be called. In [submitMissingTasks](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/DAGScheduler.scala#L932), will serialize taskBinaryBytes and calculate task partitions which are both affected by the status of checkpoint, if the former is calculated before doCheckpoint finished, while the latter is calculated after doCheckpoint finished, when run task, rdd.compute will be called, for some rdds with particular partition type such as [UnionRDD](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.1/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/UnionRDD.scala) who will do partition type cast, will get a ClassCastException because the part params is actually a CheckpointRDDPartition.\r\nThis error occurs  because rdd.doCheckpoint occurs in the same thread that called sc.runJob, while the task serialization occurs in the DAGSchedulers event loop.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nthe exist

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe save ML's user-supplied params and default params as one entity in metadata. During loading the saved models, we set all the loaded params into created ML model instances as user-supplied params.\r\n\r\nIt causes some problems, e.g., if we strictly disallow some params to be set at the same time, a default param can fail the param check because it is treated as user-supplied param after loading.\r\n\r\nThe loaded default params should not be set as user-supplied params. We should save ML default params separately in metadata.\r\n\r\nFor backward compatibility, when loading metadata, if it is a metadata file from previous Spark, we shouldn't raise error if we can't
