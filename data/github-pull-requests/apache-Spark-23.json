What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark Connect client produces a fair amount of logs but is incorrectly\r\nconfigured at INFO level. When clients set the global log level to INFO,\r\na lot of debug level logs are produced.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince we're using the Python logging utility, it's possible for clients and\r\neven other libraries to set the target log level.\r\nWhen this occurs, a lot of spurious debug log messages are emitted\r\nby the Spark Connect client.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. Spark Connect client logs level will now be produced at debug level\r\nand not info level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually by changing the log levels to see that the messages are emitted\r\nat the right level.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-07T08:35:16Z","updated_at":"2024-08-19T03:21:22Z","closed_at":"2024-08-08T08:46:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ac025b969ddeb2a60b87a84a6b703e8949c2af3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47647/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47647/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47647/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f3a63698b0870e79cbd4e74300d4ca481b4268c1","head":{"label":"nija-at:log-debug","ref":"log-debug","sha":"f3a63698b0870e79cbd4e74300d4ca481b4268c1","user":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":590063058,"node_id":"R_kgDOIyul0g","name":"spark","full_name":"nija-at/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nija-at","id":16217941,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MjE3OTQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16217941?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at","html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nija-at/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nija-at/spark","description":"Apache

that serves multiple Spark sessions to accept and run queries, thus I suppose this patch would benefit STS and Spark Connect use cases.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, this would mitigate a potential Spark driver-side JDBC driver initializing deadlock issue.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nTested in our customer env for a few days, the deadlock has gone after eagerly initializing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR improves `dev/create-release/release-build.sh` by enabling 3-times retry for deploying artifacts to the Nexus staging repository\r\n\r\nWhen I was setting up 3.5.2-rc5 on my AWS EC2 instance, I encountered an issue with closing the `orgapachespark-1461` due to a timeout while uploading a sha1 file.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n

`orgapachespark-1462`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThese changes ensure that implicit grouping key thread locals are set in two places:\r\n\r\n1. When `handleInputRows` is called. This allows for the user to get/set keyed state in the body of `handleInputRows` before they create the iterator that they return (see the UT).\r\n2. When methods on the returned iterator from `handleInputRows` are called.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, if `handleInputRows` returned a lazy iterator, then the following would happen:\r\n\r\n1. The implicit grouping key was set in `processNewData`\r\n2. `handleInputRows` ran, and returned an iterator, call it `iter`\r\n3. The implicit grouping key was unset\r\n4. When the sink finally  causes the iterator to evaluate, the iterator from `handleInputRows` is invoked, but cannot find the implicit grouping key\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- New UT.\r\n- The new UT was verified to fail on current `master`. \r\n- All existing UTs should pass.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-06T23:21:34Z","updated_at":"2024-08-20T01:17:13Z","closed_at":"2024-08-20T01:17:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f50ac933c76d190fd293626fc3dd659bf22b067","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd Spark 3.2 migration guide for `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT...` behavior change. \r\n\r\nSPARK-40819 allows for nanosecond precision in Parquet timestamp type when the config `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.nanosAsLong` is set to `true`. Otherwise, beyond Spark 3.2 there would be a behavior change where Parquet files with type `INT64 (TIMESTAMP(NANOS, true))` are unreadable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis documents a behavior change starting in Spark 3.2 for Parquet files with nanosecond precision for timestamp type.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n`doc build\r\n`\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn file source writing, we disallow duplicated column names in the input query for all formats, because most formats don't do well with duplicate columns. However, this is not a good decision as long as there are formats allowing duplicated column names, and CSV is one of them.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the `FileFormat` API to indicate if the format allows duplicated column names or not, and only perform the duplicated name check for formats that don't allow it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nenable more use cases for the CSV data source\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, now users can write to CSV with duplicated column names.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves Spark SQL Core by adding a bunch of `addArtifact` APIs to `SparkSession`. These APIs were first introduced to Spark Connect a while ago.\r\n\r\nThe follow-up task is for PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo close the API compatibility gap between Spark Connect and Spark Classic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users will be able to use some new APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-06T13:40:30Z","updated_at":"2024-08-30T12:04:48Z","closed_at":"2024-08-30T11:59:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8177245c4467445ff8304501453923114aabeacb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/293563fa9f7b6433328fa8b28e6dd4b150dcfefd","head":{"label":"xupefei:core-add-artifact","ref":"core-add-artifact","sha":"293563fa9f7b6433328fa8b28e6dd4b150dcfefd","user":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":777257207,"node_id":"R_kgDOLlQA9w","name":"spark","full_name":"xupefei/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xupefei","id":1687847,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODc4NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1687847?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei","html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xupefei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xupefei/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to \r\n- fix the `inconsistency` of syntax `show columns` between `v1` and `v2`.\r\n- assign a name `SHOW_COLUMNS_WITH_CONFLICT_NAMESPACE` to the error condition `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1057`.\r\n- unify v1 and v2 `SHOW COLUMNS ...` tests.\r\n- move some UT related to `SHOW COLUMNS` from `DDLSuite` to `command/ShowColumnsSuiteBase` or `v1/ShowColumnsSuiteBase`.\r\n- move some UT related to `SHOW COLUMNS` from `DDLParserSuite` and `ErrorParserSuite` to `ShowColumnsParserSuite`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn `AstBuilder`, we have `a comment` that explains as follows:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/2a752105091ef95f994526b15bae2159657c8ed0/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/parser/AstBuilder.scala#L5054-L5055\r\nHowever, in our v2 of the syntax `show columns` implementation, we `did not` perform the above checks, as shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  withNamespaceAndTable(\"ns\", \"tbl\") { t =>\r\n      sql(s\"CREATE TABLE $t (col1 int, col2 string) $defaultUsing\")\r\n      sql(s\"SHOW COLUMNS IN $t IN ns1\")\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Before (inconsistent, v1 will fail, but v2 will success)\r\n  v1:\r\n  ```\r\n  [SHOW_COLUMNS_WITH_CONFLICT_NAMESPACE] SHOW COLUMNS with conflicting namespace: `ns1` != `ns`.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  v2:\r\n  ```\r\n  Execute successfully.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n#### so, we should fix it.\r\n\r\n- After (consistent, v1 & v2 all will fail)\r\n  v1:\r\n  ```\r\n  [SHOW_COLUMNS_WITH_CONFLICT_NAMESPACE] SHOW COLUMNS with conflicting namespace: `ns1` != `ns`.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  v2:\r\n  ```\r\n  [SHOW_COLUMNS_WITH_CONFLICT_NAMESPACE] SHOW COLUMNS with conflicting namespace: `ns1` != `ns`.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, for v2 tables, in syntax `SHOW COLUMNS {FROM | IN} {tableName} {FROM | IN} {namespace}`, if the namespace (`second parameter`) is different from the namespace of the table(`first parameter`), the command will succeed without any awareness before this PR, after this PR, it will report an error.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new UT.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-06T08:23:49Z","updated_at":"2024-08-30T08:16:58Z","closed_at":"2024-08-30T08:15:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"332cbe1e7f9fa7885b49ccab5402813c2434728b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47628/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47628/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47628/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/25c3e7a7eb94dad9dd8d0f626db59022cb0a047b","head":{"label":"panbingkun:SPARK-49119","ref":"SPARK-49119","sha":"25c3e7a7eb94dad9dd8d0f626db59022cb0a047b","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `docker-image-tool.sh` to be up-to-date.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark 4 dropped Java 11 support. So, we should fix the following.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43005\r\n```\r\n-  - Build and push Java11-based image with tag \"v3.4.0\" to docker.io/myrepo\r\n+  - Build and push Java17-based image with tag \"v4.0.0\" to docker.io/myrepo\r\n```\r\n\r\nApache Spark 4 requires JDK instead of JRE. So, we should fix the following.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45761\r\n```\r\n-    $0 -r docker.io/myrepo -t v3.4.0 -b java_image_tag=11-jre build\r\n+    $0 -r docker.io/myrepo -t v4.0.0 -b java_image_tag=17 build\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, `3.4.0` is too old because it's released on April 13, 2023. We had better use v4.0.0.\r\n```\r\n-    $0 -r docker.io/myrepo -t v3.4.0 -p kubernetes/dockerfiles/spark/bindings/python/Dockerfile build\r\n+    $0 -r docker.io/myrepo -t v4.0.0 -p kubernetes/dockerfiles/spark/bindings/python/Dockerfile build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo functional change because this is a usage message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual review.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-05T21:47:34Z","updated_at":"2024-08-06T02:27:28Z","closed_at":"2024-08-06T01:43:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fd9b7f0bbe3efa9966df38a7703f1d011b560d73","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47618/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47618/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47618/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ee8ceb2537be369ec36c0a2a08cf6f36a30f1c1","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-49117","ref":"SPARK-49117","sha":"3ee8ceb2537be369ec36c0a2a08cf6f36a30f1c1","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix `InvalidDefaultArgInFrom` in Python/R binding Dockerfiles by providing the default value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen a user builds Apache Spark docker images, he/she meets the following warning currently.\r\n```\r\n 1 warning found (use docker --debug to expand):\r\n - InvalidDefaultArgInFrom: Default value for ARG $base_img results in empty or invalid base image name (line 20)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is an official guide line to fix it.\r\n- https://docs.docker.com/reference/build-checks/invalid-default-arg-in-from/\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nThe provided default value is the same one for the following command. We usually provide REPO and TAG to override this.\r\n```\r\nbin/docker-image-tool.sh -p kubernetes/dockerfiles/spark/bindings/python/Dockerfile -n build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual build the distribution and docker images.\r\n```\r\n$ NO_MANUAL=1 ./dev/make-distribution.sh -Pkubernetes\r\n$ bin/docker-image-tool.sh -p kubernetes/dockerfiles/spark/bindings/python/Dockerfile -n build\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```\r\n...\r\n 1 warning found (use docker --debug to expand):\r\n - InvalidDefaultArgInFrom: Default value

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd SQL support for creating identity columns. Users can specify a column `GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY(identityColumnSpec)` , where identity values are **always** generated by the system, or `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(identityColumnSpec)`, where users can specify the identity values. \r\n\r\nUsers can optionally specify the starting value of the column (default = 1) and the increment/step of the column (default = 1). Also we allow both\r\n`START WITH <start> INCREMENT BY <step>` \r\nand \r\n`INCREMENT BY <step> START WITH <start>`\r\n\r\nIt allows flexible ordering of the increment and starting values, as both variants are used in the wild by other systems (e.g. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsequence.html) [Oracle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/CREATE-SEQUENCE.html#GUID-E9C78A8C-615A-4757-B2A8-5E6EFB130571)).\r\n\r\nFor example, we can define\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE default.example (\r\n  id LONG GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,\r\n  id1 LONG GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY(),\r\n  id2 LONG GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 0),\r\n  id3 LONG GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY(INCREMENT BY 2),\r\n  id4 LONG GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY(START WITH 0 INCREMENT BY -10),\r\n  id5 LONG GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY(INCREMENT BY 2 START WITH -8),\r\n  value LONG\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis will enable defining identity columns in Spark SQL for data sources that support it.\r\n\r\nTo be more specific this PR\r\n\r\n- Adds parser support for GENERATED { BY DEFAULT | ALWAYS } AS IDENTITY in create/replace table statements. Identity column specifications are temporarily stored in the field's metadata, and then are parsed/verified in DataSourceV2Strategy and used to instantiate v2 [Column]\r\n- Adds TableCatalog::capabilities() and TableCatalogCapability.SUPPORTS_CREATE_TABLE_WITH_IDENTITY_COLUMNS This will be used to determine whether to allow specifying identity columns or whether to throw an exception.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nA SQL API is needed to create Identity Columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt allows the aforementioned SQL syntax to create identity columns in a table.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPositive and negative unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

We found that the perf regression still exists after that fix and located the culprit is the immutable conversion on `TaskMetrics#externalAccums`. This PR fixes it by avoiding the immutable conversion, and then enforce the read lock protection during the accessing on `TaskMetrics#externalAccums` to avoid the race issue (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40663).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix perf regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

We found that the perf regression still exists after that fix and located the culprit is the immutable conversion on `TaskMetrics#externalAccums`. This PR fixes it by avoiding the immutable conversion, and then enforce the read lock protection during the accessing on `TaskMetrics#externalAccums` to avoid the race issue (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40663).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix perf regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn this PR I propose that we do not assert and fail queries when `V2ExpressionBuilder` returns class that is not predicate. Instead I suggest that we silently swallow the exception, add log, and continue execution of query.\r\n\r\n`V2ExpressionBuilder` has no compiler gurantees that `Predicate` will be returned. With this in mind, its very easy to add regressions that will suddenly start failing queries, without a workaround for users, other than code change.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I suggest we add a flag, which when enabled, will absorb this bugs in `V2ExpressionBuilder`.\r\n\r\nIt is as if we are saying:\r\n - If we are trying to translate catalyst expression to `V2Expression` and are requesting `Predicate`, if predicate is not returned act as if we didn't know how to translate expression at all.\r\n\r\nWe return None, and rest of the system handles it as if we didn't know to translate to `V2Expression`\r\n\r\nMore details in JIRA ticket\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nQueries that failed because of pushdown failure, will now skip pushing down offending predicate, rather than failing the whole query.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

PR is recreation of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47403 and adds few minor changes to support execution over Spark Connect as well.\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request introduces the logic of SQL scripts execution, with minor additional changes to support the execution over Spark Connect as well. We decided to do these two changes together because they are tightly coupled and SQL script execution in general has been driven a lot by having Spark Connect in mind.\r\n\r\nMain design decision is that, from the correctness perspective, SQL scripts need to be executed eagerly. Examples:\r\n- Select from table `t` followed by table `t` drop statement - if not executed eagerly, it would throw an exception which is not correct.\r\n- Exception handling - SQL standard for scripting requires exception handlers. If we don't execute statements eagerly, the potential exceptions wouldn't be handled when/where it is supposed to happen.\r\n- Bunch of correctness examples - select from `t`, insert into `t`, select from `t` - if not executed eagerly, both selects would return the same results, which might not be correct, etc.\r\n\r\nFollowing changes are proposed for SQL script execution:\r\n- introduction of `spark.sql.scripting.enabled` flag to enable SQL scripting execution\r\n- execution nodes changes:\r\n  - introduction of `execute()` function to leaf execution nodes (`SingleStatementExec`) - for now, implements a simple way of collecting results in the in-memory variable.\r\n  - simplified hierarchy of non-leaf execution nodes - removing `CompoundNestedStatementIteratorExec`; now we have only `CompoundBodyExec`.\r\n  - while iterating through `CompoundBody` in `CompoundBodyExec's` iterator, we are calling `execute()` function of each leaf statement (eager execution).\r\n- interpreter changes:\r\n  - introduction of `execute()` function - instead of doing it externally, `execute` is now suppose to collect results from the last executed statement in the SQL scripts; in the future we will introduce API that can return results from multiple statements and we might change naming then, but for now for the sake of simplicity, it's called `execute`.\r\n  - `execute()` calls `executeInternal()` to collect results from all the statements and takes only the last one. Aforementioned API for multiple results will reuse `executeInternal()` and have logic to collect results from all statements.\r\n  - `shouldCollectResults = true` is passed only to standalone `SingleStatementExec` nodes - for example, if `SingleStatementExec` is a part of If/Else condition we don't want to collect its results, we want to collect results only from standalone SQL statements.\r\n\r\nTo support execution over SparkConnect, few simple changes were made:\r\n- `SqlScriptingLogicalOperators` -> `SqlScriptingLogicalPlans`:\r\n  - logical operators are now logical plans, and more specifically, our root logical plan (`CompoundBody`) is a `Command`.\r\n  - Spark Connect supports eager execution of `Commands` out of the box and that's why we went with this approach.\r\n  - this means we don't need `parseScript()` in `ParserInterface` anymore, we can simply use already existing `parsePlan()`.\r\n- To support eager execution, results are returned wrapped into `LocalRelation` - to be able to differentiate SQL scripts here, we have added `isSqlScript` flag to `LocalRelation`. Check `SparkSession.sql()` to see how `LocalRelation` is constructed.\r\n- `SparkConnectPlanner.handleSqlCommand` - now that SQL script is handled as a `Command`, it's only left to make sure that in cases of SQL scripts the eager execution path is selected and this is done based on the `isSqlScript` flag from `LocalRelation`.\r\n\r\nSide changes:\r\n- Disallowing labels for a top level compound - once we changes `CompoundBody` to become `LogicalPlan` and altered `parsePlan` to support both compound statements and single SQL statements, we encountered an issue with parse exception reporting:\r\n  - example: `SELCT 100` would return exception message `... near \\`100\\`` whereas it should return `near \\`SELCT\\``.\r\n  - reason: `CompoundBody` has optional label before `BEGIN`, which was specified in the grammar as `multipartIdentifier COLON` which meant that spaces could exist between identifier and colon - this means that `SELCT` would get matched to `multipartIdentifier` and `100` would get to be matched against `COLON` which fails.\r\n  - solution: we tried to adapt lexer and parser to change this behavior, but it turns out to be too complex. So, for now, we are removing that from the scope of this PR, a will do a follow-up once we figure out how to properly introduce new token for labels (that wouldn't cause ambiguity with other tokens).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA series of previous pull requests introduced various SQL scripting concepts. This pull request, however, introduces the ability to actually execute SQL scripts using Spark.\r\nFor now, users will need to enable SQL scripting first using `spark.sql.scripting.enabled` and then use `SparkSession.sql()` function to execute SQL scripts. In case that a SQL script is provided, instead of a standalone SQL statement, the result of the last executed statement will be returned.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n`SparkSession.sql()` is altered to support execution of SQL scripts as well. For standalone SQL statements nothing is changed, but in case a SQL script is provided (wrapped in a `BEGIN ... END`) it will be successfully processed and results will be returned.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere are already existing test suites for SQL scripting that have been improved to test new functionalities:\r\n- `SqlScriptingParserSuite`\r\n- `SqlScriptingExecutionNodeSuite`\r\n- `SqlScriptingInterpreterSuite`\r\n\r\nAlso, `SqlScriptingE2eSuite` has been introduced as well. It's not focusing on parser/interpreter functionalities/correctness, but rather on various usage stuff - whether API can handle SQL scripts properly or whether results are returned in proper format or whether config flags have been applied properly etc.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-05T13:11:24Z","updated_at":"2024-11-04T08:59:55Z","closed_at":"2024-11-04T08:59:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/123d7a4f095262bf4332bf77b441b9c668f32eb2","head":{"label":"davidm-db:scripting_over_spark_connect","ref":"scripting_over_spark_connect","sha":"123d7a4f095262bf4332bf77b441b9c668f32eb2","user":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":775065390,"node_id":"R_kgDOLjKPLg","name":"spark","full_name":"davidm-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davidm-db","id":163021185,"node_id":"U_kgDOCbeBgQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/163021185?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db","html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davidm-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davidm-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies `SubqueryAlias` to always propagate the metadata output of its child, even if the child is not a `SubqueryAlias` or a `LeafNode`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is needed because with these changes it is not possible to read metadata columns when reading a table with a CHAR column when read-side padding is enabled. In the case the plan is `SubqueryAlias(Project(LeafNode)))`, so without this patch the metadata output is not propagated.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, there will be more cases in which the metadata columns can be accessed, and users will no longer get an exception in these cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a case to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `spark.master.rest.filters` configuration like the existing `spark.ui.filters` configuration.\r\n\r\nRecently, Apache Spark starts to support `JWSFilter`. We can take advantage of `JWSFilter` to protect Spark Master REST API.\r\n- #47575\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nLike `Spark UI`, we had better provide the same capability to Apache Spark Master REST API .\r\n\r\nFor example, we can protect `JWSFilter` to `Spark Master REST API` like the following.\r\n\r\n**MASTER REST API WITH JWSFilter**\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt package\r\n$ cp jjwt-impl-0.12.6.jar assembly/target/scala-2.13/jars\r\n$ cp jjwt-jackson-0.12.6.jar assembly/target/scala-2.13/jars\r\n$ SPARK_NO_DAEMONIZE=1

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRefactor CatalogManager.setCurrentNamespace so it unifies the handling of `SupportsNamespaces` and SessionCatalog, thus it can respect custom session catalog.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a bug.\r\n\r\nCatalogManager.setCurrentNamespace should respect custom session catalog. Without this PR, a custom session catalog won't work as Spark uses `spark_catalog` to see if the catalog is session log and then directly call V1SessionCatalog.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to enhance comparison logic to avoid precision loss in decimal parts of `Decimal` in Avro data source. It refers to the related logic of convert `Decimal` type in `Parquet` data source #44513 .\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n- As long as the length of the integer part(`precision - scale`) matches, it can be converted.\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n- Both the integer(`precision - scale`) and decimal part(`scale`) lengths must match.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFixed the issue causing missing data accuracy.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, stricter matching requirements for conversions between Spark `DecimalType` and `Avro` Decimal type.\r\n\r\nPreviously, decimal(12,10) -> decimal(5,3) was allowed, but there would be some loss of precision in the decimal part, such as: 13.1234567890 -> 13.123\r\nAfter that, the exception `avroIncompatibleReadError` will be thrown, because 3 is not greater than or equal 10. Unless both the integer and the decimal part are greater than or equal. For example, decimal(15, 13) is OK because 13>=10 and 15-13>=12-10\r\n\r\nBut users can restore the legacy behavior, set `spark.sql.legacy.avro.allowIncompatibleDecimalType` to `true`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA and add new test cases.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47157 that moves `connect` into `sql/connect`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe reasons are as follow:\r\n- There was a bit of question about moving `connect` as a standalone top level (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47157#issuecomment-2202337766).\r\n- Technically all Spark Connect related code have to placed under `sql` just like Hive thrift server.\r\n  - Spark Connect server is 99% SQL dedicated code for now\r\n  - Spark Connect server already is using a lot of `spark.sql` configurations, e.g., `spark.sql.connect.serverStacktrace.enabled`\r\n  - Spark Connect common is only for SQL module. If other components have to be implemented, that common has to be placed within that directory.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI in this PR should verify it.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-08-02T04:09:30Z","updated_at":"2024-08-02T07:51:10Z","closed_at":"2024-08-02T07:51:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a43d6afeb6d3fd8e7439af1a010d1da78255db5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

We found that the perf regression still exists after that fix and located the culprit is the immutable conversion on `TaskMetrics#externalAccums`. This PR fixes it by avoiding the immutable conversion, and then enforce the read lock protection during the accessing on `TaskMetrics#externalAccums` to avoid the race issue (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40663).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFix perf regression.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

`JWSFilter` will check the following for all requests.\r\n- The HTTP request should have `Authorization: Bearer <jws>` header.\r\n  - `<jws>` is a string with three fields, `<header>.<payload>.<signature>`.\r\n  - `<header>` is supposed to be a base64url-encoded string of `{\"alg\":\"HS256\",\"typ\":\"JWT\"}`.\r\n  - `<payload>` is a base64url-encoded string of fully-user-defined content.\r\n  - `<signature>` is a signature based on `<header>.<payload>` and a user-provided key parameter.\r\n\r\nFor example, the value of `<header>` will be `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9` always and the value of `payload` can be `e30` if the payload is empty, `{}`. The `<signature>` part is changed by the shared value of `spark.org.apache.spark.ui.JWSFilter.param.key` between the server and client.\r\n```\r\njshell> java.util.Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString(\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"HS256\\\",\\\"typ\\\":\\\"JWT\\\"}\".getBytes())\r\n$2 ==> \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9\"\r\n\r\njshell> java.util.Base64.getUrlEncoder().encodeToString(\"{}\".getBytes())\r\n$3 ==> \"e30=\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo provide a little better security on WebUI consistently

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd support for reading transformWithState value state variables with state data source reader\r\n\r\nCo-authored with @jingz-db \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanges are needed to integrate reading state reading with new operator metadata and state schema format for the value state types used in state variables within transformWithState\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\n\r\nUsers can now read valueState variables used in the `transformWithState` operator using the state data source reader.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark\r\n   .read\r\n   .format(\"statestore\")\r\n   .option(\"operatorId\", <operatorId>)\r\n   .option(\"stateVarName\", <varName>)\r\n   .load(<state

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR introduces a separate FunctionRegistry for functions used by the Column API that should not be exposed in the global function namespace. This internal registry is only used when then the `UnresolvedFunction` has the `isInternal` flag set to `true`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to create a Column API shared by the Classic and Connect Scala Clients. This requires that we fully decouple the Column API from Catalyst.

Physical plan for `select count(distinct 1) from t`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- count(distinct 1)\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[count(distinct 1)], output=[count(DISTINCT 1)#2L])\r\n   +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[partial_count(distinct 1)], output=[count#6L])\r\n      +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])\r\n         +- Exchange SinglePartition, ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=20]\r\n            +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])\r\n               +- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.t[] Batched: false, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/nikola.mandic/oss-spark/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.s..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<>\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is happening when `HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])` node yields one row to `partial_count` node, which then captures one row. This four-node structure is constructed by `AggUtils.planAggregateWithOneDistinct`.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, we're adding `Expand` node which will force non-empty grouping expressions in `HashAggregateExec` nodes. This will in turn enable streaming zero rows to parent `partial_count` node, yielding correct final result.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAggregation with DISTINCT literal gives wrong results. For example, when running on empty table `t`:\r\n`select count(distinct 1) from t` returns 1, while the correct result should be 0.\r\nFor reference:\r\n`select count(1) from t` returns 0, which is the correct and expected result.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this fixes a critical bug in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew e2e SQL tests for aggregates with DISTINCT literals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Physical plan for `select count(distinct 1) from t`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- count(distinct 1)\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[count(distinct 1)], output=[count(DISTINCT 1)#2L])\r\n   +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[partial_count(distinct 1)], output=[count#6L])\r\n      +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])\r\n         +- Exchange SinglePartition, ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=20]\r\n            +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])\r\n               +- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.t[] Batched: false, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/nikola.mandic/oss-spark/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.s..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<>\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is happening when `HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])` node yields one row to `partial_count` node, which then captures one row. This four-node structure is constructed by `AggUtils.planAggregateWithOneDistinct`.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, we're adding `Expand` node which will force non-empty grouping expressions in `HashAggregateExec` nodes. This will in turn enable streaming zero rows to parent `partial_count` node, yielding correct final result.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAggregation with DISTINCT literal gives wrong results. For example, when running on empty table `t`:\r\n`select count(distinct 1) from t` returns 1, while the correct result should be 0.\r\nFor reference:\r\n`select count(1) from t` returns 0, which is the correct and expected result.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this fixes a critical bug in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew e2e SQL tests for aggregates with DISTINCT literals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix `RewriteDistinctAggregates` rule to deal properly with aggregation on DISTINCT literals. Physical plan for `select count(distinct 1) from t`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-- count(distinct 1)\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[count(distinct 1)], output=[count(DISTINCT 1)#2L])\r\n   +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[partial_count(distinct 1)], output=[count#6L])\r\n      +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])\r\n         +- Exchange SinglePartition, ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=20]\r\n            +- HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])\r\n               +- FileScan parquet spark_catalog.default.t[] Batched: false, DataFilters: [], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/nikola.mandic/oss-spark/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.s..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<>\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is happening when `HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[], output=[])` node yields one row to `partial_count` node, which then captures one row. This four-node structure is constructed by `AggUtils.planAggregateWithOneDistinct`.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, we're adding `Expand` node which will force non-empty grouping expressions in `HashAggregateExec` nodes. This will in turn enable streaming zero rows to parent `partial_count` node, yielding correct final result.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAggregation with DISTINCT literal gives wrong results. For example, when running on empty table `t`:\r\n`select count(distinct 1) from t` returns 1, while the correct result should be 0.\r\nFor reference:\r\n`select count(1) from t` returns 0, which is the correct and expected result.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, this fixes a critical bug in Spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew e2e SQL tests for aggregates with DISTINCT literals.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr moves the global scope test configuration `spark.hadoop.hadoop.security.key.provider.path`, which is configured in the parent `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild.scala`, to `OrcEncryptionSuite` to ensure that it is effective only within `OrcEncryptionSuite`.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, the pr also refactors `OrcEncryptionSuite`:\r\n1. Overrides `beforeAll` to back up the contents of `CryptoUtils#keyProviderCache`.\r\n2. Overrides `afterAll` to restore the contents of `CryptoUtils#keyProviderCache`.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that `CryptoUtils#keyProviderCache` is isolated during the test process of `OrcEncryptionSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe test configuration `spark.hadoop.hadoop.security.key.provider.path` in the parent `pom.xml` and `SparkBuild.scala` is effective globally, which leads to the possibility that other Orc writing test cases, besides `OrcEncryptionSuite`, might also be affected by this configuration and use `test.org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.orc.FakeKeyProvider.Factory`。\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `actualSize` method of the `VARIANT` `columnType` isn't overridden, so we use the default size of 2kb for the `actualSize`. We should define `actualSize` so the cached variant column can correctly be written to the byte buffer.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if the avg per-variant size is greater than 2KB and the total column size is greater than 128KB (the default initial buffer size), an exception will be (incorrectly) thrown.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nto fix caching larger variants (in df.cache()), such as the ones included in the UTs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nadded UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative
