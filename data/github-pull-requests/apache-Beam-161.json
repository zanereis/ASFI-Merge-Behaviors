Background\r\n\r\nMy first attempts at using RabbitMq in Beam were quite problematic. Watermarking did not advance as expected, CheckpointMarks would fail as amqp channels could be severed during processing, deduplication of messages was optional but hard-coded to an awkward implementation that only looked at the 'correlation id' amqp property, which isn't necessarily unique. In short, this did not behave like a top-tier IO connector.\r\n\r\nI had a great Q&A with the Beam Dev DL (see https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@beam.apache.org/msg17149.html ) and I have a pretty substantial refactor ready for review.\r\n\r\n## Open Questions\r\n\r\nI don't know the best process to follow here. This is a lot of change, and there isn't a backing ticket for much (or any) of it right now. Seems like there at least should be.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm wondering if I could/should be part of the `OWNERS` for this module if this gets merged. It seems there aren't many eyes on rabbitmq IO and I'm happy to help out if I can.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n***Note** This will not be binary compatible with previous versions of rabbitmq io. End users *will* have to update code. I think given the level of 'not working' I experienced as a user of rabbitmq with beam, this is ok. But we can discuss.\r\n\r\nI'll break this apart into manageable sections:\r\n\r\n### Structural Changes\r\n\r\n- I've followed the `KafkaIO` connector's convention of separating many of these classes into separate files. It's been very difficult to trace the code with everything in `RabbitMqIo.java`.\r\n- Standardized on file/class prefix `RabbitMq`\r\n\r\n### RabbitMqIO Changes\r\n\r\n- I've explicitly dropped support for declaring an exchange. I can't find a valid use case for this with Beam and it's unnecessary code complexity.\r\n- More clearly documented supported use cases.\r\n- Refactored the API and documentation to drop terminology indicating one 'writes to / reads from an exchange vs writes to / reads from a queue'. In AMQP 0.9, one always writes to an exchange and always reads from a queue. Instead, the caller now just specifies whether the queue already exists (simple use case) or if it may need creating (more complex), with a `ReadParadigm` interface defining this. Similarly, writing is always done to an exchange. `RabbitMqMessage` should already contain an appropriate routing key.\r\n- Supports pluggable connection handlers (more on this in `Resource Management` below)\r\n- Supports pluggable message deduplication strategies, but a strategy is now required). More on this in `Message Deduplication` below.\r\n- Supports total backlog bytes estimation, with some caveats. Mostly stolen from KafkaIO's implementation.\r\n- Reworked `RabbitMqMessage` to use AutoValue.\r\n\r\n### Message Deduplication\r\n\r\n- Previously, this was user-toggled. Given CheckpointMark finalizing can fail, this should not be considered an optional operation. `requiresDeduping` is now hard-coded to `true`\r\n- Strategy for detecting duplicate messages is pluggable, with several implementations already built-in to choose from. The previous default was the amqp property `correlationId` but this is not a safe choice. Many messages could be correlated to the same upstream event. Amqp property `messageId` would be a better choice, if implemented, but there are others the user can choose from, including `always unique` which effectively disables deduping.\r\n\r\n### Resource Management\r\n\r\n- I borrowed connection management from `JdbcIO` in terms of maintaining a static map of `Connection`s tied to a remote URI. In AMQP, one multiplexes over Connections via Channels.\r\n- For better Channel management, each reader and writer now has a unique id (`UUID`) and I use the borrower (or lender) pattern to define what work should be done along the channel, but keep channel/connection management outside of the caller's concern to ensure consistent error handling, recovery, etc.\r\n\r\n### Checkpoint Marks\r\n\r\n***Assumption** This refactor is oriented around the following assumptions: 1) a CheckpointMark is associated with zero or one current Readers, but no more; 2) a CheckpointMark may outlive a Reader, but the converse is not true.\r\n\r\n- Dropped support for amqp transactions. They serve no purpose in this streaming model and in general should just be adding overhead. Messages are acknowledged or they aren't; that's transactional enough.\r\n- RabbitMqCheckpointMark may outlive a reader, so it's now responsible for closing an active channel if the checkpoint mark is finalized and there are no more reads happening\r\n- RabbitMqCheckpointMark is no longer re-used across readers. A new one will be instantiated any time a Reader is instantiated as there's no way safe way to 'recover' a deserialized CheckpointMark and still acknowledge messages. \r\n\r\n### Watermarks and Timestamps\r\n\r\n- I've basically re-implemented a dynamic watermarking strategy based off `Kafka`'s. Like Kafka, I've made the implementation pluggable, with the dynamic `CustomTimestampPolicyWithLimitedDelay` and the default `ProcessingTimePolicy`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nI've done some testing in Dataflow and locally and I believe things are behaving correctly and this is in a pretty good state, so I wanted to start soliciting feedback now.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the downstream receiver, I collapsed all the harness `FnDataReceiver` types into two existing implementations and one new implementation.\r\nThe previous hierarchy was:\r\n```\r\nelement counting receiver -> time counting receiver -> multiplexing receiver (possibly the original receiver)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current implementation combined the element counting, time counting and multiplexing into the `MultiplexingMetricTrackingFnDataReceiver` while for the singleton case into the `MetricTrackingFnDataReceiver`.\r\n\r\nTo propagate splits, a `SplittingMetricTrackingFnDataReceiver` was created that extends the MetricTrackingFnDataReceiver. Note, like in [Python](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/c167d8ef99b21148bcab7c37538a6ef2f64864c7/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/worker/operations.py#L133), there is currently no support for splitting a multiplexed consumer.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR fixes both issues because (1) one fix depends on the other, and (2) to make it easier to validate/cherry pick into 2.18.0's branch.\r\n\r\nBEAM-9041: Don't rely on equality for the from/to functions in `SchemaCoder` because nobody implements equals on `SerializableFunction`. I tried to do this with byte equality, maybe there is a better way to do it but I could not think of another.\r\nBEAM-9042: Since Avro's `Schema` class is not `Serializable` I made it `transient`. Another approach could have been to transform the Schema into a String (not sure if this is needed but I can change it if you think it is worth).\r\n\r\nR: @TheNeuralBit

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9020 .\r\n\r\nAttempt for BEAM-8695 LengthPrefixUnknownCodersTest failed when trying to upgrade google-http-client to v1.34.0, because LengthPrefixUnknownCodersTest relies on the equality of CloudObject with Map.\r\n\r\nWith that version, GenericData has its own equals method ([PR#589](https://github.com/googleapis/google-http-java-client/pull/589/files#diff-914cd7ff18143b3d2398149e1cfb4f45R218))  that checks classInfo and thus the comparisons between a CloudObject and a Map always fail.\r\n\r\nTherefore LengthPrefixUnknownCodersTest should not rely on AbstractMap's equality.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

doesn't let you omit the `-> None` return type for `__init__` methods, nor does it let you add a hint for just a function's return type (like `# type: (...) -> None`). This PR adds full function signature type hints to the `__init__` methods for `Pipeline` and `PipelineOptions` (so far the only places I've seen issues with pytype parsing these hints).\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK | Apex | Dataflow |

submitting a Python word count job to a Flink session/standalone cluster repeatedly, the meta space usage of the task manager of the Flink cluster will continuously increase (about 40MB each time). The reason is that the Beam classes are loaded with the user class loader in Flink and There are problems with the implementation of `ProcessManager`(from Beam) and `ThreadPoolCache`(from netty) which may cause the user class loader could not be garbage collected even after the job finished which causes the meta space memory leak eventually. You can refer to FLINK-15338[1] for more information.\r\n\r\nRegarding to `ProcessManager`, I have created a JIRA BEAM-9006[2] to track it. Regarding to `ThreadPoolCache`, it is a Netty problem and has been fixed in NETTY#8955[3]. Netty 4.1.35 Final has already included this fix and GRPC 1.22.0 has already dependents on Netty 4.1.35 Final. So this PR is bump the version of GRPC to 1.26.0+ (currently 1.21.0).\r\n\r\n[1] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-15338\r\n[2] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9006\r\n[3]

this PR will solve the garbage collection issue as currently the class `ProcessManager` will add a shutdown hook to stop all the living processes before JVM exits. The shutdown hook will never be removed. If this class is loaded by the user class loader, it will cause the user class loader could not be garbage collected which causes meta space memory leak eventually.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on

off a race condition where a closing DataChannel might have new readers created for it while it is failing, causing stuckness in the bundles.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the c.readErr must be interacted while c.mu is held. \r\nOtherwise something like the following happens.\r\nGiven a channel C, and goroutines G1,G2.\r\n1. G1 A request for a new reader on C arrives, checks C.readErr finds it null.\r\n2. G2 An error occurs on reading. The lock is acquired, and C.readErr is set. Readers are closed. The channel is officially closed with A.forceRecreate, removing it from the DataManager cache.\r\n3. G1 calls A.makeReader, and creates a new reader there.\r\n\r\nThere could be an arbitrary number of G1s.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

affects Python's tempfile module, which should improve\r\nperformance for tests that scan /tmp.\r\n\r\nEx: If a test pipeline writes sharded files to the prefix `/tmp/tmp74ic4z8l` (not a directory, generated via tempfile.mkstemp or tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile), then it will very likely scan the containing directory `/tmp` for files matching the tmp and output file glob pattern (see `FileSystems.match()` calls in `FileBasedSink`).\r\n\r\nAlternatively: these tests could be fixed to create a subdir in /tmp or\r\nperiodically clean up /tmp on Jenkins nodes.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`DataStoreV1Table` and `DataStoreV1TableProvder`.\r\nDataStoreV1 sends fields in the arbitrary order (when reading from it), current implementation relies on the the Beam schema to determine order when constructing rows. This means that the Beam schema must have the exact same schema as the DataStore `Type` we are reading from (order and field names).\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n- [x] Replace Conversion map with `switch-case` statements\r\n- [x] JavaDoc\r\n- [x] Read key ids (optional field `__key__` in row schema of type `VARBINARY`)\r\n- [x] Writing back with user-set keys (use one of the fields ex: `__key__`)\r\n  - When field is `null` or does not exist - use randomly generated id\r\n- [x] TableProperty to allow user specify the field to read/write the key into/from (default `__key__`).\r\n- [x] Support nested fields\r\n- [x] Support arrays (w/ complex types, ex: arrays, rows, etc.)\r\n- [x] Support arrays (w/ simple types, ex: int64, String, etc.)\r\n- [x] Implement `buildIOWriter`\r\n- [x] Implement `getTableStatistics`\r\n\r\nProposed design [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxuEGewJ3GPDl0IKglfOYf1edwa2m_wryFZYRMpRNbA/edit?pli=1).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is based on https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10010 which was just a start: \r\n- tests were not running because of the addition of MockHttpPlugin in ES7 test framework\r\n- some ES7 ifs were missed in ESIO code\r\n- timeout API was removed so uniformisation among versions was needed in public api. \r\n- read output json has changed in ES7\r\n- retry_on_conflict parameter has changed in ES7\r\n- fix dependencies and upgrade versions\r\n- removed an irrelevant test\r\nSee commit log \r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

avoid the runtime overhead of continuously reporting accumulators from the\r\nTaskManagers to the JobManager, we can defer the reporting of the metrics\r\naccumulator until the pipeline shuts down. A final snapshot of the accumulators\r\nwill be reported then.\r\n\r\nThis means the metrics will still be available in the PipelineResult. Of course,\r\nthe metrics reporting via Flink is not affected by this change.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
