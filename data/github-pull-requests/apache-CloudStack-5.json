Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with storage volume migrations when a storage pool (source or destination) has ScopeType.HOST set.  Prior to this PR, the code in StorageSystemDataMotionStrategy selected any host in the cluster if the source storage pool did not have a cluster ID, or a host in the cluster if it did.  This effectively breaks ScopeType.HOST copies except when the selection resulted in the specific host the other storage pool resides on.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a race condition with multiple Linstor primary storages and different controller IP's.\r\n\r\nThe client.setBasePath() would overwrite the Linstor controller IP/host for all current client users. This is basically a race condition that triggered as soon as you had configured 2 different primary storages with different Linstor controllers.\r\n\r\n<!---

with Xenserver so storage pool creation was failing during setup, and not cleaning up the created cluster.\r\nThis causes cluster create to fail if the test is retried.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR...\r\n\r\nFixes #9295 \r\n\r\nWhen a host is in maintenance, CreateStoragePoolCommand and DeleteStoragePoolCommand are not allowed to execute by the AgentAttache.\r\nThis will cause a new storage pool to not be present on the host even after it comes out of maintenance, as the cloudstack agent is not restarted when cancel maintain is called (#3239).\r\nThis also causes a deleted storage pool to never be removed from a host in maintenance.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features,

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR...\r\n\r\nFixes #9295 \r\n\r\nNew storage pools are not added to a host which is in maintenance. This change will restart the agent when host is taken out of maintenance mode. StoragePoolMonitor.processConnect() will then get called which will add/mount the new storage pool to the host. \r\n\r\nOne more related issue was that storage pool was not getting unmounted from a host in maintenance mode. Even when the host is taken out of maintenance mode, it will still have the pool mounted. Only reboot will unmount the pool.\r\nSo, as fix have added DeleteStoragePoolCommand to be able to run in maintenance mode similar to ModifyStoragePoolCommand.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in

Description\r\n\r\nEarlier the triggerShutdown API would immediately shutdown the MS and if it is the same MS on which API is called and there are no pending jobs it would lead to error in the API

Description\r\n\r\nrevertSnapshot uses currently the UUID instead of the path, which defines the resource group on linstor and is set matching to the path when creating a snapshot. This PR just replaces the UUID by path of a snapshot.\r\n\r\nThis PR is done against 4.19 as 4.18 has been refactored in between.\r\n\r\n<!---

nodes as KVM-Hosts used for ACS.\r\n* Ubuntu 22.04, compiled 4.19 as package, used a non productive cluster to test\r\n* Previous situation: create volume snapshot, create a file in running instance, shutdown instance, try to restore via GUI: Failure as volume cannot be found (which happens if volume has not been initially created in linstor)\r\n* Fixed sitation: same actions, but restore works and disk is verified in state of snapshot after starting instance.","created_at":"2024-06-19T15:08:43Z","updated_at":"2024-07-24T07:45:23Z","closed_at":"2024-06-20T08:52:50Z","merged_at":"2024-06-20T08:52:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"7dce3d87d4875ea17553533a57f9a248c9186c2a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073278,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:primary-storage","name":"component:primary-storage","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5650616953,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M8AAAABUM2SeQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/has-3rdparty-components","name":"has-3rdparty-components","color":"8AD653","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6349151312,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M8AAAABenBcUA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/3rd-party:linstor","name":"3rd-party:linstor","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/31","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/31","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/31/labels","id":9981290,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AmE1q","number":31,"title":"4.19.1.0","description":"issues

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR solves issue #8907.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when taking a volume snapshot/backup with KVM as the hypervisor, it is always a full snapshot/backup. However, always taking full snapshots of volumes is costly for both the storage network and storage systems. To solve the aforementioned issues, this PR extends the volume snapshot feature in KVM, allowing users to create incremental volume snapshots using KVM as a hypervisor.\r\n\r\nTo give operators control over which type of snapshot is being created, a new global setting `kvm.incremental.snapshot` has been added, which can be changed at zone and cluster scopes; this setting is false by default. Also, the `snapshot.delta.max` configuration, used to control the maximum deltas when using XenServer, was extended to also limit the size of the backing chain of snapshots on primary/secondary storage. \r\n\r\nThis functionality is only available in environments with Libvirt 7.6.0+ and qemu 6.1+. If the `kvm.incremental.snapshot` setting is true, and the hosts do not have the required Libvirt and qemu versions, an error will be thrown when trying to take a snapshot. Additionally, this functionality is only available when using file based storage, such as shared mount-point (iSCSI and FC that require a shared mount-point storage file system for KVM such as OCFS2 or GlusterFS), NFS, and local storage. Other storage types for KVM, such as CLVM and RBD, need different approaches to enable incremental backups; therefore, these are not currently supported.\r\n\r\nIssue #8907 has more details and flowcharts of all the mapped workflows.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n# Description of tests\r\n\r\nDuring testing, the `kvm.incremental.snapshot` setting was changed to `true` and the `snapshot.delta.max` setting was changed to 3.\r\n\r\n## Tests with snapshot.backup.to.secondary = false\r\n\r\nFor the tests in this section, a test VM was created and reused for all tests.\r\n\r\n### Snapshot creation tests\r\n\r\n| Test | Result |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| Access the VM, create any file in it and create volume snapshot 1 while the VM running | Full snapshot created |\r\n| Access the VM, create a second file in it, create volume snapshot 2 while the VM running | Incremental snapshot created with correct size and backing chain (snapshot 1) |\r\n| Stop the VM and create volume snapshot 3 | Correctly created incremental snapshot |\r\n| Start the VM again, create volume snapshot 4 | Full snapshot created |\r\n| Migrate the VM and create volume snapshot 5 | Incremental snapshot created from snapshot 4 |\r\n| Migrate VM + ROOT volume | Exception |\r\n\r\n### Snapshot restore tests\r\n\r\n| Test | Result |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| Access the VM, delete all previously created files, stop the VM, restore snapshot 1 and start the VM again | Restoration correctly performed, the file created in snapshot creation test 1 was present on the volume |\r\n| Access the VM, delete the file restored in snapshot restore test 2, stop the VM, restore snapshot 2 and start the VM again | Restoration correctly performed, the files created in tests 1 and 2 of snapshot creation were present on the volume |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Snapshot removal tests\r\n\r\n| Test | Result |\r\n| --- | --- |\r\n| Delete snapshot 5 | Snapshot deleted and removed from storage |\r\n| Delete snapshot 1 | Snapshot deleted and not removed from storage |\r\n| Delete snapshots 2 and 3 | Snapshots deleted and removed from storage; furthermore, snapshot 1 was also removed from storage |\r\n\r\n### Template creation test\r\n\r\n| # | Test | Result |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | Create template from snapshot 4 and create a VM using the template | Template created correctly, VM had the files created in the original VM |\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tests with snapshot.backup.to.secondary = true\r\n\r\nAll tests performed in the previous sections were repeated with snapshot.backup.to.secondary = false, in addition, two additional tests were performed. For the tests in this section, a test VM was created and reused for all tests.\r\n\r\n### Snapshot creation tests\r\n\r\n| N | Test | Result |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| 1 | Migrate the VM + ROOT volume and take snapshot 6 | Migration carried out and full snapshot created |\r\n| 2 | Stop the VM, migrate the volume and take snapshot 7 | Volume migration performed and incremental snapshot

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the PowerFlex/ScaleIO SDC client connections, includes the following changes.\r\n\r\n- Added ScaleIOSDCManager to manage SDC connections, checks clients limit, prepare and unprepare SDC on the hosts.\r\n- Added commands for prepare and unprepare storage clients to prepare/start and stop SDC service respectively on the hosts.\r\n- Introduced config 'storage.pool.connected.clients.limit' at storage level for client limits, currently supported for Powerflex only.\r\n- Added custom stats support for storage pool, through listStoragePools API (when storagecustomstats=true). For Powerflex, it returns latest ConnectedSDCCount.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev

change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an

Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/22242548/bfa64b8e-2864-4f19-ba68-402b6ed8404d)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n**Environment with one domain (`dom`), besides `root`, and a domain admin and an user accounts in both `root` and `dom`, as well as the Root Admin. Every account created one project each.**\r\n\r\nTable lists all options shown in UI, when logged as each of the accounts:\r\n(User accounts did not show the selection fields Owner type, Domain and Account/Project.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/8108\r\n\r\nAs of now, on adding a new network tier to a VPC, results in a small network disruption because of keepalived's config reload on both the VRs. This patch fixes this by doing operations in this order:\r\n1. Stop keepalived on all the backup VRs. This prevents the backup VR from becoming master when keepalived on the PRIMARY VR is getting reloaded.\r\n2. Update the config and reload on all primary VRs.\r\n3.

Description\r\n\r\nThe VM deployment wizard only shows one of the disk offerings that will be used to create the VM's volumes, which corresponds to the data disk if using a template, and the root disk if using a ISO. The disk offering that will be used to create the root disk is not shown when deploying through a template. This confuses users, since the wizard does not explicitly show what offering will be used for each disk. Furthermore, the instance summary often presents an incorrect value for the size of the disks.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes some changes in the deployment wizard in order to explicitly show what offerings will be used for the root and data disks, and to display their correct size. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/25729641/ea6a1260-44ab-4aac-ac85-e9ad42231563)\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI created one disk offering:\r\n1. Name and description: Associated. Custom disk size: false. Disk size (in GB): 10.\r\n\r\nAnd two compute offerings:\r\n1. Name and description: Associated. Compute only disk offering: false: Disk offerings: Associated.\r\n2. Name and description: Custom. Compute only disk offering: false: Disk offerings: Custom Disk.\r\n\r\nIn every test described below, I deployed the VM and verified that the VM's volumes were created using the disk offerings and the sizes displayed in the UI.\r\n\r\n### Tests deploying from a template:\r\n\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance, enabled root disk offering override and selected Medium;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance, enabled root disk offering override, selected Custom and set the size to 10 GB;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Custom and set the size to 11 GB;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Custom, set the size to 12 GB, enabled override and selected Medium;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Associated;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Associated, enabled override and selected Medium;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Associated, enabled override, selected Custom and set the size to 13 GB;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance and a Small data disk;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance, enabled root disk override, selected Medium and a Small data disk;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance, enabled root disk override, selected the Custom root disk, set the size to 11 GB, selected the Custom Disk data disk and set the size to 12 GB.\r\n\r\n### Tests deploying from an ISO:\r\n\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance and Medium disk size;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Custom and Medium disk size;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Associated and Medium disk size;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Associated, Custom disk size and set the size to 13 GB.","created_at":"2024-06-13T13:23:29Z","updated_at":"2024-09-06T07:55:44Z","closed_at":"2024-07-12T13:13:47Z","merged_at":"2024-07-12T13:13:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"407990650f6202e1955bc29d956187d8b7c52ef3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":739374767,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzkzNzQ3Njc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:UI","name":"component:UI","color":"ea62a8","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/30","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/30/labels","id":9577330,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4AkiNy","number":30,"title":"4.20.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"rohityadavcloud","id":95203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud","html_url":"https://github.com/rohityadavcloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rohityadavcloud/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":245,"state":"closed","created_at":"2023-06-23T18:43:29Z","updated_at":"2024-12-05T09:42:31Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2024-11-27T14:52:35Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/d0f9dcd8c986c65886ded5ad2814332817168b60","head":{"label":"scclouds:show-root-disk-offering-in-vm-deployment","ref":"show-root-disk-offering-in-vm-deployment","sha":"d0f9dcd8c986c65886ded5ad2814332817168b60","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds/cloudstack","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nFixes: #7907\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue where two VMs can be assigned the same IP if they are created at the same time.\r\n`NetworkOrchestrator.allocateNic()` calls `guru.alocate()` which returns a free IP address.\r\n`NetworkOrchestrator.allocateNic()` then calls `_nicDao.persists()`\r\n\r\nBut `guru.allocate()` can return same IPs to two VMs if the first VM hasn't persisted the nic to the DB yet.\r\nDoing the whole thing in a transaction might be costly.\r\n\r\nSo the fix is to check if the IP returned by guru.allocate is already assigned just before persisting the NicVO in a transaction.\r\nCheck will be done only for cases where Ipv4 allocation might race. \r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an issue as part of #8946 \r\n\r\nThe issue I've observed is not while taking the snapshot but while creating the template from the snapshot (stack trace also refers the same).\r\n\r\nI could not reproduce the original issue of failed snapshot showing as backedup state rather than error (it might have already fixed after 4.17.2), but I saw another serious issue.\r\n\r\nThe issue is whenever a snapshot is used to create a template or volume and if there is failure in backing up the snapshot to the secondary store and as part of handling that failure MS is deleting the snapshot in primary storage itself.\r\n\r\nThese changes are introduced as part of the PR https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/5297\r\n\r\n1.

Create a template from that snapshot\r\n3. As part of the creation, MS first tries to backup the snapshot to the secondary storage\r\n4. One new entry in the snapshot_store_ref table will be seen for store_role \"Image\" in \"creating\" state\r\n5. Make the backup operation fail (I've played with the debugger to fail the operation)\r\n6. Observe the snapshot_store_ref table, this entry will be deleted and also keeps the existing entry for store_role \"Primary\" as \"Ready\" state. (Previously this row was marked as \"Destroyed\")","created_at":"2024-06-13T07:36:30Z","updated_at":"2024-09-04T06:45:40Z","closed_at":"2024-09-04T06:44:50Z","merged_at":"2024-09-04T06:44:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"601e9b67eadc139b52d2f1b204f6b56c2d18c9ac","assignee":{"login":"sureshanaparti","id":12028987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"sureshanaparti","id":12028987,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDI4OTg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12028987?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti","html_url":"https://github.com/sureshanaparti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sureshanaparti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vladimirpetrov","id":12384665,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzg0NjY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12384665?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov","html_url":"https://github.com/vladimirpetrov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vladimirpetrov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"shwstppr","id":153340,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzM0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr","html_url":"https://github.com/shwstppr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shwstppr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/milestone/33","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/milestones/33/labels","id":11200547,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAJTq2M4Aqugj","number":33,"title":"4.19.2","description":"minor

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a unit test failure in LibvirtConvertInstanceCommandWrapperTest.\r\n\r\nBefore this patch, `testGetUnmanagedInstanceDisks` calls the `getNfsStoragePoolHostAndPath` method which then calls `mount | grep null`. If the system running test has some mounts with the text `null` in them, the test fails.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by mocking the return value for `getNfsStoragePoolHostAndPath`.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nWhen executing many operations simultaneously with a public IP, some inconsistencies are being implemented in the environment, such as the duplicate public IP (Fixes: #8967).\r\n\r\nFor this reason, this PR adds a lock to most APIs that manipulate a public IP, preventing inconsistencies that may occur due to race conditions.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nAll tests were done following the same steps but using different APIs that create rules for the IP (`createLoadBalancerRule`, `createFirewallRule`, `createPortForwardingRule`, `createIpForwardingRule`):\r\n\r\n1. Associate a public IP with a network;\r\n2. Create a rule with one of the APIs;\r\n3. Disassociate the IP (before) and create a rule again (after) at the same time.\r\n\r\nTo test the `createRemoteAccessVpn` API, I created a firewall rule in step 2 and called the `createRemoteAccessVpn` API in step 3.\r\n\r\n**Before**: The `disassociateIpAddress` API threw an exception and still disassociated the IP from the VR. The APIs that kept the IP in the VR even after disassociation were `createLoadBalancerRule` and `createRemoteAccessVpn`.\r\n\r\n**Now**: All APIs that create rules for the IP wait for the `disassociateIpAddress` API to finish executing and only then begin execution, meaning that the exception is now thrown when creating the rule and no longer when disassociating the IP. No API held the IP in the VR.\r\n\r\nThe tests were made in high and low performance environments. The low performance environments were more susceptible to race conditions due to the time it takes to process a

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes some improvements to quota tariffs APIs and UI. Two parameters have been added to the `quotaTariffList` API: `id` and `listonlyremoved`. The first one refers to the tariff's ID, and the other to a flag that indicates whether only the removed tariffs will be listed. The `keyword` API parameter has also been changed in order to filter tariffs that contain a given keyword in their names.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a validation has been added to check if the calling user has access to the tariff's activation rules. They will have access if they have permission to create or update tariffs.\r\n\r\nThe quota tariff's UI has also been refactored. Now, more fields of the `quotaTariffList` response are displayed, and the operator can easily create, edit and filter tariffs.\r\n\r\nTo filter tariffs by usage type, the `listUsageType` API response has been refactored, adding the name of the usage type in uppercase letters, separated by underscores, such as `ALLOCATED_VM`. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement

Description\r\n\r\nDuring the creation of firewall rules, if one of the limits for the ports is not informed, it is saved in the database as Null, indicating that there is no starting/ending limit.\r\n\r\nwhile creating a Kubernetes cluster, if the selected network has a rule that contains ports saved as null, an error is thrown, stopping the execution of the process.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour has been fixed, making it so that any port saved as null is regarded as being being on its respective limit (1 for start ports and 65535 for end ports) during the creation of a Kubernetes cluster.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI created a rule in an existing network, with null starting port and ending on port 10, making it so it should not conflict with any of the ports required by the Kubernetes cluster. Before applying the changes, an error would be thrown.\r\n\r\nI repeated the process after applying the changes and the cluster was successfully created.","created_at":"2024-06-11T14:13:19Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T08:47:05Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c70ccccb322ada3e6fcdbc3a88ce5f6abc3c980","assignee":{"login":"kiranchavala","id":1401014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDEwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1401014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala","html_url":"https://github.com/kiranchavala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kiranchavala","id":1401014,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MDEwMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1401014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala","html_url":"https://github.com/kiranchavala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kiranchavala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":592559219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1OTI1NTkyMTk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:networking","name":"component:networking","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1700119912,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzAwMTE5OTEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kubernetes","name":"component:kubernetes","color":"0db7ed","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9223/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/9223/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/9223/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/f893bd4d1fcbde43eda455076ff07868c4a0ca11","head":{"label":"scclouds:fix_NPE_Kubernetes_cluster","ref":"fix_NPE_Kubernetes_cluster","sha":"f893bd4d1fcbde43eda455076ff07868c4a0ca11","user":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":377596111,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzc1OTYxMTE=","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"scclouds/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"scclouds","id":85898818,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg1ODk4ODE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85898818?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds","html_url":"https://github.com/scclouds","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scclouds/sub
