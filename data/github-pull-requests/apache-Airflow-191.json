commit adds the following things:\r\n\r\n- Add \"airflowVersion\" flag that will allow use to add some components\r\n\tthat are just available or work with certain Airflow version.\r\n\tExample: pod_template_file is available for Airflow >= 1.10.12\r\n- Update logic for selecting pre/post Airflow 2.0 CLI commands based\r\n\ton that flag\r\n- Updates stragtegy of Airflow Webserver based on that flag as the\r\n\twebserver in Airflow >= 2 does not need access to DAG files, hence\r\n\twe don't need to recreate but can have a \"true\" rollingUpdate\r\n- Allow overriding webserver udpate strategy\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

I add support for storing connections serialized as JSON instead of airflow connection URI.\r\n\r\n@mik-laj what do you think of this approach?\r\n\r\nI use subclass instead of configuration.\r\n\r\nAnd what I do about the extra field, which has that duality re str vs dict, is if it is dict I dump to str, and if str i leave it.\r\n\r\nThis is an alternative to your approach where user can store under node `extra_dejson` if they want to store as

added support for using odbc with MsSqlOperator\r\n\r\nThis PR maintains this support while ensuring that each provider is completely independent of the other.\r\n\r\nTo that end we make two changes here.\r\n\r\n## 1. Don't import `OdbcHook` in mssql sql operator module\r\n\r\nThis was  only done for type hinting and we can accomplish the same by hinting with `DBApiHook`\r\n\r\nAlthough unfortunately this does make it more hidden that `odbc` can be used with this operaotor.\r\n\r\n## 2. refine the ms sql operator test to not require odbc hook\r\n\r\nFor the MsSqlOperator, to verify compatibility with odbc hook, we can relax this test a bit.\r\n\r\nWe only need to verify that it will try to use the hook returned from `Connection.get_hook` if one is found, and `MsSqlHook` otherwise.\r\n\r\nThat's enough to verify that if the conn type is `odbc` then MsSqlOperator will use the odbc hook, and with this change, the two providers are completely independent.\r\n\r\nsee:

change improves the process of image preparation in DockerHub\r\nand manual version of it, in case the DockerHub automation does\r\nnot work. It introduces the following changes:\r\n\r\n* The \"nightly-master\" builds were failing because they tried\r\n  to prepare packages without the \"dev\" suffix (such packages\r\n  are skipped now in case package with the same version has\r\n  already been released). The \"dev\" suffix forces the packages\r\n  to be build.\r\n\r\n* VERBOSE_COMMAND variable is removed to get more readable output\r\n  of the script.\r\n\r\n* Image verification is now part of the process. The images are\r\n  automatically tested after they are built and the scripts\r\n  will not push the images if the images do not pass the\r\n  verification.\r\n\r\n* Documentation is updated for both RC and final image preparation\r\n  (Previous update did not update the RC image preparation)\r\n\r\n* Documentation is added to explain how to manually refresh the\r\n  images in DockerHub in case the nightly builds are not running\r\n  for a long time.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

using either `DataflowStartFlexTemplateOperator`, `DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator` or `DataflowStartSqlJobOperator`. The parameter `wait_until_finished` seems to have no effect which meant the default behavior is observed regardless of what is passed. First experienced this while using `DataflowStartFlexTemplateOperator` to trigger a job in streaming mode and the operator returned success when the job's state changed to running despite passing `wait_until_finished: True`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        If True, wait for the end of pipeline execution before exiting.\r\n        If False, only submits job.\r\n        If None, default behavior.\r\n        The default behavior depends on the type of pipeline:\r\n\r\n        * for the streaming pipeline, wait for jobs to start,\r\n        * for the batch pipeline, wait for the jobs to complete.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes that and passes `wait_until_finished` to the `_DataflowJobsController` wherever `jobs_controller.wait_for_done()` is called.\r\n\r\nalso noticed here:

AzureContainerInstanceHook was derived from AzureBaseHook\r\nand it did not add any new connection fields. Instead\r\nit duplicated the tennantId and subscriptionId extr behaviour,\r\nbut it never worked, because it duplicated the fields\r\nfrom the AzureBaseHook - and caused a lot of warnings when\r\nAzureProvider was added.\r\n\r\nThis change sets the default connection type for the\r\nAzureContainerInstanceHook to be azure_default and the\r\nconnection type to be 'azure'.\r\n\r\nThose defaults are much more 'sane'. The existing connections\r\nwill continue to work, only when you open them in the UI, they\r\nwill display the extras directly rather than in dedicated fields\r\nuntil the user changes the connection type to \"azure\" which will\r\nfix the display.\r\n\r\nSo no disruptions, just temporary UI/Editing glitch. No more warnings\r\nprinted when Azure provider is added.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

PIP 20.2.4 was so far the only officially supported installation\r\nmechanism for Airflow as there were some problems with conflicting\r\ndependencies (which were ignored by previous versio of PIP).\r\n\r\nThis change attempts to solve this by removing a [gcp] extra\r\nfrom `apache-beam` which turns out to be the major source of\r\nthe problem - as it contains requirements to the old version of\r\ngoogle client libraries (but apparently only used for tests).\r\n\r\nThe \"apache-beam\" provider migh however need the [gcp] extra\r\nfor other components so in order to not break the backwards\r\ncompatibility, another approach is used.\r\n\r\nInstead of adding [gcp] as extra in the apache-beam extra,\r\nthe apache.beam provider's [google] extra is extended with\r\n'apache-beam[gcp]' additional requirement so that whenever the\r\nprovider is installed, the apache-beam with [gcp] extra is installed\r\nas well.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

using `pod_template_file` or `full_pod_spec`, Pod identifying labels\r\nwere not applied to the POD which meant `reattach_on_restart` did not\r\nwork for them.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n\t\"dag_id\": \"dag\",\r\n\t\"kubernetes_pod_operator\": \"True\",\r\n\t\"task_id\": \"task\",\r\n\t\"try_number\": \"1\",\r\n\t\"airflow_version\": 2.0.2,\r\n\t\"execution_date\": \"2016-01-01T0100000100\",\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes that and makes the labels consistent whether users\r\nuse `pod_template_file`, `full_pod_spec` or just pass params to\r\nKubernetesPodOperator.\r\n\r\nThis also helps in cleaning up pod (using `airflow kubernetes cleanup-pods`) where we use labels to identify pods launched by the scheduler:

is the first part of me trying to improve Airflow's documentation to make it more consistent and understandable.\r\n\r\nThis takes the old, single-page Concepts document and turns it into a new Concepts section, rewrites some of the text to have consistent terminology (upstream/downstream, Task vs Operator, etc.) and tries to make it generally more accessible and high-level. It also moves a couple of other pages in that directly fit with the existing content (Scheduler and Smart Sensors).\r\n\r\nOnce this is in, I would then like to take on a high-level reorganisation of the other documents, grouping them a bit better (installation/deployment, tutorials, howto) and also making a better overall concept split between \"reference\" documentation (exhausive, technical details and important notes - not autogenerated API docs) and \"concept\" documentation (high-level design explanation).\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of what is currently in \"Concepts\" should _actually_ be in a \"Reference\" section, in my view, but I've kept the current grouping for now to make this PR even slightly approachable.","created_at":"2021-04-19T22:50:51Z","updated_at":"2021-04-29T20:20:13Z","closed_at":"2021-04-29T20:20:04Z","merged_at":"2021-04-29T20:20:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"df143aee8d9e7e0089b747bdd27addf63bb4962f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mik-laj","id":12058428,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDU4NDI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12058428?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj","html_url":"https://github.com/mik-laj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mik-laj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vikramkoka","id":25178089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTc4MDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25178089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka","html_url":"https://github.com/vikramkoka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vikramkoka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including
