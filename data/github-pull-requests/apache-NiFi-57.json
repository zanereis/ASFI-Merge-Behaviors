NIFI-7153 Limit Length of Component Properties (by limiting HTTP request sizes)\r\n\r\n_The code in this change-set adds a new ContentLengthFilter and introduces the DosFilter from the jetty project_\r\n\r\nThese changes effect every byte that passes thru the HTTP API and HTTP UI so this code needs thorough review and wide testing.\r\n\r\nThe `ContentLengthFilter` is new and currently activated via code in `JettyServer.java`.  I think the filter should be activated via the various web.xml files but my initial attempts at integrating that way were unsuccessful.  The current activation uses the default of 10MB for the limit on PUT/POST requests to all API and UI contexts.\r\n\r\nBefore completing the new filter, I attempted to use the `maxFormContentSize` setting to produce the limiting behavior.  Unfortunately, that value is only referenced during `application/x-form-encoded`-type requests, not our typical PUT with `application/json`.  This change-set includes a unit test that demonstrates this distinction.\r\n\r\nThere is a small change to the UI code to account for the `413` responses returned by the server.\r\n\r\nThe `DosFilter` is from the jetty project and activated via the `webdefaults.xml` file.  I've set reasonable defaults that allow me to use the application as a user and still trigger the DoS filter behavior with a benchmark (such as `wrk`).\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a new behavior introduced by the `ContentLengthFilter` class that will effect older, HTTP 1.0 and non-conforming HTTP user agents.  When a PUT or POST HTTP request is made without sending a `Content-Length` header, the server will now respond with `411 Length Required`.\r\n\r\nRemaining steps:\r\n - finalize activation point for both filters (xml vs code)\r\n - finalize defaults for both filters\r\n - apply options to specific contexts/endpoints as necessary\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nNot sure why this works in NiFi 1.8.0, as it appears to have been introduced by [NIFI-4504](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-4504)/4505 which went into NiFi 1.5.0. Regardless, the streams should be closed, and the memory leak described in NIFI-7114 should be fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\nIn addition to closing the streams, I also updated the code to use lambdas and removed a few warnings.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

- Adding CaptureChangePostgreSQL processor to capture data changes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) in PostgreSQL tables via Logical Replication. \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Davy Machado <machado.davy@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Gerdan Santos <gerdan@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nInspired on CaptureChangeMySQL, this processor can use PostgreSQL Streaming Replication Connection to allow access to their transactional logs and such, in order for external clients to have a \"change data capture\" (CDC) capability.\r\n\r\nThe processor don't accept incoming connections, must be run on the primary node as a single threaded processor, and generate flow files for operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in JSON format.\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-20T04:03:33Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T21:32:16Z","closed_at":"2022-01-24T21:32:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e15b23b5ad888cbeff25bb8470e1dafc49325aed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4065/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4065/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4065/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/57c3bc1fc194b35e5928b9ad2180f4566d9ed89d","head":{"label":"gerdansantos:NIFI-4239","ref":"NIFI-4239","sha":"57c3bc1fc194b35e5928b9ad2180f4566d9ed89d","user":{"login":"gerdansantos","id":16454427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDU0NDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16454427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos","html_url":"https://github.com/gerdansantos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":241768291,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDE3NjgyOTE=","name":"nifi","full_name":"gerdansantos/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gerdansantos","id":16454427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDU0NDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16454427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos","html_url":"https://github.com/gerdansantos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gerdansantos/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gerdansantos/nifi","description":"Mirror

This change could break PutKudu processors that are writing to Kudu timestamp (UNIXTIME_MICROS) columns via numeric fields.

Partitions in the constructor, it added the local partition as the first element in that list. This list should be ordered the same across all nodes in the cluster. By making the local partition the first in the array, each node had a different ordering of these partitions. As a result, Partition by Attribute strategy would constantly rebalance flowfiles that it received to other node, and Single Node always transferred data to the first partition, which was the local node, instead of whichever node should have been the first in the list. This commit addresses this issue by instead inserting the local partition intot he 'queuePartitions' array based on the local node identifier.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nUpdated JoltTransformJSON and JoltTransformRecord to be able to take the JOLT spec from a file location rather than having the body in the \"Jolt Specification\" property. The two properties are mutually exclusive, i.e. only one must be set (unless it's a Sort spec in which case both properties are ignored)\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nChanged calls from StandardProcessGroup.findAllConnections() to FlowManager.findAllConnections() when a FlowManager object is available. Some places work specifically on a ProcessGroup, I did not change those calls, only the no-arg calls. I also changed some stream() calls into foreach loops for added performance.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-30T18:42:51Z","updated_at":"2020-04-09T16:59:25Z","closed_at":"2020-04-09T16:59:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dddda752127f84ad3111a14ae56ed85ebd68c802","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"YolandaMDavis","id":1371858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzE4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1371858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis","html_url":"https://github.com/YolandaMDavis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/YolandaMDavis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4026/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4026/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4026/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/d691d65ba6d5d10ae42daf117b0b34aa4138ac58","head":{"label":"mattyb149:NIFI-7087","ref":"NIFI-7087","sha":"d691d65ba6d5d10ae42daf117b0b34aa4138ac58","user":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28576559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU3NjU1OQ==","name":"nifi","full_name":"mattyb149/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mattyb149","id":2124747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjQ3NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2124747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149","html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mattyb149/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mattyb149/nifi","description":"Mirror

For the purposes of this feature, the root process group (PG) is considered a PG just like any other child PG. It can be downloaded and replaced via import, same as any other child PG. \r\n2. When downloaded, Versioned Component IDs (VCIs) are generated from the PG component identifiers in a deterministic way and used as the IDs in the serialized result. This is identical to how PGs are saved to NiFi Registry. \r\n3. For any downloaded process group (PG), the PG component it was downloaded from is the origin PG. It will always be the origin, until it is deleted. The origin PG and all its descendants will never have VCIs present, but it retains the original IDs that the VCIs were generated from and can always re-generate them deterministically when comparing components on a future import. \r\n4. A downloaded PG can be imported anywhere else and this PG becomes an offspring of the origin. The offspring will have newly generated IDs, but will always have the VCIs from the download in it and will use them when comparing components on a future import. \r\n5. Pasting a copy of an origin or offspring PG generates new IDs for the new components and does not preserve VCIs. Thus, it is treated as a completely different PG since the VCIs it will generate on download are based on its new component IDs.\r\n6. Replacing a version controlled PG (or a PG with child components under version control) via import is not permitted.\r\n7. Downloading a PG currently under version control is allowed, but not recommended because its VCIs most likely were not generated from its IDs since version controlled components are often generated elsewhere and imported. Future uploads to this PG will be disallowed while it's under version control and stopping version control will clear all VCIs. Without VCIs, future imports will regenerate the VCIs from the component IDs and these will not match the VCIs from the download that occurred while the PG was version controlled. In this case, import is still allowed, however all queues will have to be empty because components are removed and re-added. \r\n \r\nChanges...\r\n- decoupled flow update request behavior from VersionsResource into new abstract FlowUpdateResource\r\n - added replace process group functionality in ProcessGroupResource\r\n - parameterized FlowUpdateResource and created entity hierarchies to allow for maximum code sharing across different update types\r\n - refactored flow update methods to make use of commonality across different update types whenever possible\r\n - fixed issues in

Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_If a scriptable processor (`InvokeScriptedProcessor`, `ExecuteScript`, or `ExecuteGroovyScript`) created a property descriptor and marked it as *sensitive*, then assigned a sensitive parameter to this property, on startup the application would fail and shutdown because the property descriptor sensitive state was not serialized to the `flow.xml.gz` file, as previously there was no such offering for a sensitive property descriptor that was not defined in the native processor. The startup now detects this scenario, prints a warning to the log, and treats the property descriptor as sensitive moving forward._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

-Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-26T23:46:08Z","updated_at":"2020-01-29T21:33:54Z","closed_at":"2020-01-29T21:33:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b38f7aefd803cca226351439c116309fd7c718c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mcgilman","id":123395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzM5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/123395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman","html_url":"https://github.com/mcgilman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mcgilman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"markap14","id":184268,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDI2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/184268?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14","html_url":"https://github.com/markap14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/markap14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"joewitt","id":3057465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNTc0NjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3057465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt","html_url":"https://github.com/joewitt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joewitt/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4017/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4017/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4017/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/c8acab4cbbed99bb5ab68b3b0687911275152808","head":{"label":"alopresto:NIFI-7012-squashed","ref":"NIFI-7012-squashed","sha":"c8acab4cbbed99bb5ab68b3b0687911275152808","user":{"login":"alopresto","id":798465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODQ2NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/798465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto","html_url":"https://github.com/alopresto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alopresto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdd two new properties to IdentifyMimeType (Config File and Config Body).\r\nSpecifying one of these properties will override the default NiFi MIME\r\ntype configuration and use the configured property's MIME config instead.\r\nAdd additional runtime documentation for IdentifyMimeType's usage. The\r\ndefault behavior of IdentifyMimeType is unchanged.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `master`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on both JDK 8 and JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-25T23:41:05Z","updated_at":"2020-02-07T00:35:03Z","closed_at":"2020-02-07T00:34:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"115ca52e979dcbb4eca56281206afae55bfa9d9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4016/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/4016/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/4016/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/b4cee4655dfabe7881d6d1997c6ec7e99eb2abb8","head":{"label":"trucemop:NIFI-2537","ref":"NIFI-2537","sha":"b4cee4655dfabe7881d6d1997c6ec7e99eb2abb8","user":{"login":"trucemop","id":3777579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3777579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop","html_url":"https://github.com/trucemop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":64078792,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NDA3ODc5Mg==","name":"nifi","full_name":"trucemop/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"trucemop","id":3777579,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Nzc1Nzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3777579?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop","html_url":"https://github.com/trucemop","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/trucemop/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/trucemop/nifi","description":"Mirror

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\nDescription of PR\r\n fixes bug NIFI-6968 Create Connection Model Allows Multiple Adds\r\n**Root Cause:** In the process of creation of connection, the add / apply button is not disabled , due to which, when the network is slow & when the button is clicked twice unknowingly, the requests are sent multiple times , so multiple connections are created.\r\n**Fix:** Disable the buttons when the add/update connection is in progress, enable them back after the action.\r\n**Impacted Areas:** the same issue in case of configuring connections & clicking on Update, also the cancel button should also be disabled when the creation or modification is in process\r\n**Tested in :** Add Connection, Update connection scenarios using the chrome's network throttling feature making the network very slow\r\n**After Fix:** the screenshots are taken during the progress, so they are disabled \r\nUpdate Connection -\r\n<img width=\"1439\" alt=\"update connection after fix\"

it possible to replace properties set in `nifi.properties` using environment variables when launching from Docker.\r\n\r\n`start.sh` replaces some properties defined in `nifi.properties` with a set of environment variables.\r\n\r\nThis adds some flexibility as the users are able to modify properties without touching the `nifi.properties` file but it can lead to some frustration when users think they can replace any property by defining an environment variable with the same name. Also, when users want to provide their own `nifi.properties` file as some properties will be overwritten.\r\n\r\nI believe we should only replace a property when there is an environment variable defined with the same name (we should use the same names that appear in the `nifi.properties` file in uppercase and replacing any `.` with `_`). Defaults should be taken from the `nifi.properties` file.\r\n\r\nThis way users can replace the properties file with a custom one, choose to define environment variables, or

in the SocketLoadBalancedFlowFileQueue. Even though the queue's setPriorities method was called, the underlying  may not have contained the localPartition. As a result, when setPriorities() was called, it did not properly delegate that call to . As a result, the queue knew that the Prioritizers were set but the local queue did not apply them. This happened due to a race condition between queue creation and NodeClusterCoordinator learning the Local Node Identifier. Additionally, updated NodeClusterCoordinator so that it will persist its state when it does learn the Local Node Identifier, as that was not being persisted. In testing this, also encounterd a deadlock in a particular Integration Test that was run, around AbstractFlowFileQueue and its synchronization. Because the 'synchronized' keyword synchronizes on 'this' and the concrete implementation also uses 'synchronized' and the result is the same 'this', a deadlock can occur that is difficult to understand. As a result, refactored AbstractFlowFileQueue to instead use read/write locks.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
