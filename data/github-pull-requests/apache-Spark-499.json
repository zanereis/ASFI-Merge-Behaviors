from JIRA, reported by @ash211\n\n\"Using the ADD_JARS environment variable with spark-shell used to add the jar to both the shell and the various workers. Now it only adds to the workers and importing a custom class in the shell is broken.\nThe workaround is to add custom jars to both ADD_JARS and SPARK_CLASSPATH.\nWe should fix ADD_JARS so it works properly again.\nSee various threads on the user list:\nhttps://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/incubator-spark-user/201402.mbox/%3CCAJbo4neMLiTrnm1XbyqomWmp0m+EUcg4yE-txuRGSVKOb5KLeA@mail.gmail.com%3E\n(another one that doesn't appear in the archives yet titled \"ADD_JARS not working on 0.9\")\"\n\nThe reason of this bug is two-folds\n\nin the current implementation of SparkILoop.scala, the settings.classpath is not set properly when the process() method is invoked\n\nthe weird behaviour of Scala 2.10, (I personally thought it is a bug)\n\nif we simply set value of a PathSettings object (like settings.classpath), the isDefault is not set to true (this is a flag showing if the variable is modified), so it makes the PathResolver loads the default CLASSPATH environment variable value to calculated the path (see https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/2.10.x/src/compiler/scala/tools/util/PathResolver.scala#L215)\n\nwhat we have to do is to manually make this flag set,

for Diana Carroll to report this issue (https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-1100)\n\nthe current saveAsTextFile/SequenceFile will overwrite the output directory silently if the directory already exists, this behaviour is not desirable because\n\noverwriting the data silently is not user-friendly\n\nif the partition number of two writing operation changed, then the output directory will contain the results generated by two runnings\n\nMy fix includes:\n\nadd some new APIs with a flag for users to define whether he/she wants to overwrite the directory:\nif the flag is set to true, then the output directory is deleted first and then written into the new data to prevent the output directory contains results from multiple rounds of running;\n\nif the flag is set to false, Spark will throw an exception if the output directory already exists\n\nchanged JavaAPI part\n\ndefault behaviour is overwriting\n\nTwo questions\n\nshould we deprecate the old APIs without such a flag?\n\nI noticed that Spark Streaming also called these APIs, I thought we don't need to change the related part in streaming?

main change is to add a configurable parameter spark.driver.maxretrynum which limits the retry times when the in-cluster driver program fails to start,\n\nin the current implementation, the in-cluster driver will fall into a dead loop when it fails to start unless the user kill it manually\n\nin DriverRunner.scala: keepTrying = supervise && exitCode != 0 && !killed\n\nWith this PR\n\nIn the worker, if the driver has tried for spark.driver.maxretrynum times and still failed to run, the master will receive the notification (DriverStateChanged)\n\nIf the driver state is ERROR or FAILED, and the driver still has chance to run on another worker (i.e. if the retry number hasn't been over the number of workers or configured maxretrynum), the driver will be relaunched to the other worker\n\nIn this implementation, the updated retry number of the driver is not written to the file by persistenceEngine (to avoid too many IO operations). Also the structure recording which workers the driver has been assigned to is also ignored by persistenceEngine\n\nThe description of the implementation:\n\nset two-level upper limit on retry number: master & worker, both of which are specified by spark.driver.maxRetry. The most obvious benefit of setting such a limit is to kill a failed driver earlier to save memory and cpu cores.\n\nmaster-side limit is in driverInfo.retriedcountOnMaster, which is a transient variable. worker-side limit is a local variable in DriverRunner\n\nin master-side, the default value of spark.driver.maxRetry is 0, in this case, the driver will be restarted in at most \"workers.size\" times, otherwise the driver will be restarted for MIN(maxRetry, workers.size) times; in worker-side, the default value of spark.driver.maxRetry is 0, in this case, the driver will be tried for ONLY ONCE (I changed the design to this because I think moving a driver to a new worker may have larger probability to run it successfully, e.g. some misconfigured env variable may be correct on other machines or memory may be larger there, etc.), otherwise, the driver will be restarted for maxRetry times\n\nDriverInfo will not be serialized to worker, i.e. returning back to the before-PR implementation of the relevant DeployMessages\n","created_at":"2014-02-26T23:58:51Z","updated_at":"2014-06-27T17:09:58Z","closed_at":"2014-04-05T22:53:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5728177a19f5f2a00a2d26844a3101b7eb198f97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/8/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/8/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/8/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/90a685aa082e7dc338f7b83dd67dadd262ac1204","head":{"label":"CodingCat:SPARK-1039","ref":"SPARK-1039","sha":"90a685aa082e7dc338f7b83dd67dadd262ac1204","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17228500,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIyODUwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"CodingCat/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat/spark","description":"Mirror

PR is for SPARK-979(https://spark-project.atlassian.net/browse/SPARK-979), where @rxin pointed out that the Spark Scheduler is very deterministic.\n\nthe main changes include\n\nAdd a LRUMap in util package (based on org.apache.commons.collections.map.LRUMap , its implementation is pretty neat, it implements LRU with a double linked list, and it does not need to really move data, but just changes the pointers)\n\nremove freeCores in CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.scala and save WorkerOffer in a LRUMap/HashMap(Configurable) to avoid new operation everytime\n\nchange the implementation of resourceOffers in TaskSchedulerImpl. Now it takes a Map as input and balances the load with LRU principle (LRU scheduling is configurable, if user does not want this feature (by default), then we will pass a HashMap to resourceOffers, otherwise, we will pass a LRUMap)\n\nFor clarification, in the code, I give an initial size 1000 to LRUMap, which will not impose the limitation on the max number of executors each application can use. I double checked the implementation of commons.collections, it turns out that when the map is full, the implementation will automatically double-size the original map until there are 1<<30 elements (in practice, we will not have so many executors to use)\n","created_at":"2014-02-26T23:45:36Z","updated_at":"2014-07-02T01:30:38Z","closed_at":"2014-03-01T19:26:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"650025c0d8e2a40a09c539b3d334a98458650141","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/7/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/7/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/7/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/402e318f9e01b95348158f4e3f1dbbb596fb6215","head":{"label":"CodingCat:SPARK-979","ref":"SPARK-979","sha":"402e318f9e01b95348158f4e3f1dbbb596fb6215","user":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17228500,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIyODUwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"CodingCat/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CodingCat","id":678008,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3ODAwOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/678008?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat","html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodingCat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CodingCat/spark","description":"Mirror
