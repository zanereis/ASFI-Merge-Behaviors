ops and test cases: prod, nansum and nanprod (see issue #3201)\r\n\r\nAdded test utility function for checking array equality (almost_equal_combo) because reldiff does not work well when all the elements of both arrays are close to zero. For global reductions of prod() the results are often in the order of ground truth = [1e-20], op output = [0]. For this case, reldiff gives a result of 1.0\r\n\r\nInstead, almost_equal_combo uses an element-wise threshold in addition to reldiff - if either of them indicate the op output is close to ground truth then the test passes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, almost_equal_combo ignores cells in *both* arrays if the corresponding cell in either array is NaN. This allows it to be used to verify the gradients of nansum and nanprod, where what we care about is getting the gradient of non-NaN inputs correct.","created_at":"2016-12-12T19:09:39Z","updated_at":"2016-12-20T20:56:31Z","closed_at":"2016-12-20T20:56:31Z","merged_at":"2016-12-20T20:56:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"871a4cb33f54c2008b23023297ed375a957b5fe0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/63894fb0ed708e81fb7d40b4085b6d656dbb515f","head":{"label":"alex-weaver:nnvm","ref":"nnvm","sha":"63894fb0ed708e81fb7d40b4085b6d656dbb515f","user":{"login":"alex-weaver","id":11133789,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTMzNzg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11133789?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver","html_url":"https://github.com/alex-weaver","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alex-weaver/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:nnvm","ref":"nnvm","sha":"16032a97401239c00b7e673cdeb2c0f802a342a3","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

As mentioned in #4003, we've finished the first step and now we can use TensorBoard without relying on TF, so I open this PR and please review the relevant code. Please check the coding style and relevant docs, anything is welcomed as it's my first time to join an open-source project.\r\n\r\nBefore I move to next step, build TensorBoard alone, I'll add a

create this PR to simplify others to continue working on it. But currently it is not ready for merging. \r\n\r\nThings are changed:\r\n\r\n1. docs/how_to/caffe.md for detailed instructions for caffe users to use mxnet\r\n2. added convert_caffe_modelzoo.py to download and convert caffe model zoo models\r\n3. added test_converter.py which tests the accuracy and speed all converted model \r\n\r\nIssues need to be fixed\r\n\r\n1. [ ] failed to convert bvlc_alexnet. \r\n2. [ ] failed to convert resnet due to the lack of Scale layer, related issues #3138 #1473\r\n3. [ ] does not support multiple inputs/outputs models\r\n4. [ ] i didn't test if using a mean.binaryproto for mean instead of a list of rgb mean, see resnet-50\r\n5. [ ] doesn't support PRelu #4139\r\n6. [ ] more code documents, such as we should add docstrings to each function https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/\r\n7. [ ] improve code quality in convert_symbol.py and convert_model.py. e.g remove `import caffe` because we can assume users will install protobuf first\r\n8. [ ] (optional)  if an operator is not supported, consider to use `sym.CaffeOp` instead of raise an exception  \r\n\r\nto reproduce 1 and 2, just change to `models = ['bvlc_alexnet', 'resnet-50']` in test_converter.py\r\n\r\nthe bottomline is we should get 1-5 fixed.

brings the CMake build closer to parity with the Makefile. \r\n\r\n- Enable MSHADOW_USE_SSE on MSVC. This is safe because /arch:SSE2 is [the default for x86 platforms on the lowest supported MSVC (2013)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7t5yh4fd(v=vs.120).aspx).\r\n- Enable MSHADOW_USE_SSE when -msse3 is valid on gcc. This protects SSE from being problematically enabled on non-x86 platforms.\r\n- Switch -msse2 to -msse3 on gcc/clang. There is no direct SSE3 support on MSVC; only SSE2 (by default) and AVX/2.\r\n\r\n**Note:** This has a side effect of assuming that we are never targeting ARM on MSVC-- if we wish to leave the door open for this target, we need to trap SSE behind an option flag or perform a test with the compiler as the Visual Studio generators don't offer a simple way to bind preprocessor defines to architectures. Please let me know if this is the case.","created_at":"2016-12-07T14:30:53Z","updated_at":"2017-03-15T18:35:14Z","closed_at":"2017-03-15T18:35:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b85f2d28031494bce92fb7551ada97913579c58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4141/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4141/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4141/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/3f8dcda3dbdac2f8eabe75e6a1fd6e2eb6a8aaca","head":{"label":"alextnewman:alextnewman-cmake-sse","ref":"alextnewman-cmake-sse","sha":"3f8dcda3dbdac2f8eabe75e6a1fd6e2eb6a8aaca","user":{"login":"alextnewman","id":9156833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTY4MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9156833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman","html_url":"https://github.com/alextnewman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50595394,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDU5NTM5NA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"alextnewman/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"alextnewman","id":9156833,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTY4MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9156833?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman","html_url":"https://github.com/alextnewman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alextnewman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/alextnewman/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

mxnet only checkpoint the model. In practice, the computation states are not only model but also states of the optimizer. For SGD with momentum enabled, momentum is the state of the SGD optimizer, and it saves something like `history of gradient`. So, when checkpointing, the states of optimizer should be saved as well.\r\n\r\nIf the optimizer state is not saved, when load a checkpoint and continue training, there will be a sharp decline for both training-accuracy and validation-accuracy.\r\n\r\nThis PR saves optimizer states when checkpointing.","created_at":"2016-12-06T22:43:05Z","updated_at":"2016-12-28T20:37:31Z","closed_at":"2016-12-28T20:37:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3812f00820bcfe0731ea897c3297115ddf3b4dfb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4124/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4124/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4124/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/8df19a31743e9a606eac36bc0b1fbdd6580f8c63","head":{"label":"intoraw:checkpoint_optimizer_states","ref":"checkpoint_optimizer_states","sha":"8df19a31743e9a606eac36bc0b1fbdd6580f8c63","user":{"login":"intoraw","id":1302872,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDI4NzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1302872?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw","html_url":"https://github.com/intoraw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/intoraw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f92ebf12156dec8ab5a8deafa3514ef42633b3f7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
