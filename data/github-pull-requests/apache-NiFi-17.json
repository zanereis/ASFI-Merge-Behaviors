The name of the attribute is used as header key. In addition to that it can read values from two sources i.e. attributes matching Regex and the headers present in `amq$headers` string. In case of key duplication in both sources, the precedence property decide which value will be used.\r\n\r\nAMQP attributes keys are now set as constants strings and reused where needed.\r\n\r\nAdded `onScheduled` to PublishAMQP and ConsumeAMQP to read all properties which don't change during running state.\r\n\r\nTest cases added for `PublishAMQP` headers source changes.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12451](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12451) Removes Bootstrap Notification Services deprecated under [NIFI-12450](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12450).\r\n\r\nBootstrap Notification capabilities are limited to email notification and HTTP requests for specific lifecycle operations. External monitoring tools provide more robust and flexible monitoring features, obviating the need for notification capabilities in the NiFi Bootstrap process.\r\n\r\nRemoving the Bootstrap Notification services removes a number of dependencies from the `lib/bootstrap` class path, providing the opportunity to streamline the `nifi-bootstrap` module. Additional changes include refactoring the automatic certificate generation to use `nifi-security-cert-builder` directly instead of the additional dependencies associated with `nifi-security-utils`. The refactored implementation also avoids any direct references to the `NiFiProperties` class. Removing the Bootstrap Notification Services also provides the opportunity for removing a number of commented properties from the default bootstrap.conf configuration.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-utils` module had an unnecessary dependency on JAXB 2, which ended up in the bootstrap class path. Removing this dependency highlighted the opportunity to remove use of JAXB 2 converters for Base64 and Hexadecimal in favor of standard JDK classes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12434](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12434) Upgrades NiFi Registry from Spring Framework 6.0.13 to 6.1.1 along with the following related dependencies:\r\n\r\n- Upgraded Spring Boot from 3.1.5 to 3.2.0\r\n- Upgraded Spring Security from 6.1.5 to 6.2.0\r\n- Upgraded Jetty from 11.0.18 to 12.0.3\r\n- Upgraded Servlet API from 5.0.0 to 6.0.0\r\n\r\nSpring Boot 3.2.0 supports Jetty 12, which depends on Servlet API 6. Jetty 12 moved Servlet API packages to new modules, and Spring Boot 3.2.0 defaults to the latest Jakarta EE 10 modules. This upgrade required several minor adjustments to package names for classes referencing Jetty components in Registry.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include streamlining several Registry integration tests to reduce the need for filtered component scanning related to Data Source configuration.\r\n\r\nFollowing on from the upgrade to Spring Framework 6, which included Flyway 9, additional updates include removing integration test configurations for MariaDB 10.0 and 10.2, which Flyway 9 no longer supports.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

This then allows to use ParseSyslog Processor/Reader to parse syslog.\r\n\r\nI added a ParsingStrategy in the parameters of ListenTCP. The default hasn't changed it still SPLIT_BY_DELIMITER. I added 3 other ParsingStrategy :\r\n* DISABLED : no parsing, split messages only when the connection closes\r\n* OCTET_COUNTING_STRICT : parse incomming data following strictly [OctetCounting](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6587#section-3.4.1) format.\r\n* OCTET_COUNTING_TOLERANT : prefer OctetCounting but switch to SPLIT_BY_DELIMITER if the OctetCounting frame is invalid.\r\n\r\nSince the defaults haven't changed should be retro compatible.\r\n\r\n\r\noctet counting ref: [RFC 6587 section

PR begins the process of re-implementing the UI using updated dependencies as described in the JIRA [1]. In doing so, it moves the UI away from markup generated on the server and allows for a better developer experience when building new capabilities. It is not intended to provide a drastically new experience for the user. The concepts and capabilities presented to the user are unchanged and the flow throughout the application is no different. With this PR in place however, we will be in a better position to make these sorts of changes in the future.\r\n\r\nIn its current state it is not ready to replace the existing UI as there are a number of features that are not implemented yet. Additionally, the efforts thus far have not prioritized the look and feel of various forms throughout the application and have instead focused on simple functionality.\r\n\r\nThe PR is being posted now due to an interest in collaboration with others in the community. Rather than trying to manage everything in a feature branch and keeping it up to date with current main, the new UI is being introduced alongside the current UI and behind a Maven profile which is not active by default. The new UI will not be available with the default build. However, if the build activates the `include-new-ui` profile the new UI will be built and included. On startup, NiFi has been updated to locate the new UI and if present deploy it to a new context path (`/nf`). If the new UI is not found, nothing is deployed to the new context path and the application functions as it does today.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note, when using the new UI running in NiFi at `/nf`, the user can log in and use the application. When logging out however, there is a hardcoded redirect that happens from the back end which sends the user to the old UI (`/nifi`).\r\n\r\nOnce the remaining features have been implemented, the look and feel has be polished, and it is ready for release a new PR will be posted that removes the old UI, updates the context path, and removes the Maven profile. At that point, the logout redirection issue called out above won’t be a problem anymore. I will create follow on JIRAs for all of these efforts.\r\n\r\nDevelopers can also run the new UI using `ng serve`. When accessing the UI in this manner, the login form does not work. There is some server side login request handling that does not work through the development server. Fortunately, an authenticated user does not need to log in. So to work around this, simply log in to NiFi using either UI running in the application first. The authentication token will be available in a cookie that is also available in the UI hosted by the development server.\r\n\r\nI’ve tried to structure the application in the following manner.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2023-11-20 at 9 29 48 AM](https://github.com/apache/nifi/assets/123395/67fbaf09-2769-4322-98fd-add11ddf2dd5)\r\n\r\nEach page has its own directory inside `pages`. Within each page, the primary content is in `feature`, any services for that page are in `service`, state management for the feature is in `state`, and any ui components referenced by the feature are in `ui`. The app root also contains `state`, `service`, and `ui` which are available for use by anything in any page. Pages, however, should not access anything from any other pages. I thought this directory structure would be sufficient but as new features are continually introduced with their own actions and state I suspect we may need further organization and refactoring.\r\n\r\nThe application leverages ngrx state management throughout. This includes actions and selectors for all data flow. One approach that may be considered unique is that all dialogs and routing happen as side effects to actions dispatched by components. This leaves components less cluttered and can focus on its purpose and not needing to deal with activated routes, dialog references, etc. It should make the components more testable as they only need to be provided with some data and then verify expected actions are dispatched. All specs at this point are bootstrapped with a mock store and selectors as needed to create successfully. More meaningful tests will be introduced as we continue working through the remaining items and finalize the UX.\r\n\r\nAs noted in the JIRA [1], even once the new canvas UI is in place there will still be other UIs in NiFi that will need updating. These include documentation, Custom UIs, Content Viewers, and error handling. These will continue to be used within the new canvas UI until they can also be migrated.\r\n\r\n[1]

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12392](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12392) Corrects NAR unpacking for additional component documentation contained in bundled JAR files. This change resolves a problem introduced in changes for [NIFI-12294](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12294), which resulted in additional details links not being rendered for applicable components.\r\n\r\nThe resolution corrects the filtering process used to find additional documentation for enumerated components contained in bundled JAR files within a given NAR. The filtering method depends on the presence of a `docs` path followed by the complete class name of the component being evaluated.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include new unit tests for the `NarUnpacker` to confirm the presence of additional details documentation extracted to the expected location.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12384](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12384) Upgrades NiFi Registry from Spring Framework 5 to 6.0.13 along with supporting libraries.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the changes involve replacing `javax` with `jakarta` in package names to align with major version changes in the Servlet API, JAX RS API, and related programming interfaces.\r\n\r\nRelated changes include upgrading the NiFi Toolkit CLI to the same JAX RS and Jersey versions as Registry to align with packaging requirements from shared dependencies.\r\n\r\nNiFi Registry changes include adjusting the Spring Security configuration to align with Spring Security 6, and removing the test Jetty Server Customizer that is no longer required for integration tests.\r\n\r\nThese changes are scoped to NiFi Registry using properties in the `nifi-registry` root module, leaving the remaining of the repository on the earlier versions of these libraries.\r\n\r\nUpgraded libraries for Registry include the following:\r\n\r\n- Upgraded Spring from 5.3.30 to 6.0.13\r\n- Upgraded Spring Boot from 2.7.16 to 3.1.5\r\n- Upgraded Spring Security from 5.8.7 to 6.1.5\r\n- Upgraded Jetty from 10.0.18 to 11.0.18\r\n- Upgraded Servlet API from 3.1.0 to 5.0.0\r\n- Upgraded JAX-RS from 2.1.1 to 3.1.0\r\n- Upgraded Jersey from 2.41 to 3.1.3\r\n- Upgraded JAXB from 2.3.2 to 4.0.4\r\n- Upgraded Java Validation from 2.0.1 to 3.0.2\r\n- Upgraded Flyway from 8.5.13 to 9.22.3\r\n- Upgraded ASM from 9.3 to 9.6 for Java 21\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-12370](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-12370) Corrects the behavior of the `DistributedMapCacheClientService` to close the supporting Netty thread pool when disabling the Controller Service.\r\n\r\nThe resolution moves the creation of the Netty `NioEventLoopGroup` from the Channel Pool Factory to the calling `DistributedCacheClient` so that the `closeChannelPool()` method can close both the `ChannelPool` and the `EventLoopGroup`.\r\n\r\nThis correction can be verified using the `DistributedMapCacheClientService` and the `DistributedMapCacheServer` together with the `PutDistributedMapCache` Processor. It is necessary to run the Processor at least once to create new threads. The presence of created threads can be verified using `jconsole` or a thread dump. After stopping the Processor and disabling the `DistributedMapCacheClientService`, the threads are no longer present in the JVM.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps
