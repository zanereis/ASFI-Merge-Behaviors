href=\"https://github.com/reactor/reactor-core/releases\">io.projectreactor:reactor-core's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v3.6.0</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Reactor-Core 3.6.0 is part of 2023.0.0 Release Train.</p>\n<p>This is the first GA release of 2023.0.0 🎉</p>\n<p>This note focuses on 3.6.0 proper, curating changes from across all milestones and also includes changes already released as part of 3.4.x line up to 3.4.34 as well as 3.5.x line up to 3.5.12.</p>\n<p>While there are plenty of improvements and bug fixes, it's worth to highlight the bigger themes first:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>Schedulers.boundedElastic()</code> may return a specific implementation tailored for <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/projects/loom/\">Project Loom</a> and running on virtual threads if application runs in Java 21+ runtime and have set the <code>reactor.schedulers.defaultBoundedElasticOnVirtualThreads</code> system property to <code>true</code>. Please consult the <a href=\"https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/snapshot/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html#boundedElastic--\">javadocs</a> and <a href=\"https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/snapshot/reference/#schedulers\">the reference documentation</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>Support for <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/238\">Multi-Release Jar</a>. Since this release project has java version specific sources that are enabled if runs in specific Java runtime. This allows to avoid unnecessary reflection checks as well as embrace some new neat java features without changing the baseline for the whole code base.</li>\n<li>Hardening of the context-propagation. This release introduces better support for external <code>Publisher</code>s detection with their corresponding decoration if detected. This enables more stable context-propagation when it comes to external libraries integration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See dedicated pre-release <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2023/10/31/what-new-is-coming-in-reactor-core-3-6-0#virtual-threads-support\">blogpost</a> for more information.</p>\n<h2>What's Changed</h2>\n<h3>:warning: Update

Please consult the <a href=\"https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/snapshot/api/reactor/core/scheduler/Schedulers.html#boundedElastic--\">javadocs</a> and <a href=\"https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/snapshot/reference/#schedulers\">the reference documentation</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>Support for <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/238\">Multi-Release Jar</a>. Since this release project has java version specific sources that are enabled if runs in specific Java runtime. This allows to avoid unnecessary reflection checks as well as embrace some new neat java features without changing the baseline for the whole code base.</li>\n<li>Hardening of the context-propagation. This release introduces better support for external <code>Publisher</code>s detection with their corresponding decoration if detected. This enables more stable context-propagation when it comes to external libraries integration.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See dedicated pre-release <a

Description\r\nFixed the flaky test `extendedXmlJavaTypeAdapter` and `simpleXmlJavaTypeAdapter`  inside `JAXBUtilsTest.java` class. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/b608027f5f352affd3d2228ae4733b47049f2590/rt/frontend/jaxrs/src/test/java/org/apache/cxf/jaxrs/utils/JAXBUtilsTest.java#L38\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/b608027f5f352affd3d2228ae4733b47049f2590/rt/frontend/jaxrs/src/test/java/org/apache/cxf/jaxrs/utils/JAXBUtilsTest.java#L43\r\n\r\n#### Root Cause\r\nThe tests `extendedXmlJavaTypeAdapter` and `simpleXmlJavaTypeAdapter` have been reported flaky when run with the [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool. The tests failed due to the non-deterministic ordering of fields returned by getDeclaredFields(). The getDeclaredFields() method returns an array of Field objects representing all the fields declared by a class or interface. In the above tests, it returned two values: one a private field named birthDate of type `java.time.LocalDate` and the other `org.apache.cxf.jaxrs.utils.JAXBUtilsTest$CustomerDetailsWithExtendedAdapter.this$0`. The second value represents a synthetic field generated by the Java compiler for the inner class CustomerDetailsWithExtendedAdapter. When an inner class accesses members of its enclosing class, Java creates a synthetic field (in this case, this$0) as a reference to the outer class (JAXBUtilsTest) which is not useful for the test.\r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nTo ensure the tests are not flaky due to the non-deterministic ordering of fields returned by getDeclaredFields(), we introduced a condition to filter out the fields(synthetic and final fields) that are not useful for the testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How this has been tested?\r\n\r\n**Java:** openjdk version \"17.0.8\"\r\n**Maven:** Apache Maven 3.6.3\r\n\r\n1) **Module build**

href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases\">com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java 6.0.11</h2>\n<p>We have just released version 6.0.11 of the <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk\">UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</a>. It is available for download from <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/files/\">SourceForge</a>, and it is available in the <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.unboundid/unboundid-ldapsdk/6.0.11\">Maven Central Repository</a>.</p>\n<p>Note that this is the last release of the LDAP SDK that will offer support for Java 7. As of the next release (which is expected to have a version of 7.0.0), the LDAP SDK will only support Java 8 and later.</p>\n<p>You can find the release notes for the 6.0.11 release (and all previous versions) at <a href=\"https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html\">https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html</a>, but here’s a summary of the changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the <code>ldapsearch</code> and <code>ldapmodify</code> command-line tools to provide better validation for the <code>--proxyAs</code> argument, which includes the proxied authorization v2 request control in the requests that they issue. Previously, they would accept any string as the authorization ID value, but they will verify that it is a valid authorization ID using the form “dn:” followed by a valid DN or “u:” followed by a username.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the <code>Filter</code> class so that the methods used to create substring filters are more user-friendly when the filter doesn’t contain all types of components. Previously, it expected a substring component to be null if that component wasn’t to be included in the request, and it would create an invalid filter if the component was provided as an empty string. It will now treat components provided as empty strings as if they had been null.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the logic that the LDAP SDK uses to pare entries down to a specified set of attributes (including in the in-memory directory server and the <code>ldifsearch</code> command-line tool) to improve its behavior if it encounters an entry with a malformed attribute description (for example, one that contains characters that aren’t allowed). Previously, this would result in an internal error, but it will now make a best-attempt effort to handle the invalid name.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the <code>TimestampArgument</code> class to allow it to accept timestamps in the ISO 8601 format described in RFC 3339 (e.g., 2023-11-30T01:02:03.456Z). Previously, it only accepted timestamps in the generalized time format (or a generalized time representation that didn’t include any time zone information, which was treated as the system’s local time zone).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the <code>JSONBuffer</code> class to add an <code>appendField</code> method that can be used to append a generic field without knowing the value type. Previously, it only allowed you to append fields if you knew the type of the value.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added new <code>BinarySizeUnit</code> and <code>DecimalSizeUnit</code> enums that can be used when dealing with a quantity of data, like the size of a file or the amount of information transferred over a network. Each of the enums supports a variety of units (bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, petabytes, exabytes, zettabytes, and yottabytes), but the <code>BinarySizeUnit</code> variant assumes that each subsequent unit is 1024 times greater than the previous (e.g., one kilobyte is treated as 1024 bytes), while <code>DecimalSizeUnit</code> assumes that each subsequent unit is 1000 times greater than the previous (e.g., one kilobyte is treated as 1000 bytes).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the client-side support for invoking the LDIF export administrative task in the Ping Identity Directory Server to include support for activating one or more post-LDIF-export task processors, which can be used to perform additional processing after the data is successfully exported.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/blob/master/docs/release-notes.html\">com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>          &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>${TARGET=&quot;offline&quot;}                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LDAP SDK Home Page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n${TARGET=&quot;offline&quot;}                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Product Information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<pre><code>          &lt;h2&gt;Release Notes&lt;/h2&gt;\n<pre><code>      &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Version 6.0.11&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;\n\n      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n        The following changes were made between the 6.0.10 and 6.0.11 releases:\n      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n      &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Note that this is the last release that will support Java 7.  The next release\n          (expected to have a version number of 7.0.0) will only support Java 8 and later.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Updated the ldapsearch and ldapmodify command-line tools to provide better\n          validation for the value of the --proxyAs argument.  The tools will now reject\n          attempts to use the argument with a value that doesn't start with either &amp;quot;dn:&amp;quot; or\n          &amp;quot;u:&amp;quot;, and they will also reject attempts to use a value that starts with &amp;quot;dn:&amp;quot;\n          but is not followed by a valid LDAP DN.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Updated the Filter methods for creating substring filters to better support empty\n          components.  In LDAP filters, filters are transmitted using a binary encoding,\n          and substring components may be absent but not empty.  However, because\n          developers creating LDAP-enabled applications are more likely to be familiar with\n          the string representations of filters, it is understandable if someone were to\n          try to provide an empty string instead of null to indicate that the component is\n          not needed.  The methods for creating substring filters will now interpret empty\n          components as equivalent to being null, causing them to be omitted from the\n          resulting encoded LDAP filter.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Updated the logic that the LDAP SDK uses in the in-memory directory server and\n          the ldifsearch tool to pare matching entries based on a set of requested\n          attributes in the in-memory.  If an entry included an attribute with an invalid\n          name, then the logic used to parse an attribute description into the base\n          attribute type name and a set of attribute options would result in a null pointer\n          exception.  It now uses more lenient logic for parsing attribute descriptions,\n</code></pre>\n<p></code></pre></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

the order dependent flaky test in AttachmentUtilTest.java in core module.\r\n\r\n**Root Cause**\r\n\r\nThe polluter that caused the flakiness in `AttachmentUtilTest.java` was the test class `CachedOutputStreamTest.java`. In `AttachmentUtilTest`, there were multiple tests that used Mockito.spy() to verify the behavior of `CachedOutputStream` object. In those tests, the spy `CachedOutputStream` object \"cos\" was generated (`CachedOutputStream cos = spy(CachedOutputStream.class`). Then after this, there was a line `verify(cos).setThreshold(102400L)`. Therefore, after the cos being initialized, we need to make sure the setThreshold has been called once. However, it doesn't execute as expected, and the root cause is that \r\n1. the threshold is not provided when calling `testSetStreamedAttachmentProperties()` method -> so the setThreshold() won't be called in line 198 in AttachmentUtil.java and \r\n2. the `thresholdSysPropSet` (the boolean that indicated whether the default threshold has been set or not) has been set to true when we run the `CachedOutputStreamTest.java`. Inside the `CachedOutputStreamTest.java`, the unit test `testUseSysPropsWithAttachmentDeserializer()` called the `AttachmentUtil.setStreamedAttachmentProperties(message, cache`), so the `thresholdSysPropSet`has been set to true then. -> so the etThreshold(AttachmentDeserializer.THRESHOLD) won't be called in  line 215 in  AttachmentUtil.java.\r\n\r\nSince none of them being called, the verify(cos).setThreshold(102400L) will complained that setThreshold() was not invoked.\r\n\r\n Therefore, if we run `CachedOutputStreamTest.java` before running the `AttachmentUtilTest.java`, the `verify(cos).setThreshold(102400L)` statement will lead to the error message \r\n```\r\nWanted but not invoked:\r\ncachedOutputStream.setThreshold(102400L);\r\n-> at org.apache.cxf.attachment.AttachmentUtilTest.bigIntAsAttachmentMaxSize(AttachmentUtilTest.java:279)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fix log**\r\n\r\nAfter debugging the code, it is clear that the `thresholdSysPropSet` should be `False` every time the CachedOutputStream object was initialized. Therefore, I add the method `resetDefaultThreshold()` in the `CachedOutputStream.java`. In the test class `AttachmentUtilTest`, I called this reset method after initializing the new CachedOutputStream(). After this fix, the failure has been solved. \r\n\r\n**How this has been tested**\r\n\r\nJava: openjdk version \"17.0.8.1\"\r\nMaven: Apache Maven 3.9.5\r\n\r\n**How to reproduce the failure**\r\n`mvn install -pl core -am -DskipTests`\r\n(must setup iDFlakies on a Maven project - https://github.com/UT-SE-Research/iDFlakies)\r\n`mvn -pl core idflakies:detect -Ddetector.detector_type=random-class-method -Ddt.randomize.rounds=10 -Ddt.detector.original_order.all_must_pass=false`\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-17T22:27:06Z","updated_at":"2023-11-19T22:01:07Z","closed_at":"2023-11-19T22:00:36Z","merged_at":"2023-11-19T22:00:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"fa9d1239c6a6f04a9b1261f94c2e241e68e28839","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/pulls/1528/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/pulls/1528/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/issues/1528/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cxf/statuses/665f7d1e480cbcd40fcc087983290575fa6f0678","head":{"label":"yijut2:CXF-8959","ref":"CXF-8959","sha":"665f7d1e480cbcd40fcc087983290575fa6f0678","user":{"login":"yijut2","id":52221089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjIxMDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52221089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2","html_url":"https://github.com/yijut2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":719800040,"node_id":"R_kgDOKudG6A","name":"cxf","full_name":"yijut2/cxf","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yijut2","id":52221089,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMjIxMDg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52221089?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2","html_url":"https://github.com/yijut2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yijut2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yijut2/cxf","description":"Apache

Description\r\nFixed the flaky test `testGetWsdl` inside `NettyServerTest.java` class. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/3048785bf03baf76750f448777dfb003b5b1c98e/rt/transports/http-netty/netty-server/src/test/java/org/apache/cxf/transport/http/netty/server/integration/NettyServerTest.java#L86\r\n\r\n#### Root Cause\r\nThe test `testGetWsdl` has been reported as flaky when run with the [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool. The test failed because it is trying to find if a certain element(`<service name\"SOAPService\">`) is present inside the XML file which is returned by calling WSDL service. But there is slight change in the content of XML returned by the service. For example, in some cases the XML returned contained elements with `:wsdl` prefix. So instead of `<service name\"SOAPService\">` , the XML content contained `<wsdl:service name\"SOAPService\">`. As a result the test is failed.\r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nAfter debugging the code, it is clear that XML content with `wsdl:` prefix, means that the elements are qualified by the namespace, and when you see the same tags without the prefix, the XML is still using the WSDL namespace, but it's defined as the default namespace, so the prefix is not necessary. So, the test is fixed by adding a condition to check if the element with `wsdl:` is present.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How this has been tested?\r\n\r\n**Java:** openjdk version \"11.0.20.1\"\r\n**Maven:** Apache Maven 3.6.3\r\n\r\n1) **Module build** - Successful\r\nCommand used - \r\n```\r\nmvn install -pl core -am -DskipTests\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) **Regular test**  - Successful\r\nCommand used - \r\n```\r\nmvn -pl core test -Dtest=org.apache.cxf.transport.http.netty.server.integration.NettyServerTest#testGetWsdl\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) **NonDex test**  - Failed\r\nCommand used - \r\n```\r\nmvn -pl rt/transports/http-netty/netty-server edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7-SNAPSHOT:nondex

Description\r\nFixed the flaky tests named `testDeserialization` inside `SerializationTest.java` and `AttributeTest.java` classes. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/3048785bf03baf76750f448777dfb003b5b1c98e/rt/javascript/javascript-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/cxf/javascript/types/SerializationTest.java#L91\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/3048785bf03baf76750f448777dfb003b5b1c98e/rt/javascript/javascript-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/cxf/javascript/types/AttributeTest.java#L73\r\n\r\n#### Root Cause\r\nThe test `testDeserialization` has been reported as flaky when run with the [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool. The tests failed because of the serialization of Testbean and AttributeTestBean classes, where the order of elements in the serialized XML changes between runs. The contents of the serialized strings do not remain constant and hence the tests are failing.  \r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nTo define a specific order for the XML elements when the classes TestBean1 and AttributeTestBean are serialized, we need to add the propOrder attribute to the @XmlType annotation. This attribute explicitly specifies the order in which fields should be serialized.\r\n\r\n### How this has been tested?\r\n\r\n**Java:** openjdk version \"11.0.20.1\"\r\n**Maven:** Apache Maven

Description\r\nFixed the flaky test `testGetFiles` inside `FileUtilsTest.java` class. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cxf/blob/8b205c8086aeb1f5514472f0802c1fb7d510a50e/core/src/test/java/org/apache/cxf/helpers/FileUtilsTest.java#L70\r\n\r\n#### Root Cause\r\nThe test `testGetFiles` has been reported as flaky when run with the [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool. The test failed because it is trying to compare contents in two lists, but since the order is not maintained in lists the assert is failing. The List in Java is implemented in such a way that it does not store the order in which the values are inserted. As a result, when both the lists are compared, it caused the failure. \r\n\r\n#### Fix\r\nThis test is fixed by first sorting the two lists and then comparing both lists.\r\n\r\n### How this has been tested?\r\n\r\n**Java:** openjdk version \"11.0.20.1\"\r\n**Maven:** Apache Maven 3.6.3\r\n\r\n1) **Module build** - Successful\r\nCommand used - \r\n```\r\nmvn install -pl core -am
