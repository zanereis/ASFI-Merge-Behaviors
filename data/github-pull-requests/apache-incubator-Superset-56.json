change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nHorizontal filter bar resizing appears to be affected by [this issue](https://github.com/httptoolkit/react-reverse-portal/issues/22) related to reverse portals: when an `<OutPortal />` is preceded by an element that is conditionally present or otherwise dynamic, React can crash.  In this situation, opening the dropdown then attempting to resize down causes this crash.  This PR follows the advice [here](https://github.com/httptoolkit/react-reverse-portal/issues/22#issuecomment-1068135379) and adds an empty text node before each `<OutPortal />` and wraps the two elements in a fragment.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/204937655-f5e74f2e-d127-4492-ad7e-5b5666f00210.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/204937670-c6cf3052-74da-4505-b8d9-fa2fd1febdf9.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR tightens up some styles:\r\n- There is no longer double divider lines when a divider is the first item in the horizontal filter bar.\r\n- The initial divider line and the other divider lines in the horizontal filter bar are now the same height.\r\n- Text spacing in the overflow menu is now more uniform.\r\n- The \"Filters out of scope\" item in horizontal overflow no longer has unbalanced top/bottom margin when it's the only item.\r\n- \"Filters out of scope\" in horizontal overflow contents are now more consistently spaced.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"594\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-30 at 4 24 02 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adjusts native filter components for horizontal filter bar.\r\nNoteworthy changes:\r\n1. Value filter:\r\n   a) Introduce a `oneLine` mode to Select component - if enabled, only 1 tag will be displayed at once and the rest of selected tags will be collapsed to an overflow tag. When user opens the dropdown, only the overflow tag is displayed. All tags are always displayed in a single line.\r\n   b) If tag is truncated, display a tooltip with full name\r\n   c) Customize `maxTagPlaceholder`, so that the overflow tag doesn't display 3 dots at the end, which takes precious space \r\n       (e.g. instead of the default `+ 1 ...` we show `+1` when 1 item is overflowing)\r\n3. Range filter:\r\n   a) Adjust the top and bottom margin to make sure that the slider is centered in horizontal mode\r\n   b) Decrease font weight and line height so that the marks fit well in the horizontal filter bar\r\n4. Time range filter: add styling to make sure that the pill is centered in horizontal mode\r\n\r\nKnown issues:\r\n1. The time range pill's width is dynamic depending on selected time range (\"No filter\" pill is smaller than \"2022-01-01 : 2022-12-01\" pill). However, the filter component itself always has a fixed width, which means that if the pill is short, there might be some empty space between the time range filter and the filter next to it. We are planning to replace it soon with a new component, stay tuned!\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-11-30 at 14 49 21\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/204815039-5b059801-4ec0-4f9b-ba79-46ae40603a38.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Enable `HORIZONTAL_FILTER_BAR` ff\r\n3. Set horizontal mode for the native filters bar\r\n5. Add various types of filters\r\n6.

SUMMARY\r\nRemove the following fields from `buildQueryObject`, as they raise annoying deprecation warnings on `/api/v1/chart/data` (these are also updated in the relevant chart plugins):\r\n- `limit` -> replace with `series_limit`\r\n- `timeseries_limit_metric` -> replace with `series_limit_metric`\r\n\r\nAlso fix the incorrect type of `series_limit_metric`, also fixing the `normalizeSeriesLimitMetric` function which was incorrect due to the incorrect type, and replace some `groupby` props with `columns` in some native filters that were also raising warnings. Finally add some missing tests that caught my eye.\r\n\r\nFunctionally this PR shouldn't change anything, as these fields are already converted into their non-deprecated counterparts here: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/4657250bcf3399cfe54615249ec8f55149dcbc18/superset/common/query_object.py#L65-L70 , so it should be minimal risk.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe horizontal filter bar for native filters isn't currently fully hidden behind the `HORIZONTAL_FILTER_BAR` feature flag: the flag currently only controls whether the gear icon is shown in vertical mode.  As such, if you enable the FF, change a dashboard's filter bar to horizontal, then disable the FF, the bar stays horizontal.

SUMMARY\r\nNo sources are added when importing zip files on Windows, as file paths are parsed using `pathlib.PureWindowsPath`. Schemas are defined using prefixes with trailing slashes, therefore file paths in zipfiles should instead be treated as `pathlib.PurePosixPath`s.\r\n\r\nAlthough Superset does not have official Windows support, this change fixes imports without changing the behaviour on Unix, since instantiating `pathlib.Path` creates a `pathlib.PurePosixPath`.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nImport

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR implements the following polishes:\r\n- Pagination on the table should be 25 by default (previously set to 10)\r\n-  Align refresh buttons in the left panel\r\n-  Align width of selected tables in left panel with search input\r\n    - The width was only wrong when there was no scrollbar present. I implemented a function to detect if a scrollbar is present and apply padding only if there is no scrollbar\r\n-  Remove save button and `...` dropdown menu from the top right of the header\r\n    - An `editing` prop was added in the header component so that it can be reused when building the edit dataset component\r\n- Brought the \"Manage your databases here\" blank state from SQL lab to the left panel\r\n- Fixed a bug where the table wouldn't take the full height of the dataset panel when there is no \"This table already has a dataset\" banner at the top\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### BEFORE:\r\n<img width=\"1189\" alt=\"createDSbefore\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/204584095-c895da39-a00b-41a1-8fa7-b4f45ec1e4e2.png\">\r\n\r\n#### AFTER:\r\n<img width=\"1189\" alt=\"1234createDSpolish\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/204584222-75cfe0a0-dda9-4c0b-a19f-18294649794d.png\">\r\n\r\n![5datasetDBselectorBlankState](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/204584253-f5b1fa5d-3ac9-4782-a4f3-0de38992d6ac.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, non-overflowed horizontal native filter dividers follow the following truncation logic:\r\n- If the divider title is truncated or there is a divider description set or both, the description icon is visible\r\n- Hovering over the description icon will show one or both of the following:\r\n  - The full title in bold, if the title is truncated\r\n  - The description if present\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies that behavior to the following:\r\n- If the divider title is truncated, hovering over the title will show the full title in standard font weight\r\n- If and only if there is a divider description set, the description icon will be visible and hovering over it will show the full description\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds a downgrade migration that removes `filter_bar_orientation` field from dashboard's `json_metadata`.\r\nIt's related to the horizontal filter bar feature that's currently in development and is locked behind a `HORIZONTAL_FILTER_BAR` feature flag.\r\nIt's a required cleanup step when downgrading Superset version, because the horizontal filter bar project adds `filter_bar_orientation` field to `DashboardJSONMetadataSchema` schema.\r\nUpgrade is not required - we simply default to `VERTICAL` if `filter_bar_orientation` is not present\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the generic chart axes feature flag is enabled, temporal filters can only be applied on numeric target columns, causing problems for databases such as Druid which stores temporal values in `LONG` format. To fix this, we should short circuit the `handle_single_value` inner function in the `filter_values_handler` of the `BaseDatasource` class and return the filter value as-is, as that should always be passed to the `get_since_until_from_time_range` in it's original format [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/22fab5e58ce574e962518067d982e3036449e580/superset/connectors/sqla/models.py#L1513-L1517).\r\n\r\nAs a follow-up, we should clean up these helper functions and add proper unit tests to them (adding unit tests in the current state of this code is fairly difficult).\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nAfter this fix, the temporal adhoc filter applies cleanly to a non-temporal column, similarly to how id does when disabling the \"GENERIC_CHART_AXES\" feature flag:\r\n<img width=\"882\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/204217555-2c470553-85a1-4fcb-a80b-947e126c17d8.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nCurrently the chart is unable to render, returning a \"Must specify a value for filters with comparison operators\" error:\r\n<img width=\"877\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/204217342-879e94f9-e52b-4e67-b56a-1cf9b29a61c9.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Gnable \"GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature flag.\r\n2. Go to \"Video Game Sales\" dashboard and edit the \"Most Dominant Platforms\" chart.\r\n3. See an error. Set the time filter to \"100 years ago\" to see that the query generates a relevant filter after the fix has been applied.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with

SUMMARY\r\nThe original goal of this PR is that the `XAxisSortControl` should be moved into `shared-controls` modules(refer to [PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21993)). So, do a refactor in this part.\r\n\r\n- Remove unused file in shared-module: `legacySortBy.tsx`\r\n- The `shared-controls` is declared as a module and creates a `index.ts` in it.\r\n- Use [Named-import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#named_import) instead of [Default-import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#default_import) when performing the import statement on the `shared-controls`.\r\n- Rename the `emitFilterControl.ts` to the `customControls.ts`, the goal is that this file should contain more custom controls in the future.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/a\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nIn some scenarios, editing dataset and then running chart query might lead to an infinite rerender loop (happens inconsistently) and Explore page crashing. Investigation proved that it's related to removing warnings about changed dataset in controls after a successful query. This PR makes updating Redux state conditional in order to run actions dispatch only when necessary and prevent infinite state updates.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis fixes a regression from #22082 which caused the tooltip to become cut when overflowing the chart DOM element. By making sure all tooltips have the `appendToBody` (see: https://echarts.apache.org/en/option.html#tooltip.appendToBody) property set to `true` we can ensure overflowing is handled correctly on all ECharts plugins.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the PR, make sure to use \"hide whitespace\", as the changes to the tooltip position function are all indentation changes.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow overflowing works as expected:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/203728064-0e0f2ab4-c126-4d60-bd4e-2d0cc66f5c7a.mp4\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously overflowing on certain charts caused the tooltip to be cut:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/203728137-848ad5af-7943-416c-82e7-adb3fe8d6f5d.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR is based on #22169 and fixes some issues with the native filters dropdown button:\r\n- Style tweaks\r\n- Adds icon and label\r\n- Adds logic to identify the active filters in the dropdown and update badge to reflect\r\n- Forces button to appear even when container has no overflowing items if custom dropdown content is inserted\r\n- Fixes an issue where filters/dividers would appear in horizontal overflow view when not in the overflow dropdown\r\n\r\nNote: there are still some issues with getting the component to resize correctly, but those will be addressed in a future PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"663\" alt=\"Screen

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFor existing dashboards, modifications imported via `/api/v1/assets/import/` are only appended if the modified dashboard contains a new chart. Modifications to dashboards that remove a chart are not implemented when imported through the assets API.\r\n\r\nThis change updates the assets API import method to remove all existing references to chart ids for the imported dashboard(s) before inserting the new chart ids. The change should benefit the management of Superset assets under source control.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nRemove a chart from a dashboard:\r\n- Export a dashboard and unzip assets bundle.\r\n- Remove a chart and all references to it from the exported yaml files\r\n- Import modified assets bundle as a zip by posting to `/api/v1/assets/import/` (see https://superset.apache.org/docs/api/#api)\r\n- Navigate to the modified dashboard in the Superset UI and observe the deleted chart is no longer visible\r\n\r\nAdd a chart to a dashboard:\r\n- In the same dashboard, remove a chart using the UI and save the dashboard\r\n- Import the previously exported assets bundle as a zip by posting to `/api/v1/assets/import/` \r\n- Navigate to the modified dashboard in the Superset UI and observe the deleted chart is now reinstated\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes 2 issues:\r\n1. Due to some faulty logic on the frontend, sometimes we converted `metric` control value from a string to an array. That resulted in `Unhashable type: 'list' error`.\r\n2. When user opened a chart, changed dataset, then changed viz type, and then clicked \"Update chart\", Explore would crash with `undefined` error. That's because of the fact that we were expecting all the controls from the previous viz type to still be available and have values, which might not be the case after changing viz type.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/203598667-a73f8fd8-c648-423e-8914-e010144c35a5.mov\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/203598799-73d5e33f-b679-4cb5-8b5e-42e8315a26b0.mov\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/203600227-494d33ec-07f4-4d1c-aac2-9bd122243bc3.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

How to get setDataMask to also update this chart, when doing so is not the default option (done in this example after edit dashboard, change properties so filter is applied to this chart too).

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup to #21954 which was missing the step to actually push the freshly-built `superset-websocket` image to Docker hub.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nThis can only be tested after merge, since the publication step is only run on `master`. After successful merge, we should see an `apache/superset-websocket` image in Docker hub, with the same tags as the main image.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue:

How to invoke setDataMask in a way that will include the current chart, when that is not the default option for this chart. (In the example displayed I edited the dashboard properties to allow this chart to receive it's own filter) Or otherwise how not to lose the zoom in the timeseries.\r\n2. How to allow drilling down from two timeseries charts so that the second drill down + filter cancels the first filter from the original chart (Or maybe it doesn't matter because it will always be more

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR adds filters and dividers to the horizontal filter bar, based off of @kgabryje's #22042 with some additional styling work on top.  Dividers and filter wrappers (labels + spacing) should look correct, though the filter input controls themselves are not yet styled in this PR.  Known issues that will be covered in future PRs:\r\n- Filter control inputs aren't updated for horizontal layout\r\n- \"More filters\" dropdown has incorrect icon, label, badge numbers and doesn't open automatically when related filter links are clicked\r\n- Overflow container may have some resizing quirks\r\n- Hover labels for dividers in horizontal overflow aren't showing up\r\n- Filter cards aren't positioned quite right\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nOur users really like the functionality of the adhoc filters in the explore view and were interested in something similar for for dashboard filtering. Anything that can be done with an adhoc filter native filter can be done with the other filter types and vice versa, but in order to filter by any given column the user has to either:\r\n- create a new filter (which can be a hassle to do on an adhoc basis),\r\n- or have a value filter for every column in the dashboard which is not feasible in every dashboard.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we added a new native filter type that reuses the adhoc filter component from the explore view to allow for more complex filtering to easily be done in a dashboard.\r\n\r\nThis solution provides the user with a lot of power and flexibility in dashboards, which is why it is behind a feature flag for now. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/202734225-c44cfa32-40e5-4edd-8cab-83dafe94bb2a.mp4\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/202734246-d650a4e7-c964-4f07-8a31-ea6e0e907270.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Enable Feature Flag: ADHOC_DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS\r\n- Navigate to dashboard\r\n- Add/Edit Filters on the sidebar\r\n- A new filter

SUMMARY\r\nThis is a continuation of #21931 which made it possible to execute reports as the object owners/creators etc. Unfortunately that PR didn't enable the same functionality for alerts, which

some components and especially charts is not complete yet. This PR is the effort to achieve the full localization of Superset. Additionally, it is a real pain to upgrade Superset as one should solve tons of merge conflicts, if they wrapped everything in `t()` and `__()` manually, while it is not reflected in the official repo

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug which is exemplifies all that is wrong with Superset. Spaghetti code (exacerbated by the fact that the native and legacy filters use different form-data encodings) and half baked features—legacy charts vs. ECharts. \r\n\r\nSpecifically this issue—where the applied filter indicator is missing—seems to only surface for NVD3TimeSeriesViz charts with time comparisons using the non-native temporal filters. The non-native filters _seem_ to encode which filters are applied using the [applied_time_extras](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/a9b229dd1dd9cb9dc8166b1392179fcccb4da138/superset/viz.py#L499-L502) form-data field which is defined in the [merge_extra_filters](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/e23efefc462fcc6f76a456f52f57f81e0c241a0a/superset/utils/core.py#L1185-L1186) method via an extraction of the `extra_filters` field—which is then disposed of. \r\n\r\nThe problem lies when this method is called multiple times. This the case when Advanced Analytics are used which requires running extra queries and re-evaluating the query object thus re-invoking the `merge_extra_filters` method, however this time with the `extra_filters` field missing from the form-data. The result is the `applied_time_extras` is now empty which translates to the filter indicator not reflecting that the temporal field has been defined. The solution is merely to preserve (as opposed to overwrite) the `applied_time_extras` field. \r\n\r\nNote this issue only impacted the applied filter indicator, i.e., the filters were correctly applied to the underlying chart.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n####

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis implements a flow in the new dataset creation page for when a table already has a dataset. It uses a simplified dataset fetch in the `AddDataset/index.tsx` file to cross-reference with the table list. If the table has a dataset, it gets a warning icon in the left panel. If the table is selected, the table's columns are still displayed, but the \"Create Dataset\" button is disabled and it has an info banner at the top informing the user of the pre-existing dataset with a link to that dataset in the upper-left corner of the alert. Clicking the \"View Dataset\" button in this alert will bring the user to the explore view of the existing dataset in a new tab.\r\n\r\n### ANIMATED GIF / SCREENSHOT\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### Screenshot of selected table with existing dataset\r\n<img width=\"1388\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-11-15 at 7 01 47 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/202057625-a50027ee-bd71-483f-a32e-b3cebfa83990.png\">\r\n\r\n#### Left panel warning icons\r\n![existingDSleftPanel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/202057245-1debb1d0-d6db-4b3a-8390-1b23ccd70102.gif)\r\n\r\n#### \"View dataset\"\r\n![existingDSViewDS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/202057751-40b064d7-e2fb-4f86-9502-f3dcbcaa7327.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR adds a `virtualization` prop to the recently added ant based Table component.  Virtualization allows the tables to be used in cases where there are hundreds or thousands of columns, or large dataset with many thousands of rows with no pagination enabled.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Checkout PR and open console at superset/superset-frontend\r\n2. run `npm ci`\r\n3. run `npm run storybook` and view docs and test virtualized table at: http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/design-system-components-table-overview--page under the \"Virtualization for Performance\" section, or interact directly with virtualized table instance at: http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/design-system-components-table-examples--virtualized-performance\r\n4. Ensure the other table example stories work correctly\r\n5. run `npm run dev-server` and go to http://localhost:9000/dataset/add/?testing to ensure the table instance used in the create dataset workflow still behaves as expected following instructions on this prior PR: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21948\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nFor the SIP 68 work, we were adding the SqlaTable dataset to the session during the shadow write process. Removing the dual write functionality impacted other unrelated SqlaTable instances that were trying to access the databases during different states of flush. For now, I'm putting back the current functionality until we can look into all of the edge cases here. \r\n\r\nOriginal revert PR: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21986\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
