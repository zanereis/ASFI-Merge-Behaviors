remarks:\n- LocalFileSystem object used for unit tests does not implement the append method.\n- Based on HDFS-4600 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-4600), appending to a file is only possible if the replication factor is lesser or equal than the number of data nodes in the cluster. For live testing with a standalone instance, consider changing the replication factor to 1 for the file you are appending to.\n\nAlso, I considered that it would be up to the user to handle the demarcator between two appended messages if such a demarcator is expected.\n\nFinally, if two processors are appending to the same file, errors may be raised due to concurrent access to the file. However, if redirecting the failure relationship back to the processor, the processors should, in the end, be able to append the messages. Obviously, in such a case, message ordering shall not be a requirement. Local testing suggests that users should use a MergeContent processor as upstream processor in order to ensure acceptable bandwidth.","created_at":"2016-11-03T20:56:16Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T12:24:19Z","closed_at":"2016-11-04T12:24:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c3859489bdfa8b5944774bd91da9a9ce54b673a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/1181/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/1181/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1181/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/a42ed1d547762b51dbe27275aa54e0736e7046d4","head":{"label":"pvillard31:NIFI-1322","ref":"NIFI-1322","sha":"a42ed1d547762b51dbe27275aa54e0736e7046d4","user":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51175123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTE3NTEyMw==","name":"nifi","full_name":"pvillard31/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pvillard31","id":11541012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQxMDEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11541012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31","html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pvillard31/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pvillard31/nifi","description":"Mirror

- Treating bcprov and bcpkix dependencies as provided by nifi in lib and updating projects to include them as provided where needed.\n\nNot sure of the best direction to take this, but the general thought process were to treat bcprov and bcpkix as \"framework level\" dependencies and include them in lib.  This allowed these common, foundational libraries to be shared by the entirety of the extension space.\n\nI am not a fan of having to add these every place the BC items are transitively used but did not also want to make a specified dependency in a parent pom across the entirety of the project.\n\nAfter patch:\n\n```\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 apiri staff  102 Oct 27 15:08 nifi-1.1.0-SNAPSHOT-bin\n-rw-r--r--

controller services - @RequiresInstanceClassLoading\n- Added new builder method to PropertyDescriptor dynamicallyModifiesClasspath(boolean)\n- Created a new InstanceClassLoader that maintains a child-first internal ClassLoader where classpath resources can be set, only used when component has @RequiresInstanceClassLoading\n- Added support to ExtensionManager to obtain ClassLoaders based on type + id, before we only had by type\n- If the type being requested supports instance class loading (the annotation described above) it will create an InstanceClassLoader which starts as a copy of the NAR ClassLoader for that type\n- When properties are set on a component, the framework will identify the properties that are classpath modifiers and add those resources to the InstanceClassLoader's child resources\n","created_at":"2016-10-24T18:14:03Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T17:23:19Z","closed_at":"2016-11-08T18:23:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0b376a8c7df830221809730ec3274dd8f5ca8e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/1156/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/1156/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/1156/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/5cb87871b997957d979f341b31b87a04f5894f9e","head":{"label":"bbende:NIFI-1712","ref":"NIFI-1712","sha":"5cb87871b997957d979f341b31b87a04f5894f9e","user":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48186740,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODE4Njc0MA==","name":"nifi","full_name":"bbende/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bbende","id":605416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende","html_url":"https://github.com/bbende","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbende/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bbende/nifi","description":"Mirror

lack of unit tests is due to the fact that we use Derby. When we get integration tests in place using MiniHS2, we can automate this kind of testing. In the meantime, here are some helpful HiveDDL statements you can use to populate a table with the different types, along with some queries that will illustrate the problem and solution:\n\nCreate a table with a field that is an array of structs:\n\n`create table arraytest (a ARRAY<STRUCT<name:STRING, age:INT>>)`\n\nInsert two elements (this assumes you have a table named \"dummy\" with at least one row):\n\n`insert into arraytest select array(named_struct(\"name\",\"Joe\",\"age\",42),named_struct(\"name\",\"Mary\",\"age\",24)) from dummy limit 1`\n\nSelect the whole array (as one field):\n\n`SELECT * FROM arraytest`\n\nSelect the structs as individual columns:\n\n`SELECT a[0], a[1] FROM arraytest`\n\nSelect a struct and a field from the other struct:\n\n`SELECT a[0], a[1].name FROM arraytest`\n\nThe first SELECT should generate a single field/column in CSV, the other two should have two columns, all properly escaped to give valid CSV.
