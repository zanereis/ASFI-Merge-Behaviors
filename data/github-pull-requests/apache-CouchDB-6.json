pending changes count for the `descending=true` didn't indicate the number of pending changes. Instead, it returned the negative value of the already emitted rows. So for `descending=true&limit=2`, it would return -2; for `descending=true&limit=5`, it would return -5. That wasn't a very useful value, so let's fix it to return the actual number of pending changes.\r\n\r\nWhen traversing the changes feed backwards, the number of pending changes until the start will be equal to the total number of changes, minus the number of changes from the current start sequence until the end.\r\n\r\nIssue:

is not always beneficial for the performance if the Mango query planner tries to assign an index to the selector.  User-specified indexes may save the day, but since they are only hints for the planner, automated overrides can still happen.\r\n\r\nIntroduce the concept of \"strict index selection\" (h/t @willholley) which lets the user to request the exclusive use of a specific index.  When it is not possible, give up on planning and return an HTTP 400 response right away.  This way the user has the chance to learn about the missing index, request its creation and try again later.\r\n\r\nThe feature comes with a configuration toggle.  By default, the feature is disabled to maintain backward compatibility, but the user may ask for this behavior via the new `use_index_strict` query parameter for a specific query.  Note that, similarly, `use_index_strict` could be used to disable strict index selection temporarily when it is enabled on the server.\r\n\r\nFixes #4511\r\n\r\n## Checklist for the review\r\n\r\n-

results are rendered inconsistently in the JSON response because a single zero-valued scalar is added to the place of the object which would otherwise represent the detailed statistics.\r\n\r\nFor example, a \"no match\" search with counts faceting, such as\r\n\r\n```\r\n/{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_search/{idx}?limit=0&q=city1:London*&counts=[\"city2\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(where there are no documents matching the query, i.e. no `city1` field has a value `London`) results in the following JSON:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"counts\": {\r\n  \"city2\": 0.0\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut it should be like this instead:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"counts\": {\r\n  \"city2\": {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is because the expectation is that `city2` would contain a map of other city counts (if there were matches), e.g.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"counts\": {\r\n  \"city2\": {\r\n    \"Aberystwyth\": 1004,\r\n    \"Bristol\": 1019\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is a similar impact for ranges.  Although the following one is a meaningless query (because there is no range defined), it manifests the same issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_search/{idx}?q=*:*&limit=0&ranges={\"code\":{\"high\":\"\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"total_rows\": 5095,\r\n  \"bookmark\": \"g2o\",\r\n  \"rows\": [],\r\n  \"ranges\": {\r\n    \"code\": 0\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich should be:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"total_rows\": 5095,\r\n  \"bookmark\": \"g2o\",\r\n  \"rows\": [],\r\n  \"ranges\": {\r\n    \"code\": {}\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is because the expectation is that the value for the field code should be the mapping of ranges to counts, not a count itself, viz.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/{db}/_design/{ddoc}/_search/{idx}?q=*:*&limit=0&ranges={\"code\":{\"low\":\"[0%20TO%2010]\",\"high\":\"[11%20TO%20Infinity]\"}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nreturns\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"total_rows\": 5095,\r\n  \"bookmark\": \"g2o\",\r\n  \"rows\": [],\r\n  \"ranges\": {\r\n    \"code\": {\r\n      \"high\": 0,\r\n      \"low\": 5095\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes hard to properly capture the schema of the respective API and complicates the development of the SDK.\r\n\r\nThanks @ricellis for the detailed analysis of the problem, the examples, and his proposal about the solution.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by

Overview\r\n\r\nAs a way to migrate users to a strong password hashing scheme without getting a performance hit each time, assuming the client will send back the cookie we send them. we check the cookie first and avoid the hit, but we still fall back to basic auth if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe AuthSession cookie is extended with a new field that indicates whether it was issued by the default authentication handler or the cookie authentication handler. If the cookie was issued by the default authentication handler the cookie authentication handler will check the username in the basic auth header, if present, is a match for the name in the cookie. If it is not, the cookie is ignored. This ensures that the basic auth header takes precedence for any client that got an unasked-for cookie and ensures their operations are performed as the user they intended.\r\n\r\nh/t @glynnbird for

for user B, the request will run as user A, because we check the cookie first.\r\n\r\nafter my patch, if you send a cookie for user A and basic auth for user B, the request will run as user B, because we ignore the cookie now because the names don't match.\r\n\r\nI think, instead, the default_auth_handler should create its own cookie, which only it reads on future requests, that serves as a cache of the original authentication approval.\r\n\r\nReverting so this doesn't linger on main while I work up a better

the `r` query option (for read quorum) is formatted in an awkward way when added to the `_explain` JSON response (excerpt, `r` is set to `1` in the query object):\r\n\r\n```json\r\n ...\r\n \"opts\": {\r\n    ...\r\n    \"r\": [\r\n      49\r\n    ],\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe value there is the ASCII code of `1` and the nesting list denotes the string.  That is because `r` is stored as a list internally and when it comes to rendering, `jiffy` will interpret the contents as an array.

Overview\r\n\r\nAdd some opt-in countermeasures if disk space gets critically low, with the aim of avoiding hitting end of disk.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nEnable the disk monitor, run a CouchDB node on a small disk, and add lots of data. You should find that background indexing stops (at 80% full) and then stale view queries and database updates are blocked. Reduce disk usage (allow compaction to run to completion, or delete databases) and see both interventions automatically unlock. \r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n##

we used a stale `Waiting` list of workers instead of the updated `NewWaiting` one. Then, when we recursed back to the top in `maybe_send_data/1`, and tried to reply to all waiting clients, we re-sent the same block to the client. That client would then get more attachment blocks than it expected and would throw an `attachment longer than expected` error.\r\n\r\nAt the API level this would manifest as an intermittent 400 (bad_request) HTTP error for multipart document + attachments PUTs. For the error to occur, a `{hello_from_writer, ...}` has to be recieved when we're in the bottom part of `maybe_send_data/1` in the couch_httpd_multipart parser. However, due to how CouchDB replicator skips over documents PUTs which generate 4xx errors, the effect was that these documents were skipped over during replication, with only a `doc_write_failures` statistic bump to indicate that something went wrong. There is a somewhat related issue for discussion whether that replicator behavior is desirable [1]\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4676.\r\n\r\nThanks to @rnewson in helping identifying and debugging the issue.","created_at":"2023-07-17T21:05:08Z","updated_at":"2023-07-18T13:07:54Z","closed_at":"2023-07-18T12:35:37Z","merged_at":"2023-07-18T12:35:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"e892198483abbe0cab39d71bd2201a40f05be07b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kocolosk","id":16679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Njc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk","html_url":"https://github.com/kocolosk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kocolosk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4679/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/4679/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/4679/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/f2e921998e7cfc5e3d16fc3e1c50c6f5e42ee518","head":{"label":"apache:fix-multipart-attachment-upload","ref":"fix-multipart-attachment-upload","sha":"f2e921998e7cfc5e3d16fc3e1c50c6f5e42ee518","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

with attachments are written as individual HTTP PUT multipart requests. If a document PUT request fails with a 401, 403 or 413 error, the expectation is that the replicator would skip over that document, increment the `doc_write_failures` metric and continue replicating. That behavior is by design. However, previously, before this commit, documents were also skipped in case of any unknown 4xx error. This commit switches the default behavior such that unexpected 4xx errors do not continue. If the error is intermittent, the job will crash, retry, and would eventually succeed. If the error is persistent, exponential backoff will keep it from retrying indefinitely in a tight loop.\r\n\r\nDocuments will be skipped only for 401/403/413/415 HTTP error and for 400 error code a reason related to attachment name validation failures.\r\n\r\nThe second improvement in this commit is that http errors and error reasons bubble up though the API and are emitted as error logs. This should help users diagnose any issue quicker.\r\n\r\nIssue:

histograms are a major bottleneck under high concurrency, as described in #4650. This was noticed during performance testing, confirmed using Erlang VM lock counting, then verified by creating a test release with histogram update logic commented out [1].\r\n\r\nCouchDB doesn't use most of the Folsom statistics and metrics; we only use counters, gauges and one type of sliding window, sampling histogram. Instead of trying to re-design and update Folsom, which is a generic stats and metrics library, take a simpler approach and create just the three metrics we need, and then remove Folsom and Bear dependencies altogether.\r\n\r\nAll the metrics types we re-implement are based on two relatively new Erlang/OTP features: counters [2] and persistent terms [3]. Counters are mutable arrays of integers, which allow fast concurrent updates, and persistent terms allow fast, global, constant time access to Erlang terms.\r\n\r\nGauges and counters are implemented as counter arrays with one element. Histograms are represented as counter arrays where each array element is a histogram bin. Since we're dealing with sliding time window histograms, we have a tuple of counter arrays, where each time instant (each second) is a counter array. The overall histogram object then looks something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHistogram = {\r\n     1          = [1, 2, ..., ?BIN_COUNT]\r\n     2          = [1, 2, ..., ?BIN_COUNT]\r\n     ...\r\n     TimeWindow = [1, 2, ..., ?BIN_COUNT]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo keep the structure immutable we need to set a limit on both the number of bins and the time window size. To limit the number of bins we need to set some minimum and maximum value limits. Since almost all our histograms record access times in milliseconds, we pick a range from 10 microseconds up to over one hour. Histogram bin widths are increasing exponentially in order to keep a reasonable precision across the whole range of values. This encoding is similar to how floating point numbers work. Additional details on how this works are described in the the `couch_stats_histogram.erl` module.\r\n\r\nTo keep the histogram object structure immutable, the time window is used in a circular fashion. The time parameter to the histogram update/3 function is the monotonic clock time, and the histogram time index is computed as `Time rem TimeWindow`. So, as the monotonic time is advancing forward, the histogram time index will loop around. This comes with a minor annoyance of having to allocate a larger time window to accommodate some process which cleans stale (expired) histogram entries, possibly with some extra buffers to ensure the currently updated interval and the interval ready to be cleaned would not overlap. This periodic cleanup is performed in the couch_stats_server process.\r\n\r\nBesides performance, the new histograms have two other improvements over the Folsom ones:\r\n\r\n  - They record every single value. Previous histograms did sampling and recorded mostly just the first 1024 values during each time instant (second).\r\n\r\n  - They are mergeable. Multiple histograms can be merged with corresponding bins summed together. This could allow cluster wide histogram summaries or gathering histograms from individual processes, then combining them at the end in a central process.\r\n\r\nOther performance improvement in this commit is eliminating the need to periodically flush or scrape stats in the background in both couch_stats and prometheus apps. Stats fetching from persistent terms and counters takes less than 4 milliseconds [4], and sliding time window histogram will always return the last 10 seconds of data no matter when the stats are queried. Now that will be done only when the stats are actually queried.\r\n\r\nSince the Folsom library was abstracted away behind a couch_stats API, the rest of the applications do not need to be updated. They still call `couch_stats:update_histogram/2`, `couch_stats:increment_counter/1`, etc.\r\n\r\nPreviously couch_stats did not have any tests at all. Folsom and Bear had some tests, but I don't think we ever ran those test suites. To rectify the situation added tests to cover the functionality. All the newly added or updated modules should be have near or exactly 100% test coverage.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4650#issue-1764685693\r\n[2]

of `_find` queries is often considered opaque by the users.  They do not have enough insights about which index was selected and why, which can make hard to compose better queries.  To address these problems, the change proposes to extend the `/{db}/_explain` endpoint with the following:\r\n\r\n- `index_candidates`: This attribute contains the list of all the other indexes that were not chosen for serving the query.  The items in the list tell whether the given index is usable, what the reason was for its exclusion, and how \"far\" it is from being selected.\r\n- `selector_hints`: This attribute shows which fields are indexable and unindexable in the selector per each (available) index kind.\r\n\r\n*Warning*:\r\n\r\n- The `covered` attribute in the `_explain` output has been changed to `covering` so that it now matches the attribute name used in the analysis. \r\n- The `_explain` will return HTTP 200 even if there is no usable index.  This makes it different from how `_find` would respond to the same set of parameters.\r\n\r\nSamples, `index_candidates`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"index_candidates\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"index\": {\r\n        \"ddoc\": null,\r\n        \"name\": \"_all_docs\",\r\n        \"type\": \"special\",\r\n        \"def\": {\r\n          \"fields\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"_id\": \"asc\"\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n     \"analysis\": {\r\n        \"usable\": false,\r\n        \"reasons\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"unfavored_type\"\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"ranking\": 1,\r\n        \"covering\": null\r\n     }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"index\": {\r\n        \"ddoc\": \"_design/age\",\r\n        \"name\": \"age\",\r\n        \"type\": \"json\",\r\n        \"partitioned\": false,\r\n        \"def\": {\r\n          \"fields\": [\r\n            {\r\n              \"age\": \"asc\"\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      \"analysis\": {\r\n        \"usable\": false,\r\n        \"reasons\": [\r\n          {\r\n            \"name\": \"field_mismatch\"\r\n          }\r\n        ],\r\n        \"ranking\": 2,\r\n        \"covering\": false\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `selector_hints`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n  \"selector_hints\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"json\",\r\n      \"indexable_fields\": [],\r\n      \"unindexable_fields\": [\r\n        \"name.first\"\r\n      ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"text\",\r\n      \"indexable_fields\": [\r\n        \"name.first\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"unindexable_fields\": []\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"type\": \"nouveau\",\r\n      \"indexable_fields\": [\r\n        \"name.first\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"unindexable_fields\": []\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on this information, Fauxton could display more useful hints and tips for the users on building the queries.\r\n\r\nAs an extra, the unit test coverage is increased throughout the Mango modules.

replication jobs are started with just shard names (paths), mem3_rep creates `#shard{}` records from those and fills in some fields like `name` and `node`. However we had left the `range` field as `undefined`. Until a recent fix to avoid duplicating document purges [1], we didn't care about ranges, so it was just untidy but not a big problem. Since the fix, we rely on having a proper ranges and would get function or case clause errors during purge infos pulling and pushing operations.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to use the `mem3:range/1` function to obtain the range based on the shard path if we can. In some cases we may replicate node local databases, so we still have to account for the cases that ranges may be `undefined`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fix, improve the tests coverage by testing replication of purges and local endpoints. Also, take the opportunity to clean up the mem3_rep_tests suite to use the newer `?TDEF_FE` macro.\r\n\r\n[1]

we get sequence before the split, we'll fill in the missing (now split) ranges with a special `{split, OldNodeUUid}` marker. However, when sequences are emitted in the changes API, that will make the N- prefix (SeqSum) bounce around from higher to lower numbers, while users expect those to be mostly incrementing. So take a conservative approach and assume it will be a full rewind for that range, and use 0 instead. This is a purely cosmetic thing, when we decode the sequence that prefix gets thrown away anyway.\r\n\r\nTo emphasize that the sequence prefix is mostly a visual aid, rename the `seq/1` function to `fake_packed_seq/1` with a comment about what it does and a note about the special split case.\r\n\r\nFixes a part of issue:

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it's possible for databases created in previous test runs to cause test failures like this:\r\n```\r\n  fabric_bench_test:97: -with/1-fun-0- (t_db_deletion_ignores_other_dbs)...*failed*\r\nin function fabric_bench_test:t_db_deletion_ignores_other_dbs/1 (test/eunit/fabric_bench_test.erl, line 76) in call from eunit_test:run_testfun/1 (eunit_test.erl, line 71) in call from eunit_proc:run_test/1 (eunit_proc.erl, line 531) in call from eunit_proc:with_timeout/3 (eunit_proc.erl, line 356) in call from eunit_proc:handle_test/2 (eunit_proc.erl, line 514) in call from

**error:{badmatch,{error,file_exists}}\r\n  output:<<\"\">>\r\n```\r\nThis deletes databases created by the tests, and also preemptively deletes databases that might exist from previous test failures that were unable to clean up after themselves.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing

benefits over Mozilla Spidermonkey:\r\n\r\n* Small. We're using 6 or so C files vs 700+ SM91 C++ files.\r\n\r\n * Built with Apache CouchDB as opposed having to maintain a separate SM package, like for RHEL9, for instance, where they dropped support for SM already: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4154.\r\n\r\n * Embedding friendly. Designed from ground-up for embedding. SM has been updating the C++ API such that we have to keep copy-pasting new versions of our C++ code every year or so: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4305.\r\n\r\n * Easy to modify to accept Spidermonkey 1.8.5 top level functions for map/reduce code so we don't have have to parse the JS, AST transform it, and then re-compile it.\r\n\r\n * Better sandboxing. Creating a whole JSRuntime takes only 300 microseconds, so we can afford to do that on reset. JSRuntimes cannot share JS data or object between them.\r\n\r\n * Seems to be faster in preliminary benchmarking with small concurrent VDU and view builds:\r\n     https://gist.github.com/nickva/ed239651114794ebb138b1f16c5f6758\r\n     - 4x faster than SM 1.8.5\r\n     - 5x faster than SM 91\r\n     - 6x reduced memory usage per couchjs process (5MB vs 30MB)\r\n\r\n * Allows compiling JS bytecode ahead of time a C array of bytes.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuickJS can be built alongside Spidermonkey and toggled on/off at runtime:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --dev --js-engine=quickjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes it the default engine. But Spidermonkey can still be set in the config option.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[couchdb]\r\njs_engine = spidermonkey | quickjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo test individual views, without switching the default use the `javascript_quickjs` language in the design docs. To keep using Spidermonkey engine after switching the default, can use `javascript_spidermonkey` language in design docs. However, language selection will reset the view and the view will have to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to build without Spidermonkey support completely by using:\r\n```\r\n./configure --disable-spidermonkey\r\n```\r\n\r\nIssue: https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4448\r\n\r\n### Some basic benchmarking ###\r\n\r\nSummary: \r\n   - 3x faster than SM 1.8.5\r\n   - 4x faster than SM 91\r\n   - 6x reduced memory usage per couchjs process (5MB vs 30MB).\r\n\r\n**Setup Details**\r\n\r\nMacOS Intel, Erlang 24, ./dev/run -n1\r\n\r\nBenchmark script: https://gist.github.com/nickva/c0cbf6a556cc2dc7dd6ee79f504f5f84.\r\n  -  20 concurrent workers create a db and:\r\n     * Insert 100 docs, 10 ddoc(views) and query the views\r\n     * Repeat that 3 times in a row\r\n     \r\nResults measured by the zsh `time` command  as `% time ./stampede_dbs_ddocs_vdus.py ...`. CPU usage is reported for the client not the couchjs process or Erlang VM.

internal replicator (mem3_rep) replicated purge infos to/from all the target shards. Instead, it should push/pull changes only to appropriate ranges if those purge infos belong there based on database's hash function.\r\n\r\nUsers experienced this error as a failure in database which contains purges, which was split twice in a row. For example, if a Q=8 database is split to Q=16, then split again from Q=16 to Q=32, the second split operation might fail with a `split_state:initial_copy ...{{badkey,not_in_range}` error. The misplaced purge infos would be noticed only during the second split, when the initial copy phase would crash because some purge infos do not hash to neither one of the two target ranges. Moreover, the crash would lead to repeated retries, which generated a huge job history log.\r\n\r\nThe fix consists of three improvements:\r\n\r\n  1) Internal replicator is updated to filter purge infos based on the db hash.\r\n\r\n  2) Account for the fact that some users' dbs might already contain misplaced\r\n    purge infos. Since it's a known bug, we anticipate that error and ignore\r\n    misplaced purge info during the second shard split operation with a warning\r\n    emitted in the logs.\r\n\r\n  3) Make similar range errors fatal, and emit a clear error in the logs and\r\n     job history so any future range errors are immediately obvious.\r\n\r\nFixes

cluster upgrades from 3.2 to 3.3 when instance start time switched from being always  `0` to an actual timestamp, replication jobs will crash when endpoints are upgraded. Replication jobs were started when endpoint emitted a `0` and then it becomes a non-`0` value which will crash the next checkpoint attempt.\r\n\r\nAfter the crash jobs will restart and continue fine where they left off without rewinding. However they will make a logging mess while they crash. All four workers will exit with the `{checkpoint_commit_failure,...}` error. This commit make it the checkpoint ignore mismatches if one of the instance start times is 0.\r\n\r\nIssue:

benefits over SM:\r\n\r\n * Small. We're using 6 or so C files vs 700+ SM91 C++ files.\r\n\r\n * Built with Apache CouchDB as opposed having to maintain a separate SM package, like for RHEL9, for instance, where they dropped support for SM already. (see https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/4154).\r\n\r\n * Embedding friendly. Designed from ground-up for embedding. SM has been updating the C++ API such that we have to keep copy-pasting new versions of our C++ code every year or so. (see https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/4305).\r\n\r\n * Easy to modify to accept Spidermonkey 1.8.5 top level functions for map/reduce code so we don't have have to parse the JS, AST trasform it, and then re-compile it.\r\n\r\n * Configurable runtime feature set - can disable workers, promises and other API and features which may not work well in a backend JS environment. Some users may want more, some may want to disable even Date(time) features to hedge again Spectre-style attacks (spectreattack.com).\r\n\r\n * Allows granular time (reduction) trackign if we wanted to provide a runtime allowance for each function.\r\n\r\n * Better sandboxing. Creating a whole JSRuntime takes only 300 microseconds, so we can afford to do that on reset. JSRuntimes cannot share JS data or object between them.\r\n\r\n * Seems to be faster in preliminary benchmarking with small concurrent VDU and view builds: https://gist.github.com/nickva/ed239651114794ebb138b1f16c5f6758 Results seem promising: - 4x faster than SM 1.8.5 - 5x faster than SM 91 - 6x reduced memory usage per couchjs process (5MB vs 30MB)\r\n\r\n * Allows compiling JS bytecode ahead of time a C array of bytes.\r\n\r\nQuickJS can be built alongside spidermonkey and toggled on/off at runtime:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure --dev --js-engine=quickjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes it the default engine. But spidermonkey can still be set in the config option.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[couchdb]\r\njs_engine = spidermonkey | quickjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly tested on MacOS and Linux. All `make check` tests pass there.\r\n\r\nIssue:

Fix the faulty `index_array_length` tests:\r\n\r\n    - They do not check the count of the returned documents but blindly\r\n      assume that there will be results.  Add an explicit assertion about\r\n      the expected number of documents in the response so it could be\r\n      detected if something breaks.\r\n\r\n    - The assertion on the document count revealed that the test database\r\n      is actually empty because it is immediately wiped out after creation\r\n      by a misplaced `recreate()` call.\r\n\r\n    - When the indexing on the array lengths is disabled, there shall be no\r\n      documents returned, and not the sizes of the `favorites` arrays in\r\n      the results shall be zero.  That is because there is no information\r\n      available on the sizes of the arrays.\r\n\r\n- The result of the `mango.has_text_service()` checks is implicitly forecasted by the `@unittest.skipUnless` annotations in the head of the class declaration.

times can vary widely, especially on a remote block storage, so add a histogram and count for fsync calls. At a higher level, we can coalesce similar update doc requests from multiple clients, so add metrics to track that as well.\r\n\r\nImproving couch_proc_manager, and experimenting with quickjs js engine [1], noticed we lacked metrics in that area. Add metrics to track query process acquires, start/stops (including crashes) as well as how many prompt and prompt errors we have. These should help gain some confidence when upgrading to a new engine version or engine type by comparing the before and after metrics output.\r\n\r\nTrying to test some of these new metrics, noticed couch_file tests did most of the test logic in the setup part, which resulted in plenty of log noise during the test runs about started/stopped applications, so updated a few tests which were affected by this PR to use the ?TDEF_FE macro. That should make test output a bit smaller and neater.\r\n\r\n[1]

internal replicator default batch size and batch count. On systems with a slower (remote) disks, or a slower dist protocol, internal replicator can easily fall behind during a high rate of bulk_docs ingestion. For each batch of 100 it had to sync security properties, make an rpc call to fetch remote target sync checkpoint, open handles, fetch revs diff, etc. If there are changes to sync it would also incur the commit (fsync) delay as well. It make sense to operate on slightly larger batches to increase performance. I picked 500 as that's the default for the (external) replicator.\r\n\r\nIt also helps to keep replicating more than one batch once we've brought the source and target data into the page cache, so opted to make it do 5 batches per job run at most.\r\n\r\nA survey of other batch sizes already in use by the internal replicator:\r\n  * Shard splitting uses a batch of 2000 [1].\r\n  * Seed system dbs replication uses 1000 [2]\r\n\r\nThere is some danger in creating too large of a rev list for highly conflicted documents. In that case already have chunking for max rev [3] to keep everything under 5000 revs per batch.\r\n\r\nTo be on the safe side both values are now configurable and can be adjusted at runtime.\r\n\r\nTo validate how this affects performance used a simple benchmarking utility:\r\n https://gist.github.com/nickva/9a2a3665702a876ec06d3d720aa19b0a\r\n\r\nWith defaults:\r\n```\r\n fabric_bench:go().\r\n...\r\n *** DB fabric-bench-1683835787725432000 [{q,4},{n,3}] created.

previous work that introduced the keys-only covering indexes (#4512) did not count with the case that database might be partitioned. And since they use a different format for their own local indexes and the code does not handle that, it will crash.  When indexes are defined globally for the partitioned databases, there is no problem because the view row does not include information about the partition, i.e. it is transparent.\r\n\r\nAdd the missing support for these scenarios and extend the test suite to cover them as well.  That latter required some changes to the base classes in the integration test suite as it apparently completely misses out on running test cases for partitioned databases.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n-

methods.\r\n\r\nWe should send 405 for a resource that exists but doesn't support the request's method.\r\nWe should send 404 for a resource that doesn't exist at all.\r\n\r\nReverting this gives us a 500 / function_clause, which is at least honest (the server has made an error) but we should circle back and send better errors.\r\n\r\nNoting that;\r\n\r\n1) extra paths for _all_docs gives the desired 404 but for a silly reason (it matches the clause that looks for attachments, and you can't make a doc called _all_docs to attach anything to)\r\n2) extra paths for _changes are ignored (and the _changes request works as expected) because handle_changes_req doesn't insist on a pattern for path_parts\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we handle invalid paths in request handlers inconsistently, which

the 128 bit variant of xxHash as it has the same output size as MD5, is non-cryptographic, and is quite a bit faster [1].\r\n\r\nWriting xxHash checksums is disabled by default. This would allow us to make an intermediate release to which we can downgrade to as it can read both xxHash and MD5 checksums. In a future release writing xxHash checksums will flip to\r\n`true`, but it would be possible to safely downgrade to the intermediate releases which would be aware of xxHash checksums and won't interpret them as corrupt data.\r\n\r\nIf downgrade is not a concern, using xxHash checksums can yield a noticeable speed improvement when reading larger documents (128KB+ or so).\r\n\r\nThere is a metric which would indicate if any MD5 checksums are present after the xxHash has been enabled.\r\n\r\nTo avoid duplicating the verification logic for headers and blocks, combined them into one function with a check if it's for a header or not. This is to preserve previous behavior where or headers we don't want to emit emergency logs if they fail the check since we may be just reading left-over uncommitted data from the file end.\r\n\r\nAdd a stats counter to indicate if there are still any MD5 checksums found during normal cluster operation after it has been enabled.\r\n\r\nDuring test coverage checks noticed we never actually tested block level corruption before so added a test for that as well for both xxHash and legacy cases.\r\n\r\n[1] Comparison of hashing a 4KB block (units are microseconds).\r\n```\r\n(node1@127.0.0.1)20>
