ticket concerns an inconsistency introduced in a server due to a transaction taking a long time to complete at the same time a new copy of a region/bucket is being created.\r\n\r\nI removed the ability for this method to exit without the operation count\r\nfalling to zero.  Instead it issues a fatal-level log message, which\r\ntranslates into a severe-level alert for operators.  This can help tech\r\nsupport know which server a customer should terminate in order to break\r\na distributed deadlock.\r\n\r\nI also added an info-level message that is issued if a warning/fatal message\r\nhas been issued noting that the wait has completed.  This parallels what\r\nwe do in ReplyProcessor21 if we've issued a warning that a cache-op response\r\nhasn't been received within the ack-wait-threshold period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

this bug all the servers in a test hung when one of them had a bucket but never became the primary owner.  This is because the server thought that another server was driving creation of the bucket and would tell it to become the primary when done creating redundant copies.  In reality that server destroyed its partitioned region and would never send a become-primary message.\r\n\r\nThe bucket-creator establishes a primaryElector, the ID of the server that requested creation of the bucket.  Having this ID in place keeps the bucket creator from volunteering to become primary.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to ignore the primaryElector if it is no longer known to the RegionAdvisor. This means that the elector has somehow gone away - either it crashed, shut down or destroyed its region.\r\n\r\nThis commit also has changes to Host.java to undeprecate the class and add deprecation only to its getVM(int) method.  The class itself is still heavily used and has methods that cannot be deprecated until there are alternative mechanisms in place.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

was going negative during a transaction because:\r\n1. When txApplyDestroy was adding a new entry that would be a TOMBSTONE; it was setting the value of the new entry initially to Token.DESTROYED. This was wrong. It should have waited to set this until later when it knew it was in \"tokenMode\".\r\n2. When makeTombstone was later called it did a check to see if the entry was new. It based this in the value being Token.REMOVE_PHASE1. Since it was not (it was DESTROYED) this prevented it from doing a corrective inc of the stat to prevent it from going negative.\r\n\r\nSo the fix is the use REMOVE_PHASE1 during initialization and to

a region that has been configured with off-heap storage and overflow\r\nto disk, memory can be leaked if\r\n\r\n- region clear\r\n- region destroy\r\n- region replace\r\n\r\nall happen concurrently. The root cause appears to be region clear\r\nmodifying entries for values stored on disk without synchronizing the\r\nentries. This prevents replace from freeing the off-heap memory for the\r\nnew value when the replace fails because the region is being destroyed.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds an integration test that uses spies on a region entry\r\nto trigger the concurrent events during a replace operation and checks\r\nfor orphaned off-heap memory.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is to not modify the region entries on disk while\r\nperforming a clear operation.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Dan Smith <dsmith@pivotal.io>\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
