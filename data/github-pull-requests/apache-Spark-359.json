allows configuration to be more flexible, for example, when the cluster does\nnot have a homogeneous configuration (e.g. packages are installed on different\npaths in different nodes). By allowing one to reference the environment from\nthe conf, it becomes possible to work around those in certain cases.\n\nAs part of the implementation, ConfigEntry now keeps track of all \"known\" configs\n(i.e. those created through the use of ConfigBuilder), since that list is used\nby the resolution code. This duplicates some code in SQLConf, which could potentially\nbe merged with this now. It will also make it simpler to implement some missing\nfeatures such as filtering which configs show up in the UI or in event logs - which\nare not part of this change.\n\nAnother change is in the way ConfigEntry reads config data; it now takes a string\nmap and a function that reads env variables, so that it can be called both from\nSparkConf and SQLConf. This makes it so both places follow the same read path,\ninstead of having to replicate certain logic in SQLConf.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDue to backward-compatibility reasons, the following Parquet schema is ambiguous:\r\n\r\n```\r\noptional group f (LIST) {\r\n  repeated group list {\r\n    optional group element {\r\n      optional int32 element;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to the parquet-format spec, when interpreted as a standard 3-level layout, this type is equivalent to the following SQL type:\r\n\r\n```\r\nARRAY<STRUCT<element: INT>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when interpreted as a legacy 2-level layout, it's equivalent to\r\n\r\n```\r\nARRAY<STRUCT<element: STRUCT<element: INT>>>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHistorically, to disambiguate these cases, we employed two methods:\r\n- `ParquetSchemaConverter.isElementType()`\r\n  \r\n  Used to disambiguate the above cases while converting Parquet types to Spark types.\r\n- `ParquetRowConverter.isElementType()`\r\n  \r\n  Used to disambiguate the above cases while instantiating row converters that convert Parquet records to Spark rows.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these two methods make a different decision about the above problematic Parquet type and caused SPARK-16344.\r\n\r\n`ParquetRowConverter.isElementType()` is necessary for Spark 1.4 and earlier versions because Parquet requested schemata are directly converted from Spark schemata in these versions. The converted Parquet schemata may be incompatible with actual schemata of the underlying physical files when the files are written by a system/library that uses a schema conversion scheme that is different from Spark when writing Parquet LIST and MAP fields.\r\n\r\nIn Spark 1.5, Parquet requested schemata are always properly tailored from schemata of physical files to be read. Thus `ParquetRowConverter.isElementType()` is no longer necessary. This PR replaces this method with a simple yet accurate scheme: whenever an ambiguous Parquet type is hit, convert the type in question back to a Spark type using `ParquetSchemaConverter` and check whether it matches the corresponding Spark type.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test cases added in `ParquetHiveCompatibilitySuite` and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently our Optimizer may reorder the predicates to run them more efficient, but in non-deterministic condition, change the order between deterministic parts and non-deterministic parts may change the number of input rows. For example:\n`SELECT a FROM t WHERE rand() < 0.1 AND a = 1`\nAnd\n`SELECT a FROM t WHERE a = 1 AND rand() < 0.1`\nmay call rand() for different times and therefore the output rows differ.\n\nThis PR improved this condition by checking whether the predicate is placed before any non-deterministic predicates.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExpanded related testcases in FilterPushdownSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-07-01T09:17:18Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T18:43:25Z","closed_at":"2016-07-13T16:23:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c85cf9578f615bc3898c611e3869e9755305b23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14012/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14012/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14012/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9b2b5a86205e5ff020d264cb21ba48bbe0074790","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:ppd","ref":"ppd","sha":"9b2b5a86205e5ff020d264cb21ba48bbe0074790","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

This patch is based on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13989, but removes the public Dataset.refresh() API as well as improved test coverage.\n\nNote that I actually think the public refresh() API is very useful. We can in the future implement it by also invalidating the lazy vals in QueryExecution (or alternatively just create a new QueryExecution).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRe-enabled a previously

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nStar expansion over a table containing zero column does not work since 1.6. However, it works in Spark 1.5.1. This PR is to fix the issue in the master branch.\n\nFor example, \n\n``` scala\nval rddNoCols = sqlContext.sparkContext.parallelize(1 to 10).map(_ => Row.empty)\nval dfNoCols = sqlContext.createDataFrame(rddNoCols, StructType(Seq.empty))\ndfNoCols.registerTempTable(\"temp_table_no_cols\")\nsqlContext.sql(\"select * from temp_table_no_cols\").show\n```\n\nWithout the fix, users will get the following the exception:\n\n```\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed\n        at scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:221)\n        at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedStar.expand(unresolved.scala:199)\n```\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nTests are added\n","created_at":"2016-07-01T03:11:31Z","updated_at":"2016-07-03T15:12:11Z","closed_at":"2016-07-03T08:49:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fc14f3410fe0d79ef37ffb45014e7f4c3bc3e61f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14007/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14007/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14007/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bd83643fb1b7adf8eef4694c45fb4b061c03a012","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:starExpansionTableWithZeroColumn","ref":"starExpansionTableWithZeroColumn","sha":"bd83643fb1b7adf8eef4694c45fb4b061c03a012","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n1. Add more specific error prompt for include_example.rb\n2. Replace example code in mllib-data-types.md using include_example\n\nFor Scala/Python code, I add imports inside each function, which is easy to control those codes. Java import doesn't support that, so I leave them with duplications.\n\nBTW The `tallSkinnyQR` in both Scala and Java failed when I ran the code. I'll look into them soon.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually by running new example code, and generating docs with jekyll

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch introduces a flag to disable loading test tables in TestHiveSparkSession and disables that in Python. This fixes an issue in which python/run-tests would fail due to failure to load test tables.\n\nNote that these test tables are not used outside of HiveCompatibilitySuite. In the long run we should probably decouple the loading of test tables from the test Hive setup.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a test only change.\n","created_at":"2016-06-30T22:58:44Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T02:04:18Z","closed_at":"2016-07-01T02:04:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5594d4edc67d7e939b0ca37c514e5a2c5c136289","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/14005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/14005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/59829729e7f4536dd828068bf9e2cd7eac11d55f","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-15954","ref":"SPARK-15954","sha":"59829729e7f4536dd828068bf9e2cd7eac11d55f","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn structured streaming, Spark does not report errors when the specified directory does not exist. This is a behavior different from the batch mode. This patch changes the behavior to fail if the directory does not exist (when the path is not a glob pattern).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUpdated unit tests to reflect the new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nDuring the code generation, a `LocalRelation` often has a huge `Vector` object as `data`. In the simple example below, a `LocalRelation` has a Vector with 1000000 elements of `UnsafeRow`. \n\n```\nval numRows = 1000000\nval ds = (1 to numRows).toDS().persist()\nbenchmark.addCase(\"filter+reduce\") { iter =>\n  ds.filter(a => (a & 1) == 0).reduce(_ + _)\n}\n```\n\nAt `TreeNode.transformChildren`, all elements of the vector is unnecessarily iterated to check whether any children exist in the vector since `Vector` is Traversable. This part significantly increases code generation time.\n\nThis patch avoids this overhead by checking the number of children before iterating all elements; `LocalRelation` does not have children since it extends `LeafNode`.\n\nThe performance of the above example \n\n```\nwithout this patch\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_91-b14 on Mac OS X 10.11.5\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-5257U CPU @

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis refactoring make the public API simpler. Current version has the following problems\n1. Too many separate **public** classes for different location and consumer strategies. \n1. Each strategy has a separate `apply` and `create` methods for Scala and Java. \n2. ConsumerStrategy is interface, cannot add methods with breaking compatibility in the future.\n3. Using JavaConveters to wrap scala maps as java sometimes leads to the final map not being serializable. This broke serializability of strategies having maps.\n\nTo fix these, I have refactored the classes. Now `LocationStrategy` has static methods to create the appropriate strategy. E.g.\n\n```\nLocationStrategy.PreferBrokers()   // returns a LocationStrategy object, same API in scala and java\n```\n\nSimilarly,\n\n```\nConsumerStrategy.Subscribe(topics, params)  // returns a ConsumerStrategy object, same API in scala and java\n```\n\n1+2. This allows all the strategy classes to be hidden from public, less surface for incompatibility in the future. And same APIs for Java and Scala.\n3. In addition, both strategies have been implemented as abstract class in Java.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nModified unit tests.\n\nTODO: More unit tests to \n- [ ] Check serializability of each strategy\n- [ ] Call scala API of each strategy

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe commented lines failed scala 2.10 build. This is because of change in behavior of case classes between 2.10 and 2.11. In scala 2.10, if companion object of a case class has explicitly defined apply(), then the implicit apply method is not generated. In scala 2.11 it is generated. Hence, the lines compile fine in 2.11 but not in 2.10. \n\nThis simply comments the tests to fix broken build. Correct solution is pending.\n","created_at":"2016-06-30T08:01:59Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T10:08:02Z","closed_at":"2016-06-30T10:08:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7f4e52686f94e246b17ad0e118c803c47374af02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c9a74e764e9227d9389f1b037b112b145bc8de8","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-12177","ref":"SPARK-12177","sha":"4c9a74e764e9227d9389f1b037b112b145bc8de8","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch implements the 3 things specified in SPARK-16311:\n\n(1) Append a message to the FileNotFoundException and say that a workaround is to do explicitly metadata refresh.\n(2) Make metadata refresh work on temporary tables/views.\n(3) Make metadata refresh work on Datasets/DataFrames, by introducing a Dataset.refresh() method.\n\nAnd one additional small change:\n(4) Merge invalidateTable and refreshTable.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCreated a new test suite that creates a temporary directory and then deletes a file from it to verify Spark can read the directory once refresh is called.\n","created_at":"2016-06-30T04:54:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T06:39:23Z","closed_at":"2016-07-06T06:39:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"52276ae344935045b870c715a0d98d72e614584a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82f9bec79125ad3f1c4da504891a75adb5b33f2f","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:SPARK-16311","ref":"SPARK-16311","sha":"82f9bec79125ad3f1c4da504891a75adb5b33f2f","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors CSV data source to be consistent with JSON data source.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes classes `CSVParser` and introduces new classes `UnivocityParser` and `UnivocityGenerator` to be consistent with JSON data source (`JacksonParser`, `JacksonGenerator`). Also, `CSVRelation` is merged with `CSVFileFormat` just like `JsonFileFormat`.\r\n\r\nThis is a rough look of this change:\r\n\r\n**`CSVOptions`** - reading/writing settings that can be created from options from `CsvParser`.\r\n\r\n**`UnivocityGenerator`** - writing logics from `CSVRelation` and `CsvParser`\r\n\r\n**`UnivocityParser`** - parsing logics in `CSVTypeCast`, `CsvParser` and `CSVRelation`\r\n\r\n**`CSVFileFormat`** - `CSVOutputWriterFactory` and `CsvOutputWriter` in `CSVRelation`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the methods in classes have consistent arguments with JSON ones.\r\n  - `UnivocityGenerator` and `JacksonGenerator` \r\n    \r\n    ``` scala\r\n    private[csv] class UnivocityGenerator(\r\n        schema: StructType,\r\n        writer: Writer,\r\n        options: CSVOptions = new CSVOptions(Map.empty[String, String])) {\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    def write ...\r\n    def close ...\r\n    def flush ...\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    ``` scala\r\n    private[sql] class JacksonGenerator(\r\n       schema: StructType,\r\n       writer: Writer,\r\n       options: JSONOptions = new JSONOptions(Map.empty[String, String])) {\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    def write ...\r\n    def close ...\r\n    def flush ...\r\n    ```\r\n  - `UnivocityParser` resembles `JacksonParser`.\r\n\r\n    ```scala\r\n    private[csv] class UnivocityParser(\r\n        schema: StructType,\r\n        requiredSchema: StructType,\r\n        options: CSVOptions) extends Logging {\r\n    def this(schema: StructType, options: CSVOptions) = this(schema, schema, options)\r\n    ...\r\n    def parse(input: String)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    ```scala\r\n    class JacksonParser(\r\n        schema: StructType,\r\n        columnNameOfCorruptRecord: String,\r\n        options: JSONOptions) extends Logging {\r\n    ...\r\n    def parse(input: String)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  - `csv.CSVInferSchema` and `json.InferSchema`\r\n    \r\n    ``` scala\r\n    csv.CSVInferSchema.infer(csv: Dataset[String], caseSensitive: Boolean, options: CSVOptions)\r\n    \r\n    json.InferSchema.infer(json: RDD[String], columnNameOfCorruptRecord: String , configOptions: JSONOptions)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n- This PR also makes the classes put in together in a consistent manner with JSON.\r\n  - `CsvFileFormat`\r\n    \r\n    ``` scala\r\n    CsvFileFormat\r\n    CsvOutputWriter\r\n    ```\r\n  - `JsonFileFormat`\r\n    \r\n    ``` scala\r\n    JsonFileFormat\r\n    JsonOutputWriter\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nAlso, this re-write existing CSV parsing logics to re-use the row, separate parsing mode logic/convering logics and etc.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover this.\r\n","created_at":"2016-06-30T03:54:29Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:44:51Z","closed_at":"2017-01-06T14:31:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1a26d26cad1236f1de85d898761e43dd58999c49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13988/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13988/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13988/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c6666dba3ae76034c95bc31bfcf97c458c59be9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16101","ref":"SPARK-16101","sha":"4c6666dba3ae76034c95bc31bfcf97c458c59be9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark silently drops exceptions during file listing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current tests assumes that `impurity.calculate()` returns the variance correctly. It should be better to make the tests independent of this assumption. In other words verify that the variance computed equals the variance computed manually on a small tree.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe patch is a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nChange the access level of the `predict` method in all ML predictors and `predictProbability` in probabilistic classifiers from protected/private to public. \n## Why?\n\nPlease refer to the [JIRA ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16198) for more details on the experiment performed and why this is a good idea. \n\n**Summary:** The transform method of predictors in spark.ml has a relatively high latency when predicting single instances or small batches, which is mainly due to the overhead introduced by DataFrame operations. For a text classification task on the RCV1 datatset, changing the access level of the low-level `predict` method from protected to public and using it to make predictions reduced the latency of single predictions by three to four folds and that of batches by 50%. While the `transform` method is flexible and sufficient for general usage, exposing the low-level `predict` method to the public API can benefit many applications that require low-latency response. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAll the current tests for predictors passed.\n","created_at":"2016-06-29T19:16:52Z","updated_at":"2016-07-07T20:57:40Z","closed_at":"2016-07-07T20:57:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81e6d8aeaed746ce0363809aacddb406765d8bf3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13980/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13980/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13980/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02eced879f603736b24be5e50de1d966e992800c","head":{"label":"hazimehh:lowlatency","ref":"lowlatency","sha":"02eced879f603736b24be5e50de1d966e992800c","user":{"login":"hazimehh","id":11324150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11324150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh","html_url":"https://github.com/hazimehh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61673651,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTY3MzY1MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"hazimehh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hazimehh","id":11324150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzI0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11324150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh","html_url":"https://github.com/hazimehh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hazimehh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hazimehh/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUtils.terminateProcess should `destroy()` first and only fall back to `destroyForcibly()` if it fails. It's kind of bad that we're force-killing executors -- and only in Java 8. See JIRA for an example of the impact: no shutdown\n\nWhile here: `Utils.waitForProcess` should use the Java 8 method if available instead of a custom implementation.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests, which cover the force-kill case, and Amplab tests, which will cover both Java 7 and Java 8 eventually. However I tested locally on Java 8 and the PR builder will try Java 7 here.\n","created_at":"2016-06-29T12:00:23Z","updated_at":"2016-07-11T21:01:50Z","closed_at":"2016-07-01T08:24:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f3dc2a42447d5b344bcaee1b8c7bb17ef8db6f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/50ee5b6dd27ffbb92ef83ff81885f8f5a04d4595","head":{"label":"srowen:SPARK-16182","ref":"SPARK-16182","sha":"50ee5b6dd27ffbb92ef83ff81885f8f5a04d4595","user":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17241201,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI0MTIwMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"srowen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"srowen","id":822522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/822522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen","html_url":"https://github.com/srowen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/srowen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/srowen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`MAX(COUNT(*))` is invalid since aggregate expression can't be nested within another aggregate expression. This case should be captured at analysis phase, but somehow sneaks off to runtime.\n\nThe reason is that when checking aggregate expressions in `CheckAnalysis`, a checking branch treats all expressions that reference no input attributes as valid ones.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch implements xpath_boolean expression for Spark SQL, a xpath function that returns true or false. The implementation is modelled after Hive's xpath_boolean, except that how the expression handles null inputs. Hive throws a NullPointerException at runtime if either of the input is null. This implementation returns null if either of the input is null.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCreated two new test suites. One for unit tests covering the expression, and the other for end-to-end test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current impl of vectorized hashmap does not support null-value keys for nullable data types.  This patch fix the problem by adding `generateFindOrInsertWithNullable()` method in `VectorizedHashMapGenerator.scala`, which code-generates another version of `findOrInsert` that handles null-value keys. \n\nWe need null support so the aggregate logic does not have to fallback to BytesToBytesMap. This would also us to remove BytesToBytesMap completely.\n\n**Note that this patch does degrade query performance when there are no nulls.** Because the vectorized hashmap now contains null-value keys, we need to perform more null checks when comparing key values, i.e., in `equals`. In the future, we might use two levels of vectorized hashmap, with the first level only dealing non-null values, and second level dealing any values.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo additional test is added. A simple benchmark test is included to show the performance gain.\n","created_at":"2016-06-29T01:36:33Z","updated_at":"2016-07-27T22:09:28Z","closed_at":"2016-07-27T22:09:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8b2469bf0708cbcb4925d04c5f6eab83af454bc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13960/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13960/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13960/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/95abd4f2718556238fbccd9433f18af45dd457f6","head":{"label":"ooq:spt_nullable_in_vhm","ref":"spt_nullable_in_vhm","sha":"95abd4f2718556238fbccd9433f18af45dd457f6","user":{"login":"ooq","id":5876435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzY0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5876435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq","html_url":"https://github.com/ooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44266813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDI2NjgxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ooq/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ooq","id":5876435,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzY0MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5876435?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq","html_url":"https://github.com/ooq","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ooq/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ooq/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current `findBestSplits` method creates an instance of `ImpurityCalculator` and `ImpurityStats` for every possible split and feature in the search for the bestSplit. Every instance of `ImpurityCalculator` creates an array of size `statsSize` which is unnecessary and take a non-negligible amount of time. This pull request tackles this problem by the following technique.\n1. Remove the `impurityCalculator` instantiation for every possible split and feature. Replace this by a `calculateGain` method for each impurity that computes the gain directly from the `allStats` attribute of the `DTStatsAggregator` which holds all the necessary information. \n2. Replace returning an instance of `ImpurityStats` for every possible split and feature with just the information gain returned from the `calculateGain` method since the gain is sufficient to calculate the `bestSplit`. Just return an instance of `ImpurityStats` once for the `bestSplit` \n3. Remove the not-so-useful `calculateImpurityStats` method. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nSince this is a performance improvement, tests are necessary. Here are the improvements for a `RandomForestRegressor` with `maxDepth` set to 30, `subSamplingRate` set to 1 and `maxBins` set to 20 on synthetic data. The timings were calculated locally and the mean of 3 attempts were taken.\n\n| n_trees | n_samples | n_features | time in master | total time in this branch |\n| --- | :-: | --: | --: | --: |\n| 1 |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n1. Addition of `--driver-jre` flag to `SparkSubmitArguments`\n2. Now when `--driver-jre` is specified to `SparkSubmit` and it is connecting to a YARN master, the driver will zip up a copy of its in-use JRE and ship it to the YARN cluster as part of `spark.yarn.dist.archives`. Then by setting `spark.executorEnv.JAVA_HOME` and `spark.appMasterEnv.JAVA_HOME` to point to their local copies, use of specific versions of Java can be had even on YARN clusters that do not have those versions pre-installed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCompiled the Spark examples with Java 8, did a Java 8 `spark-submit --driver-jre` of `SparkPi`  to a Java 7 YARN cluster, executors and AM used Java 8 without issue. Running without shipping the JRE results in errors due to Java version differences.\n","created_at":"2016-06-28T20:56:00Z","updated_at":"2016-07-18T14:44:53Z","closed_at":"2016-07-18T14:44:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7b75f41e330532f43471000e0bfd04046665e33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92afe26e3b30a842037af0266e133267c0ca17ea","head":{"label":"a10y:master","ref":"master","sha":"92afe26e3b30a842037af0266e133267c0ca17ea","user":{"login":"a10y","id":332583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjU4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y","html_url":"https://github.com/a10y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39734055,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTczNDA1NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"a10y/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"a10y","id":332583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMjU4Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/332583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y","html_url":"https://github.com/a10y","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a10y/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/a10y/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis pull request adds the functionality to enable accessing worker and application UI through master UI itself. Thus helps in accessing SparkUI when running spark cluster in closed networks e.g. Kubernetes. Cluster admin needs to expose only spark master UI and rest of the UIs can be in the private network, master UI will reverse proxy the connection request to corresponding resource. It adds the path for workers/application UIs as\n\nWorkerUI: <http/https>://master-publicIP:<port>/target/workerID/\nApplicationUI: <http/https>://master-publicIP:<port>/target/appID/\n\nThis makes it easy for users to easily protect the Spark master cluster access by putting some reverse proxy e.g. https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThe functionality has been tested manually and there is a unit test too for testing access to worker UI with reverse proxy address.\n\n@pwendell @bomeng @BryanCutler can you please review it, thanks.\n","created_at":"2016-06-28T19:03:30Z","updated_at":"2016-09-09T00:22:29Z","closed_at":"2016-09-09T00:22:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e409aecc70ce044163ab60c36269f113bab5d60","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9f6862ed579cf4edc965e1a9835a79d6aa4c6d0b","head":{"label":"gurvindersingh:rproxy","ref":"rproxy","sha":"9f6862ed579cf4edc965e1a9835a79d6aa4c6d0b","user":{"login":"gurvindersingh","id":186077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjA3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh","html_url":"https://github.com/gurvindersingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":59764777,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1OTc2NDc3Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"gurvindersingh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gurvindersingh","id":186077,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjA3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/186077?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh","html_url":"https://github.com/gurvindersingh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gurvindersingh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gurvindersingh/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis extends SPARK-15860 to include metrics for the actual bytecode size of janino-generated methods. They can be accessed in the same way as any other codahale metric, e.g.\n\n```\nscala> org.apache.spark.metrics.source.CodegenMetrics.METRIC_GENERATED_CLASS_BYTECODE_SIZE.getSnapshot().getValues()\nres7: Array[Long] = Array(532, 532, 532, 542, 1479, 2670, 3585, 3585)\n\nscala> org.apache.spark.metrics.source.CodegenMetrics.METRIC_GENERATED_METHOD_BYTECODE_SIZE.getSnapshot().getValues()\nres8: Array[Long] = Array(5, 5, 5, 5, 10, 10, 10, 10, 15, 15, 15, 38, 63, 79, 88, 94,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n@koertkuipers identified the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13727/ changed the behavior of `load` API. After the change, the `load` API does not add the value of `path` into the `options`. Thank you!\n\nThis PR is to add the option `path` back to `load()` API in `DataFrameReader`, if and only if users specify one and only one `path` in the `load` API. For example, users can see the `path` option after the following API call,\n\n``` Scala\nspark.read\n  .format(\"parquet\")\n  .load(\"/test\")\n```\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nImplementations of strategies for resilient block replication for different resource managers that replicate the 3-replica strategy used by HDFS, where the first replica is on an executor, the second replica within the same rack as the executor and a third replica on a different rack. \nThe implementation involves providing two pluggable classes, one running in the driver that provides topology information for every host at cluster start and the second prioritizing a list of peer BlockManagerIds.\n\nThe prioritization itself can be thought of an optimization problem to find a minimal set of peers that satisfy certain objectives and replicating to these peers first. The objectives can be used to express richer constraints over and above HDFS like 3-replica strategy. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch was tested with unit tests for storage, along with new unit tests to verify prioritization

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we create a SparkSession at the Python side, it is possible that a SparkContext has been created. For this case, we need to set configs of the SparkSession builder to the Scala SparkContext's SparkConf (we need to do so because conf changes on a active Python SparkContext will not be propagated to the JVM side). Otherwise, we may create a wrong SparkSession (e.g. Hive support is not enabled even if enableHiveSupport is called). \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew tests and manual tests.\n","created_at":"2016-06-27T20:43:23Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T14:56:53Z","closed_at":"2016-06-28T14:56:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f1f69577909e5476e8b2a7b7c40b39b7303c3d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13931/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13931/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13931/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/793afb91f5e573e40d78bb2aa8a9bf89154396f2","head":{"label":"yhuai:SPARK-16224","ref":"SPARK-16224","sha":"793afb91f5e573e40d78bb2aa8a9bf89154396f2","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1aa191e58e905f470f73663fc1c35f36e05e929a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache
