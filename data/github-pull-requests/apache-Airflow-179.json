tasks can be run even if the `dagrun` is queued. Task instances of queued `dagruns`\r\nshould only be run when the `dagrun` is in a running state. This PR makes sure `tis` of queued `dagruns`\r\nare not run thereby properly checking task concurrency.\r\n\r\nAlso, we check max_active_runs when parsing dag which is no longer needed since `dagruns`\r\nare created in `queued` state and the scheduler controls when to change the queued `dagruns`\r\nto running considering the max_active_runs.\r\nThis PR removes the checking of

we have a prolonged issue with flaky tests or Github runners\r\ninstabilities, our automated constraint and image refresh might\r\nnot work, so we might need to manually refresh the constraints\r\nand images. Documentation about that was in CONTRIBUTING.rst\r\nbut it is more appriate to keep it in ``dev`` as it only applies\r\nto committers.\r\n\r\nAlso during testing the parallell refresh without delays an error\r\nwas discovered  which prevented parallell check of random image\r\nhash during the build. This has been fixed and parallell\r\nimage cache building should work flawlessly now.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

providers operators/hooks reference contained only top-level list of\r\ngroups of providers, which make them less-usable than they could be as\r\nthe users did not see at this page links to particular

glance\" overview what is available.\r\n\r\nThis change improves that, removes the repeated multiple times\r\n\"operators and hooks\" which was kind of annoying, and increases\r\nthe TOC-level to 3

PR is result of responding to a number of questions and issues\r\nAirflow users had on Slack, Stack Overflow and GitHub issues.\r\n\r\nWhile the document was really helpful it did not address some of\r\nthe questions people had and it did not have enough examples, it also\r\ndid not warn people to avoid some of the common mistakes they\r\ncould make (such as using relative imports).\r\n\r\nThe sequence of the document has also been slightly improved.\r\nIt was not clear what the document was reallyh about as it had\r\nseveral independent chapters without logical sequence. Now the\r\ndocument starts with intro and explaining the options you have,\r\nexplaining in general how python loads packages and modules and\r\nthen going deper into the usual ways users will add code to\r\nAirflow, ending with description on how to prepare your custom\r\npackage (which logically follows the frequency of the ways users\r\nare adding code to Airflow).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of existing issue, reference it using one of the

using the following example dag, it currently fails with `You cannot pass naive datetimes` error.\r\nThis happens because `TimeSensorAsync` passes a `datetime.time` object while `DateTimeTrigger` expects\r\na `datetime.datetime` object. This PR fixes it by adding a new trigger object: ``TimeTrigger``.\r\n\r\nExample DAG:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import timedelta\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.sensors.time_sensor import TimeSensorAsync\r\nfrom airflow.utils import dates, timezone\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id='example_date_time_async_operator',\r\n    schedule_interval='0 0 * * *',\r\n    start_date=dates.days_ago(2),\r\n    dagrun_timeout=timedelta(minutes=60),\r\n    tags=['example', 'example2', 'async'],\r\n) as dag:\r\n\r\n    TimeSensorAsync(task_id=\"test-2\", target_time=timezone.time(22, 43, 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @andrewgodwin \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`DAG.create_dagrun()` has an weird behavior that when *all* of `run_id`, `execution_date`, and `run_type` are provided, the function would ignore the `run_id` argument and overwrite it by auto-generating a `run_id` with `DagRun.generate_run_id()`. This fix the logic to respect the explicit `run_id` value.\r\n\r\nI don't think any of the \"Airflow proper\" code would be affected by this, but the `dag_maker` fixture used in the test suite needs to be tweaked a bit to continue working.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

TaskReschedule had an existing FK to TaskInstance we had to move\r\nchange both of these at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis puts an explicit FK constraint between TaskInstance and DagRun,\r\nmeaning that we can remove a lot of \"find TIs without DagRun\" code in\r\nthe scheduler too, as that is no longer a possible situation.\r\n\r\nSince there is now an explicit foreign key between TaskInstance and\r\nDagRun, we can remove a lot of the \"cleanup\" code in the scheduler that\r\nwas dealing with this.\r\n\r\nThis PR is, sadly, unavoidably large as it changes a fundamental part of the Airflow system, the primary key of the TaskInstance table :(\r\n\r\nCloses  #17046\r\n\r\nRelated #16302, #17030\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

change implements lazy loading of individual hooks for providers\r\nmanager. First the hooks list is discovered by the manager when\r\nhooks are accessed, but the hooks are not immediately\r\nimported - the hooks initially keep just a callable that will\r\nbe used to retrieve the hook when first accessed.\r\n\r\nBesides listing details of all hooks, all Hooks are only imported when we\r\nwant to retrieve the list of available field behaviours and widgets\r\n(which only happens in webserver and should happen anyway whenever one\r\nof those are needed because they are all collectively used in the\r\nconnection view).\r\n\r\nIn the case when hooks are accessed in tasks\r\n(connection.get_hook()) only the individual Hooks are\r\nimported when accessed.\r\n\r\nThe change deprecates 'hook-class-names' json-schema and replaces it\r\nwith 'connection-types' because we need to know connection-type\r\nfor each HookClass name declaratively so that we can utilse\r\nit in connection.get_hook() mehtod (otherwise we do not know\r\nwhich Hooks conrrespond to which connection type without importing\r\nthem).\r\n\r\nThe change is backwards compatible. It adds deprecation\r\nwarnings in case providers use the 'hook-class-names' property\r\nonly and log warnings in case it provides both `hook-class-names`\r\nand `connection-types` but there are inconsistencies between\r\nthose.\r\n\r\nPart of this change is also to fix some inconsistencies found\r\nwhen all hooks were added to connection-types arrays, which\r\nmake potetntially backwards-incompatible changes to Google Provider\r\nwhere some hooks were useing `google_cloud_default` name for\r\ndefault_connection_type, but they were in fact using different,\r\nspecialized Hook.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

recently published a 2.0.0 release which removed support for Python 2.7. `google-auth` now requires Python >=3.6. No other breaking changes were made. You can see the full list of changes [here](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-python/commit/560cf1ed02a900436c5d9e0a0fb3f94b5fd98c55).\r\n\r\nI am opening PRs to expand google-auth version ranges for packages that meet either of the following criteria:\r\n* Package has >10,000 monthly downloads as of June 2021\r\n* Package is owned by a Google team\r\n\r\n`google-auth` is a dependency of many different libraries that interact with Google APIs. Increasing the time and number of packages with compatible pins on `google-auth` lowers the chance end developers who use multiple libraries will see dependency conflicts. \r\n\r\nIf possible, please do not require `google-auth>=2.0.0` or `google-api-core>=2.0.0` until https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python/issues/10566 is resolved, as that will further reduce the likelihood of diamond dependency conflicts.\r\n\r\nGooglers, see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1euAvUsia_4zf98lNvpwA3K0o2b4y5Xr9xAkyzCnIMzQ/edit) for more information.\r\n\r\nGiven the number of google-cloud-* packages this library pins directly I also bumped the pin on `google-api-core` to < 3.\r\n\r\n**Constraints files**: I looked at https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pinned-constraint-files but am not quite sure what that means for this change.

is a long-overdue change for CI workflows. Since we are building\r\nimages in a separate workflow, the `CI Builds` name of the workflow\r\nwas - first of all misleading, and secondly - too long. The workflow\r\nnames displayed in the GitHub UI contains the workflow name as prefix\r\nso having as short as possible name is an advantage.\r\n\r\nThe `Tests` names seems to be appropriate because this is in fact\r\nwhat we do in this workflow.\r\n\r\nThe change updates the name of workflow as well as documentation\r\nthat referred to it and fixes a few inconsistencies found in\r\nnames of the `Build Image` -> `Build Images` workflow.\r\n\r\nThe sequence diagrams showing the CI workflow have been also\r\nregenerated with the new name (thanks to mermaid it was super-easy)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

`heartbeat` was putting in a sleep in which isn't necessary/useful in tests, where we want it to run as quick as possible.\n\nThe sleep has been kept in \"normal\" mode as otherwise the status output (`[backfill progress] | finished run %s of %s |` etc.) will be essentially spammed, rather than only being printed every few seconds.\n\nThis makes the tests/jobs/ run in about 20s (vs 120s without
