prepare template api to seed/prepare a template only on a given primary storage. Currently, the prepare template api will seed/prepare a given template on all the primary storage pools in a zone. If however, a user wishes to prepare a template only a particular storage pool, it isn't possible. Updated the api to take storage pool id as an optional parameter. If the pool id is provided then the template is prepared only on the given primary storage pool.\n\nFollowing scenarios were tested. 1) Prepared a template with out the storage pool id. The template was seeded on all the available pools in the given zone. 2) Prepared a template with storage pool id as a parameter in the api. The template was seeded only on the given primary storage

PR contains some refactoring of the Python code used by the redundant routers and also a fix for the intermittent problem when running the rVPC component tests.\n\nTo summarise it:\n- If the KeepaloiveD configuration file changes, restart the service instead of reloading it.\n- Since we are configuring KeepaliveD/VRRP in no-preemptive mode, we no longer need priorities. As a matter of fact, the Management Server was not sending priorities to the routers anymore. The value used in the old configuration was defaulted to 99 in the Python code.\n- KeepaliveD and ConntractD, once configured in a router, will have a cronjob that will run on reboot. So, the services will be restarted without the need to wait for the management server to send some configuration and force a restart.\n- Installing KeepaliveD from Wheezy-Backports in order to have a newer version available.\n\nI already squashed few commits of this PR so we wouldn't have to go through simple fixes/typos that happened during the tryouts. When opening the commits for review please note that the commit messages also contain the messages of the squashed commits.\n\nAdding the cronjob to restart the KeepaliveD service on reboot helped to get a 60% success rate with the tests. Before that, the tests were failing very often: 4 out of 5 times.\n\nI then added the \"restart\" when configuration changes instead of \"reload\". Once the change was applied, I successfully executed the tests 13 times. That gives confidence.\n\nTests can be executed with the following command:\n\nnosetests --with-marvin --marvin-config=[your_configuration_file] -s -a tags=advanced,required_hardware=true component/test_vpc_redundant.py\n\nSince there were changes on marvin/base.py - in the previous PR, you will need to build/upgrade your Marvin installation.\n\n@DaanHoogland @bhaisaab @remibergsma, could you please have a look at this PR?\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","created_at":"2015-07-14T13:04:17Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T11:31:01Z","closed_at":"2015-07-16T11:16:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dbeb47f6a8bd43e75e660fddd9395422d36c604e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/587/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/587/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/587/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/f4f4d11945d27b8554cb65bf37c8045a81d88e66","head":{"label":"schubergphilis:fix/CLOUDSTACK-8616","ref":"fix/CLOUDSTACK-8616","sha":"f4f4d11945d27b8554cb65bf37c8045a81d88e66","user":{"login":"schubergphilis","id":864482,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg2NDQ4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/864482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis","html_url":"https://github.com/schubergphilis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a1ff7e24f334e3e98cb8e6c58b9295b7215d2be7","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

changes to test_security_group.py test suite to support EIP\n1. In case of a basic zone with EIP/ELB capability vm will have two ip addresses one from public ip range and another one from guest ip range.\n   vm creation method in base.py returns vm ip address which is part of guest ip range as the vm.ssh.ipaddress if we don't pass mode to it. So access to vms with that ip address would not be successful. Made changes to handle this\n   2.vm public address is associated with Netscaler. So even if we don't allow ping traffic in security groups applied to vm, ping will be successful. Skipping ping test in case the zone is enabled with EIP/ELB\n   3.Removing default rules from security groups except what is needed for that test.\n# Test Results:\n\nTest ingress rules for specific IP set ... === TestName: test_ingress_rules_specific_IP_set | Status : SUCCESS ===\nok\nTest revoke ingress rule ... === TestName: test_01_revokeIngressRule | Status : SUCCESS ===\nok\nTest ingress

ensure that setting a high timeout value for snapshot backup operation will not affect vCenter connections made for any other operations besides volume snapshot, split the existing vCenter session timeout configuration into two configurations,\n1. To tune timeout value for CS's session vCenter during snapshot backup operation - 'vmware.snapshot.backup.session.timeout' (new; default: 20 minutes)\n2. For all other operations - 'vmware.vcenter.session.timeout' (existing; default: 20 minutes)\n\nAdditional change -\nUsers could potentially run into a timeout issue while trying to snapshot large VMs. There is a timeout for async-jobs that ensures that any job that has been in process for too long is cancelled by CS MS. This timeout is configurable using a global configuration ‘job.cancel.threshold.minutes’ and it defaults to 1 hour.\nNow for large volumes even though users configure other snapshot timeout values (‘vmware.snapshot.backup.session.timeout’ and ‘backup.snapshot.wait‘) to a very high value, the snapshot operation will still fail because the job will be cancelled in 1 hour.\nHence proposing a configuration that will allow admins to separate out the job cancellation timeout for ‘volume snapshot’ jobs from other vm work jobs - 'volume.snapshot.job.cancel.threshold'.\n","created_at":"2015-07-06T06:31:59Z","updated_at":"2017-05-17T13:38:44Z","closed_at":"2017-05-17T13:38:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f54c27ff227b82c5e60ed28b308a0422302b796","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584073207,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzMyMDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:vmware","name":"component:vmware","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":602283376,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDIyODMzNzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/status:needs-work","name":"status:needs-work","color":"ff3030","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/562/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/562/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/562/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/c8c9d81b0c2f08f506e828453efbed7911d9a517","head":{"label":"likitha:CLOUDSTACK-8612","ref":"CLOUDSTACK-8612","sha":"c8c9d81b0c2f08f506e828453efbed7911d9a517","user":{"login":"likitha","id":1097805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha","html_url":"https://github.com/likitha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22669343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjY2OTM0Mw==","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"likitha/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"likitha","id":1097805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc4MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha","html_url":"https://github.com/likitha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/likitha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/likitha/cloudstack","description":"Mirror

Once CS has opened a session to a virtual router and executed a script in the router, it waits indefinitely till the session either times-out or the exit status of the remote process is available. But it is possible that an EOF is reached by the process in the router and the router never set the exit status.\n\nReferences -\n1. Some servers never send the exist status, or occasionally \"forget\" to do so (http://grepcode.com/file/repo1.maven.org/maven2/org.jvnet.hudson/trilead-ssh2/build212-hudson-1/com/trilead/ssh2/ChannelCondition.java).\n2. Get the exit code/status from the remote command - if available. Be careful - not all server implementations return this value -

seems that the class \"XcpOssResource\"  was forgotten during the evolution of the ACS.\n It was removed a few methods that were already coded properly in its\nparent class\n“com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.CitrixResourceBase”. It was\nalso removed some methods that seemed to cause weird behaviors. The\nmethods removed/fixed are detailed as follows:\n• com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.XcpOssResource.fillHostInfo(Connection,\nStartupRoutingCommand) – it was removed, because it always added the\nstring “, hvm” to the host capabilities. Therefore, if one uses XCP\nhypervisor it could cause a lot of trouble when deploying HVM virtual\nmachines in an environment that has PV and HVM clusters. The method is\nalready properly coded in parent class. \n• com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.XcpOssResource.launchHeartBeat(Connection)\n– It was removed. It was not performing anything and always returns a\ntrue value. The method of parent class is properly coded and works for\nXCP environments. The heartbeat plugin exists in XCP environment.\n• com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.XcpOssResource.initializeLocalSR(Connection)\n– it was removed. The method of the parent class works properly for XCP\nenvironments.\n• com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.XcpOssResource.createPatchVbd(Connection,\nString, VM) – It was removed. This method causes a bug in XCP\nenvironments, because of its half-implementation, it was not possible to\nmigrate system VMs. The parent class implementation works properly for\nXCP.\n• com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.XcpOssResource.execute(NetworkUsageCommand)\n– removed, hence it was already coded into parent class and its\nrespective wrappers\n(“com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.wrapper.xcp.XcpServerNetworkUsageCommandWrapper”). \nBTW: I noticed that the class XcpServerNetworkUsageCommandWrapper and\nXenServer56NetworkUsageCommandWrapper are almost the same, with the\nexception that XenServer56NetworkUsageCommandWrapper deals with VPC. I\nbelieve that those wrappers could be converted into one, and moved to\nparent. I am not doing that here because I do not have a XCP environment\nwith advanced networking to test it. \n• com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.XcpOssResource.executeRequest(Command)\n– removed, hence it is not needed anymor.\n• com.cloud.hypervisor.xenserver.resource.XcpOssResource.execute(StopCommand)\n– I did not understand that method. It seemed weird and its removal did\nnot change any behavior of the environment I tested it with.\n\nI strongly encourage you guys to review the classes XcpServerNetworkUsageCommandWrapper and XenServer56NetworkUsageCommandWrapper, I think they can be merged. I also believe that the VPN code should be execute to XCP, which today is not happening.

changes in this PR will cover the following:\n- Make sure the new password replaces the old one in the queue\n- Updated the patch files for XenServer\n- Updated the script path on LibvirtComputing class\n- Adding update_host_passwd to VRScripts\n- Add implementation to CitrixUpdateHostPasswordCommandWrapper\n- Improve testUpdateHostPasswordCommand() unit test on CitrixRequestWrapperTest\n- Adding update_host_passwd.sh script\n- Adding the host IP address as an instance variable on UpdateHostPasswordCommand\n- Improving the Unit Test (LibvirtComputingResourceTest) to get it covering the new code\n- Make sure doUpdateHostPassword() doesn't get called if flag is set to false\n- Do not update XenServer hosts if the cluster ID is not informed\n\nTest Environment:\n\nXenServer cluster: 2 hosts\n1 KVM host + KVM Agent 4.6.0-SNAPSHOT built based on the code changes\nManagement Server running on CentOS 7.1\nShared Storage\nCloudmonkey\n\n:: Update Single Xen Host ::\n\nupdate hostpassword hostid=ce516ca6-9294-46c8-995c-406672aecf3f username=root password=admin update_passwd_on_host=true\n\nResult: Error 431: Single host update is not supported by XenServer hypervisors. Please try again informing the Cluster ID.\n\n:: Update Xen Cluster ::\n\nupdate hostpassword clusterid=479cd3f1-2f94-4ae9-b1bb-08be1da1b460 username=root update_passwd_on_host=true password=admin\n\nResult: success = true\n\nSuccessfully SSH into both hosts with new password\n\n:: Update Single KVM Host ::\n\nupdate hostpassword hostid=5683cf21-6cb0-4ed0-8498-f77411e89e9a username=root update_passwd_on_host=true password=admin\n\nResult: success = true\n\nSuccessfully SSH into KVM host with new password\n\nI also reverted the passwords of the hosts to the original, all worked fine.\n\nThe \"update_passwd_on_host\" parameter is not required and is defaulted to \"false\", which means if operators want to proceed as before, updating only the database and the hosts manually that will be fine.\n\nIn case we face problems with the DB update, nothing will change - not even the hosts. In case we are updating a host and it fails due to connection problem, for example, the DB changes will not be rolled back. That's not okay, but I want to fix the consistence in a separate issue, since it would be out of scope for our sprint - which finished next week.\n\n@remibergsma: could you have a look at that  before you go on holidays? :) \n@DaanHoogland, @karuturi  and @bhaisaab, your comments are also appreciated\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nCheers,\nWilder\n","created_at":"2015-07-04T14:08:55Z","updated_at":"2015-07-06T14:18:32Z","closed_at":"2015-07-06T14:18:32Z","merged_at":"2015-07-06T14:18:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"a4dd5846caae64f2d8bd46703fd7beeca0cecda9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/559/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/559/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/issues/559/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/statuses/e348e76eee60d11eecf4c127cc2c9d03a72a96cb","head":{"label":"schubergphilis:improvement/CLOUDSTACK-8607","ref":"improvement/CLOUDSTACK-8607","sha":"e348e76eee60d11eecf4c127cc2c9d03a72a96cb","user":{"login":"schubergphilis","id":864482,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg2NDQ4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/864482?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis","html_url":"https://github.com/schubergphilis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schubergphilis/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5d9f851deb1a12e4a07297353ea715f9cf13e677","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":9759448,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzU5NDQ4","name":"cloudstack","full_name":"apache/cloudstack","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack","description":"Apache

combined commit because otherwise it would not make sense.\n\nIf I commit the fixes alone there is not test to verify them\nIf I commit the tests alone it will not work because it found bugs\n\nSo both together\n\nThe test test_vpc_redundant.py is added (requires hardware) together with the following fixes.  \n1.  Fix incorrect SNAT configuration (was adding SNAT to interfaces not marked as nat in the json config). \n2.  Fix interface used for keepalived multicast traffic to be lowest guest i/f.  This stops some unnecessary keepalived flip-flops\n3.  If all nat rules are removed and re-added public interfaces would stay down (because master status does not change and CS deletes the interface)\n4.  Small change to Marvin to allow a test to change the retries count (is downwardly compatible).\n5.  A couple of pep8 things.\n6.  Improved locking during master/backup transitions.\n\nThe test still very occasionally fails with a (correct) double master detection.  When I have worked out why, I will produce another PR.

there,\n\nThe motivation behind the refactor of the NiciraNvpResource class was to decouple the execute of the commands, which was handled into several private methods in the class.\n\nWith the refactor, we were able to decouple all the commands by wrapping them with another class. The extra classes are declared with the ResourceWrapper annotation, which makes possible to get all the classes loaded into a map inside the implementation of the  RequestWrapper class, in that case the NiciraNvpRequestWrapper.\n\nNew tests were added in order to increase test coverage. The current status is:\n- Resource package: 86.7% coverage\n- Utils package: 95.1% coverage\n- Wrapper package: 97.5% coverage\n\nIn addition, the previous retry mechanism has been improved. Instead of having an instance variable to control the retries and the extra methods with the number of retries passed as parameter, we now have a Map which holds the commands and the number of retry. Once the number of retries reaches ZERO, the given command is removed from the Map.\n\nAn issue has been created in order to follow up with this refactor: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CLOUDSTACK-8590\n\nThe changes do not affect the behaviour of the NiciraNvpResource. As a proof of that, all the existing tests worked without any change. This is a pure structural change on the code.  \n\nThis PR consists of 11 commits. I tried to combine the work on the command wrappers, retry mechanism, unit tests and general
