#6993 introduced automatic cleanup of container images pushed to\r\na container registry.

post-commit suite is configured to also include pre-commit tests. However, in Jenkins we run pre-commits separately from post-commits, and in all cases when a language post-commit suite runs, the pre-commit is also run separate (in PR, on merge, cron schedule). So, it makes sense to separate the targets. This will free up resources and give a faster signal on post-commit suites as they are doing less work.\r\n\r\nBased on data from this PR, here's how the post-commit timings from compare to recent runs against master:\r\n\r\n* [Python](https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python_Verify_PR/254/): 52 mins, down from [~80 mins](https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python_Verify/buildTimeTrend), **35% reduction**\r\n* [Go](https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Go_GradleBuild_PR/35/): 11 mins, down from [~13 mins](https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Go_GradleBuild/buildTimeTrend), **15% reduction**\r\n* [Java](https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Java_GradleBuild_PR/218/): 102 mins, down from [~115 mins](https://builds.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Java_GradleBuild/buildTimeTrend), **11% reduction**\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

time parsing functions among SQL tests. \r\n\r\nThe benefits are:\r\n1. `new Datetime()` way looks too long in IDE and makes code hard to read.\r\n2. In tests, if data is written into query (e.g. `\"SELECT DATE '2018-01-30'\"`), then that string can be copied to parsing functions for query result match (compared to write a `new Datetime`.\r\n3. Reduce confusion of with/without timezone when creating a new Joda Datetime. \r\n4. Well formatted datetime string is more readable.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

BigQuery clustering: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/clustered-tables.\r\n\r\nAs this is related to BigQuery TimePartitioning, I based my implementation on this

clustering. If needed I can write some if someone points me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThis is my first feature PR, so I'm eager to get some proper feedback.\r\n@jkff, @reuvenlax as you committed & authored time partitioning, can you have a look?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nWout\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

is flaky at least on ES6. From time to time, the expected number of splits is higher that the actual number of sources after the split. But both expected and actual number of splits are determined using `Math.ceil(indexSize/desiredBundleSize)`. My guess is that the difference is due to `indexSize` not being the same between the time when expected value is calculated and the time when it is actually estimated in split. This can have 2 reasons:\r\n1- index size in ES has a part of random (says Elastic dev team)\r\n2- refresh of the index was not finished when split is done.\r\n=> This PR addresses point 2 because there is nothing we can do about point 1: test util requests to ES are issued **synchronously** and they specify `refresh=true` which causes a refresh to be done but I'm not sure that this refresh is synchronous. Instead use `refresh=wait` so that the request waits for the index refresh before returning.\r\n\r\nR: @timrobertson100 \r\nCC: @kennknowles \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

PR enables running Nexmark jobs from PRs using Phrase Triggering. \r\n\r\nPhrase triggered Jobs: \r\n - run exactly the same option sets as the PostCommit ones\r\n - have separate jenkins jobs definitions\r\n - publish results to \"nexmark_PRs\" dataset whereas the original jobs use \"nexmark\" dataset. Thanks to that there is no \"data pollution\"\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I created a special \"Nexmark Builder\" that encapsulates all tasks common to Nexmark. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that I checked if the jobs run as they should, I didn't want to touch original jobs code yet give everyone time to spot any differences between the jobs (original/phrase triggered) if they occur. This can be easily done later in a separate PR by replacing the gradle goals code from origial jobs with the following line (example for direct runner): \r\n\r\n```\r\nNexmark.standardJob(delegate, Nexmark.Runner.DIRECT, JOB_SPECIFIC_OPTIONS, Nexmark.TriggeringContext.POST_COMMIT)\r\n```\r\nIf you think this should be done now, let me know.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\nIt will help us expedite review of your Pull Request if you tag someone (e.g. `@username`) to look at it.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status

adds a specialized implementation for global top that greatly reduces\r\nthe number of compares required in the (single) reducer.\r\nAlso uses heapq rather than repeated buffer + sort + truncate.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation doesn't accept side keywords and arguments, but these\r\n(if any) are much more efficiently passed via a closure of the comparison\r\noperator than on processing every single element.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title
