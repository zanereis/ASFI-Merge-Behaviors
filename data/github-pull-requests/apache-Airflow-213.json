@mik-laj ,\r\n\r\nHere we go for the external redis support ! (Closes #11705)\r\n\r\n_NB: the first commit is the same as in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/12009_\r\n\r\nI'll test this final version in the real world on Monday ; I am opening the PR to check that we are on the good path.\r\n\r\n**Description from the main commit:**\r\n\r\nThe main objective here is to support the use\r\nof an external redis instance in the helm chart.\r\nThe values 'data.brokerUrl' and\r\n'data.brokerUrlSecretName' are added and\r\ntemplates are updated.\r\n\r\nThis support is added with no breaking changes\r\n(hopefully); only the redis.brokerURLSecretName\r\nvalue is removed, but it wasn't actually used in\r\nthe chart.\r\n\r\nExtensive tests for the redis related part of this\r\nchart are also added (including runtime checks on\r\nthe values).\r\n\r\nDocs also updated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License

issue #10988 suspects that there's a dependency on side-effects from other tests.\r\nHowever, the test itself seems pretty hermetic, creating a new randomly-named temp directory every time.\r\nMy guess is that there is a case where the randomly-generated name contains one of the ignored tokens.\r\nFor example, probability of a random 8-character name containing `\"not\"` is roughly `6 / 37^3` ~ 0.01%.\r\nIn this case, all files will be wrongfully ignored because we use the absolute path to perform the pattern matching.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nUse the relative path to perform the pattern

of: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/11925\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nI started working on displaying deprecation warnings in Web UI, so I will explain a bit what it looks like in the context of Airflow 1.10 and 2.0.\r\n\r\nIn Airflow 1.10.13, we have the `airflow upgrade-check` command with a specific set of rules that are detected and displayed in the CLI for the user. These rules detect breaking changes and things that were deprecated in Airflow 2.0, but that might work. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nThe code below works on Airflow 1.10 and 2.0:\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.operators.jdbc_operator import JdbcOperator\r\n```\r\nIn Airflow 2.0, we will display a deprecation warning to the user that this code will not work in the next release, but the user does not have easy access to this warning. This message only appears in CLI, but access to CLI in some environments is limited. Not every user has access, but every user should see this deprecation warning.\r\n\r\nThis is not based on a specific set of rules, but we are using the standard Python library.\r\nhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warning-categories\r\n```python\r\n        if region is None:\r\n            warnings.warn(\r\n                \"Default region value `global` will be deprecated. Please, provide region value.\",\r\n                DeprecationWarning,\r\n                stacklevel=2,\r\n            )\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/41bf172c1dc75099f4f9d8b3f3350b4b1f523ef9/airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/dataproc.py#L482-L487\r\n\r\nIn the long run, this may mean that users will not have to focus specifically on migrating to the next release but will be able to update each release smoothly.  When users update the provider package, they will have some new warning that they will likely fix during regular maintenance. When they have no errors, they will be able to update to a newer version safely.\r\n\r\nWe can use this to display DAG writing recommendations. For now, it detects database queries during parsing the DAG so we can suggest a more optimal solution - Jiinja.\r\nFor example, the following code is not perfect. \r\n```python\r\n    email_summary = email_operator.EmailOperator(\r\n        task_id='email_summary',\r\n        to=models.Variable.get('email'),\r\n        subject='Sample BigQuery notify data ready',\r\n        html_content=\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/f89ac82ea18a08398cc54762c638c686c6f938fa/composer/workflows/bq_notify.py#L145-L149\r\nWe should use Jinja to limit the number of database queries.\r\n```python\r\n    email_summary = email_operator.EmailOperator(\r\n        task_id='email_summary',\r\n        to='{{ var.value.email }}',\r\n        subject='Sample BigQuery notify data ready',\r\n        html_content=\"\"\"\r\n```\r\nFor now, this is exclusive to Airflow 2.0, and we can think of cherry-picking this change, but it is a separate effort and not necessarily needed because we have the airflow upgrade-check command.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

now, when we are using the CLI parser in LocalTaskJob and executor, having to re-create the parser each time adds a noticeable overhead for quick tasks -- by caching this we save 0.07s\n\n(I know that doesn't sound like much, but for an `echo true` BashOperator task that takes it from 0.25s to 0.19s - i.e. it cuts the time down by about 20%!)\n\nWhen coupled with #11956 this makes an ungodly difference to task run time for large dags with many short DAGs, more so than it looks like individually -- we've seen total \"task lag\" for a DAG (time between end date of one task and start date of next) go from 21 seconds down to 0.7 seconds - varies quite a lot based on number of tasks and DAG structure (linear vs binary tree etc.) -- but it always helps.\n\nUsing CLI parser inside LocalTaskJob and the Executor is a bit of a hack, but this is a _very_ easy fix for the speed it gives!\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

the Celery process uses a preforking execution model, and much of Airflow is not loaded, each and every task execution needs to load some or most of these modules.\n\nThese modules add about 0.3s to _every_ task run time, which is nothing for a long task, but significant if you want to run a lot of short tasks very quickly.\n\nThese modules were discovered by running with `PYTHONPROFILEIMPORTTIME=1` environment variable set and looking at what was imported and expensive.\n\n\n<!--\nThank you for contributing!

This PR Standardises the callable signatures in `PythonOperator`, `PythonSensor`, `ExternalTaskSensor`, `SimpleHttpOperator` and `HttpSensor`.\r\n- The callable facilities in `PythonOperator` have been refactored into `airflow.utils.helper.make_kwargs_callable`. And it's used in those other places to make them work the same way.\r\n\r\n`PythonOperator` and `PythonSensor` already accept `python_callable` in this form, i.e. the callable can request any number of named arguments in `context`:\r\n```\r\ndef python_callable(execution_date, ds_nodash):\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, `ExternalTaskSensor` and some other sensors/operator accepts only callables in this form:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef execution_date_fn(execution_date):\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more recent change #8702 added support for this form as well:\r\n```\r\ndef execution_date_fn(execution_date, context):\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, #8702 introduced an unpleasant side-effect. Because it enforces the number of arguments is either 1 or 2, it stops people from using common techniques such as loop variable capturing. E.g. this comment illustrate a problem: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/8702/files#r497897460\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses these problems by making `execution_date_fn` work the same way as `python_callable`. `execution_date_fn` is now much more flexible. It can accept any variable number of keyword arguments from `context`. The change is backward compatible. Existing usage continues to work. \r\n\r\nE.g. the following callables are all legitimate execution_date_fn after this PR:\r\n```\r\n            def execution_date_fn(dt):\r\n                ...\r\n\r\n            def execution_date_fn(execution_date):\r\n                ...\r\n\r\n            def execution_date_fn(execution_date, context):\r\n                ...\r\n\r\n            def execution_date_fn(execution_date, ds_nodash):\r\n                ...\r\n\r\n            def execution_date_fn(execution_date, ds_nodash, dag):\r\n                ...\r\n```","created_at":"2020-10-28T15:34:59Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T23:41:27Z","closed_at":"2020-11-09T21:05:08Z","merged_at":"2020-11-09T21:05:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"badd890675d3cb3dfc088bff6a1d73dfdc275f31","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full

If the Airflow scheduler is restarted (e.g. due to\r\nrollout of a new Kubernetes version), then the timeout\r\nbehaviour of a sensor should not be affected.\r\nBut before the code change, the timer would start from\r\nzero again when the sensor is retried. This was unexpected.\r\n\r\nSolution: When a sensor is retried, then the sensor\r\nuses the start date of the earliest try to justify\r\na time-out. To stay backwards-compatible, the new behaviour\r\nis only active when explicitly activated for that sensor.\r\n\r\nNote: The exponential backoff feature for poking still uses\r\nthe start date of the current try. This is to keep the\r\ncode change small. No issues expected from that.\r\n\r\nrelated: #9232 (the linked issue cares about execution_timeout for tasks\r\nin general, not only sensors)","created_at":"2020-10-27T13:56:08Z","updated_at":"2021-03-31T00:47:28Z","closed_at":"2021-03-31T00:47:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2091d08a87cbf3bc5b9f98dc2a75580abb6d6f3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

when a dag file is under processing and multiple callbacks are\r\ncreated either via zombies or executor events, the dag file is added to\r\nthe _file_path_queue and the manager will launch a new process to\r\nprocess it, which it should not since the dag file is currently under\r\nprocessing. This will bypass the _parallelism eventually especially when\r\nit takes long time to process some dag files. We have seen ~200 dag\r\nprocessors on the scheduler even we set the _parallelism as 60. More dag\r\nfile processors make CPU spike and in turn it makes the dag file\r\nprocessing even slower. In the end, the scheduler is taken down.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#11795\r\n\r\nThis update improves the presentation of the DAGs (home) view by making better use of the horizontal space. This was accomplished through a handful of changes:\r\n\r\n- Fixed the broken tooltip on the \"i\" icon in the leftmost column heading by adding missing `js-tooltip` class.\r\n- Moves the tags beneath the DAG ID. By not having left and right aligned elements within the same column, the contents of the cell flow better with the variation of screen widths, and there is less visual distraction with a single alignment point.\r\n- Changes the tag background from green to blue. Green typically communicates a positive status, but in this context the tag has no relation to the DAG's status. The blue is a better neutral color. \r\n- Changed the column order to a more logical organization. Going left-to-right the order now displays broader-to-detailed properties of the DAG. It also seemed to make more sense to have \"schedule\" and \"last run\" adjacent to each other given the former determines the latter.\r\n- Moved the existing CSS only used for this view out of the shared (`main.css`) file to a dedicated `dags.css` file only loaded for this view. The new CSS added in this PR was added to this file as well.\r\n- With the \"links\" taking up a great deal of space and not providing any actual detail of the DAGs, I've moved them to a hidden menu in the last column of the table. The menu is revealed upon hover of the \"•••\". In addition to saving space, this alleviates a lot of the visual clutter of having so many icons grouped  throughout the page. Additionally, this allows text to be displayed beside the link icons—providing much better information to the user. I've reversed the prior order of the links in order to reduce the mouse travel to the most popular (tree, graph).\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 2020-10-28 at 11 24 31 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/97457890-8cf57600-1910-11eb-86f9-679e7882453c.gif)\r\n\r\n- Doc screenshot of this view has been updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots of overall updates\r\n\r\n**Full width - Before**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1576\" alt=\"Image 2020-10-26 at 5 22 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/97232928-73d7b280-17b4-11eb-9152-34c06819cfec.png\">\r\n\r\n**Full width - After**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1576\" alt=\"Image 2020-10-26 at 5 23 16 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/97232921-71755880-17b4-11eb-9685-8d00724a0d1d.png\">\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n**Narrow width - Before**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1335\" alt=\"Image 2020-10-26 at 5 21 33 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/97232904-66222d00-17b4-11eb-8fdd-b00503151629.png\">\r\n\r\n**Narrow width - After**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1333\" alt=\"Image 2020-10-26 at 5 11 22 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3267/97233004-9e297000-17b4-11eb-9377-d2192aadc3c5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in [UPDATING.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md).\r\n","created_at":"2020-10-26T22:01:44Z","updated_at":"2020-11-18T16:14:29Z","closed_at":"2020-10-29T21:48:59Z","merged_at":"2020-10-29T21:48:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4b90da0feef6352555c2bb4cc8f913048090869","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.
