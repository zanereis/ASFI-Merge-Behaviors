What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDo not increase the input metrics when reading rdd from the cache\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nInput Metrics will be increased

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWhen CSV/JSON datasources infer schema (e.g, `def inferSchema(files: Seq[FileStatus])`, they use the `files` along with the original options. `files` in `inferSchema` could have been deduced from the \"path\" option if the option was present, so this can cause issues (e.g., reading more data, listing the path again) since the \"path\" option is **added** to the `files`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe current behavior can cause the following issue:\r\n```scala\r\nclass TestFileFilter extends PathFilter {\r\n  override def accept(path: Path): Boolean = path.getParent.getName != \"p=2\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nval path = \"/tmp\"\r\nval df = spark.range(2)\r\ndf.write.json(path + \"/p=1\")\r\ndf.write.json(path + \"/p=2\")\r\n\r\nval extraOptions = Map(\r\n  \"mapred.input.pathFilter.class\" -> classOf[TestFileFilter].getName,\r\n  \"mapreduce.input.pathFilter.class\" -> classOf[TestFileFilter].getName\r\n)\r\n\r\n// This works fine.\r\nassert(spark.read.options(extraOptions).json(path).count == 2)\r\n\r\n// The following with \"path\" option fails with the following:\r\n// assertion failed: Conflicting directory structures detected. Suspicious paths\r\n//\tfile:/tmp\r\n//\tfile:/tmp/p=1\r\nassert(spark.read.options(extraOptions).format(\"json\").option(\"path\", path).load.count() === 2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the above failure doesn't happen and you get the consistent experience when you use `spark.read.csv(path)` or `spark.read.format(\"csv\").option(\"path\", path).load`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests.","created_at":"2020-08-15T01:52:36Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T16:41:41Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T16:23:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ef0b93392846d00b71ea2e79d9eced91a89925f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29437/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29437/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29437/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6f147ee0ac20af8142a3dc715a9dbc7952f99265","head":{"label":"imback82:path_bug","ref":"path_bug","sha":"6f147ee0ac20af8142a3dc715a9dbc7952f99265","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe purpose of this pr is to resolve [SPARK-32526](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32526), all remaining failed cases are fixed.\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Change of `ExecutorAllocationManager.scala` for core module compilation in Scala 2.13, it's a blocking problem\r\n\r\n- Change `Seq[_]` to `scala.collection.Seq[_]` refer to failed cases\r\n\r\n- Added different expected plan of `Test 4: Star with several branches` of StarJoinCostBasedReorderSuite  for Scala 2.13 because the candidates plans:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJoin Inner, (d1_pk#5 = f1_fk1#0)\r\n:- Join Inner, (f1_fk2#1 = d2_pk#8)\r\n:  :- Join Inner, (f1_fk3#2 = d3_pk#11)\r\n```\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\nJoin Inner, (f1_fk2#1 = d2_pk#8)\r\n:- Join Inner, (d1_pk#5 = f1_fk1#0)\r\n:  :- Join Inner, (f1_fk3#2 = d3_pk#11)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhave same cost `Cost(200,9200)`, but `HashMap` is rewritten in scala 2.13 and The order of iterations leads to different results.\r\n\r\nThis pr fix test cases as follow:\r\n\r\n- LiteralExpressionSuite (1 FAILED -> PASS)\r\n- StarJoinCostBasedReorderSuite ( 1 FAILED-> PASS)\r\n- ObjectExpressionsSuite( 2 FAILED-> PASS)\r\n- ScalaReflectionSuite （1 FAILED-> PASS）\r\n- RowEncoderSuite (10 FAILED-> PASS)\r\n- ExpressionEncoderSuite  (ABORTED-> PASS)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.13: Do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests  -pl sql/catalyst -Pscala-2.13 -am\r\nmvn test -pl

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe purpose of this pr is to resolve [SPARK-32526](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32526), all remaining failed cases are fixed.\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr as follow:\r\n\r\n- Fix core module compilation in Scala 2.13, it's a blocking problem\r\n\r\n- Change `Seq[_]` to `scala.collection.Seq[_]` refer to failed cases\r\n\r\n- Use `scala.collection.immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` instead of WrappedArray.make in Scala 2.13 in `RowEncoderdeserializerFor` ArrayType branch, this change fix most failed case of `RowEncoder`\r\n\r\n- Added different expected plan of `Test 4: Star with several branches` in Scala 2.13 because the candidates plans:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJoin Inner, (d1_pk#5 = f1_fk1#0)\r\n:- Join Inner, (f1_fk2#1 = d2_pk#8)\r\n:  :- Join Inner, (f1_fk3#2 = d3_pk#11)\r\n```\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\nJoin Inner, (f1_fk2#1 = d2_pk#8)\r\n:- Join Inner, (d1_pk#5 = f1_fk1#0)\r\n:  :- Join Inner, (f1_fk3#2 = d3_pk#11)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhave same cost `Cost(200,9200)`, but `HashMap` is rewritten in scala 2.13 and The order of iterations leads to different results.\r\n\r\nThis pr fix test cases as follow:\r\n\r\n- LiteralExpressionSuite (1 FAILED -> PASS)\r\n- StarJoinCostBasedReorderSuite ( 1 FAILED-> PASS)\r\n- ObjectExpressionsSuite( 2 FAILED-> PASS)\r\n- ScalaReflectionSuite （1 FAILED-> PASS）\r\n- RowEncoderSuite (10 FAILED-> PASS)\r\n- ExpressionEncoderSuite  (ABORTED-> PASS)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.13: Do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests  -pl sql/catalyst -Pscala-2.13 -am\r\nmvn test -pl sql/catalyst

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nUse the `LinkedHashMap` instead of `immutable.Map` to hold the `Window` expressions in `ExtractWindowExpressions.addWindow`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a bug fix for https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29270. In that PR, the generated plan(especially for the queries q47, q49, q57) on Jenkins always can not match the golden plan generated on my laptop. \r\n\r\nIt happens because `ExtractWindowExpressions.addWindow` now uses `immutable.Map` to hold the `Window` expressions by the key `(spec.partitionSpec, spec.orderSpec, WindowFunctionType.functionType(expr))` and converts the map to `Seq` at the end. Then, the `Seq` is used to add Window operators on top of the child plan. However, for the same query, the order of Windows expression inside the `Seq` could be undetermined when the expression id changes(which can affect the key). As a result, the same query could have different plans because of the undetermined order of Window operators.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we use `LinkedHashMap`, which records the insertion order of entries, to make the adding order determined. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMaybe yes, users now always see the same plan for the same queries with multiple Window operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's really hard to make a reproduce demo. I just tested manually with https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29270 and it looks

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFound java.util.NoSuchElementException in UT log of AdaptiveQueryExecSuite. During AQE, when sub-plan changed, LiveExecutionData is using the new sub-plan SQLMetrics to override the old ones, But in the final aggregateMetrics, since the plan was updated, the old metrics will throw NoSuchElementException when it try to match with the new metricTypes. To sum up, we need to filter out those outdated metrics to avoid throwing java.util.NoSuchElementException,  which cause SparkUI SQL Tab abnormally rendered.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSQL Metrics is not correct for some AQE cases, and it break SparkUI SQL Tab when it comes to NAAJ rewritten to LocalRelation case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n* Added case in SQLAppStatusListenerSuite.\r\n* Run AdaptiveQueryExecSuite with no \"java.util.NoSuchElementException\".\r\n* Validation on

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a follow-up of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29149. The change is that when writing a large value list, we divide the value list to a set of 128-values smaller batches, and bulk write these smaller batches one by one. This improvement can reduce memory pressure caused by serialization and give fairness to other writing threads. The idea is proposed by @mridulm in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29149#issuecomment-671551444.\r\n\r\nUpdate 9/1: After adding the unit test, I found the count of objects cannot be updated properly when using writeAll. This PR also fix the issue by using a hash map to temporarily store and update the delta of each countKey, and put the countKey with its delta to WriteBatch before calling db.write(batch).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Fix the count update bug when calling writeAll().\r\n2. Reduce the memory pressure and alleviate the fairness issue when batch writing a very long value list.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test and manual test.\r\n\r\nA test case testWriteAll() is added in LevelDBSuite.java.\r\n\r\nI compared some write-related benchmark tests in LevelDBBenchmark.java between writeAll() and write(). The test was conducted in an HDD disk, and the disk is not busy.\r\n\r\n| benchmark test (writing 10000 objects)           | with writeAll(), ms | with write(), ms |\r\n| ------------------------ |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe DecommissionWorkerSuite started becoming flaky and it revealed a real regression. Recently closed #29211 necessitates remembering the decommissioning shortly beyond the removal of the executor.\r\n\r\nIn addition to fixing this issue, ensure that DecommissionWorkerSuite continues to pass when executors haven't had a chance to exit eagery. That is the old behavior before #29211 also still works.\r\n\r\nAdded some more tests to TaskSchedulerImpl to ensure that the decommissioning information is indeed purged after a timeout.\r\n\r\nHardened the test DecommissionWorkerSuite to make it wait for successful job completion.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFirst, let me describe the intended behavior of decommissioning: If a fetch failure happens where the source executor was decommissioned, we want to treat that as an eager signal to clear all shuffle state associated with that executor. In addition if we know that the host was decommissioned, we want to forget about all map statuses from all other executors on that decommissioned host. This is what the test \"decommission workers ensure that fetch failures lead to rerun\" is trying to test. This invariant is important to ensure that decommissioning a host does not lead to multiple fetch failures that might fail the job. This fetch failure can happen before the executor is truly marked \"lost\" because of heartbeat delays.\r\n\r\n- However, #29211 eagerly exits the executors when they are done decommissioning. This removal of the executor was racing with the fetch failure. By the time the fetch failure is triggered the executor is already removed and thus has forgotten its decommissioning information. (I tested this by delaying the decommissioning). The fix is to keep the decommissioning information around for some time after removal with some extra logic to finally purge it after a timeout.\r\n\r\n- In addition the executor loss can also bump up `shuffleFileLostEpoch` (added in #28848). This happens because when the executor is lost, it forgets the shuffle state about just that executor and increments the `shuffleFileLostEpoch`. This incrementing precludes the clearing of state of the entire host when the fetch failure happens because the failed task is still reusing the old epoch. The fix here is also simple: Ignore the `shuffleFileLostEpoch` when the shuffle status is being cleared due to a fetch failure resulting from host decommission.\r\n\r\nI am strategically making both of these fixes be very local to decommissioning to avoid other regressions. Especially the version stuff is tricky (it hasn't been fundamentally changed since it was first introduced in 2013).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManually ran DecommissionWorkerSuite several times using a script and ensured it all passed.\r\n\r\n### (Internal) Configs added\r\nI added two configs, one of which is sort of meant for testing only:\r\n- `spark.test.executor.decommission.initial.sleep.millis`: Initial delay by the decommissioner shutdown thread. Default is same as before of 1 second. This is used for testing only. This one is kept \"hidden\" (ie not added as a constant to avoid config bloat)\r\n- `spark.executor.decommission.removed.infoCacheTTL`: Number of seconds to keep the removed executors decom entries around. It defaults to 5 minutes. It should be around the average time it takes for all of the shuffle data to be fetched from the mapper to the reducer, but I think that can take a while since the reducers also do a multistep

introduced DaysWritable which extends DateWrite from hive to handle date type. DaysWritable.toString() is called to write its value into hive table. DateWrite.toString() is defined as:\r\n@Override\r\npublic String toString() {\r\n // For toString, the time does not matter\r\n return get(false).toString();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic Date get(boolean doesTimeMatter) {\r\n  return new Date(daysToMillis(daysSinceEpoch, doesTimeMatter));\r\n}\r\n\r\nDaysWritable didn't override toString(), neither get(boolean doesTimeMatter)。It did override get():\r\noverride def get(): Date = new Date(DateWritable.daysToMillis(julianDays))\r\nbut this didn't help with toString(), so with daysSinceEpoch in DateWritable always as 0, calls to DaysWritable.toString() will always return '1970-01-01', and as a result date value stored into hive table will always have value '1970-01-01'。\r\n\r\nThis pull request overrides DaysWritable.get(boolean doesTimeMatter) so that it's toString() behaves properly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix the correctness issue describe above.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n(back-porting from https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/9a3811dbf5f1234c1587337a3d74823d1d163b53)\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue introduced during SPARK-26985.\r\n\r\nSPARK-26985 changes the `putDoubles()` and `putFloats()` methods to respect the platform's endian-ness.  However, that causes the RLE paths in VectorizedRleValuesReader.java to read the RLE entries in parquet as BIG_ENDIAN on big endian platforms (i.e., as is), even though parquet data is always in little endian format.\r\n\r\nThe comments in `WriteableColumnVector.java` say those methods are used for \"ieee formatted doubles in platform native endian\" (or floats), but since the data in parquet is always in little endian format, use of those methods appears to be inappropriate.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the problem with spark-shell:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\n    \r\nvar data = Seq(\r\n  (1.0, 0.1),\r\n  (2.0, 0.2),\r\n  (0.3, 3.0),\r\n  (4.0, 4.0),\r\n  (5.0, 5.0))\r\n  \r\nvar df = spark.createDataFrame(data).write.mode(SaveMode.Overwrite).parquet(\"/tmp/data.parquet2\")\r\nvar df2 = spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/data.parquet2\")\r\ndf2.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nresult:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n+--------------------+--------------------+                                     \r\n|                  _1|                  _2|\r\n+--------------------+--------------------+\r\n|           3.16E-322|-1.54234871366845...|\r\n|         2.0553E-320|         2.0553E-320|\r\n|          2.561E-320|          2.561E-320|\r\n|4.66726145843124E-62|         1.0435E-320|\r\n|        3.03865E-319|-1.54234871366757...|\r\n+--------------------+--------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso tests in ParquetIOSuite that involve float/double data would fail, e.g., \r\n\r\n- basic data types (without binary)\r\n- read raw Parquet file\r\n\r\n/examples/src/main/python/mllib/isotonic_regression_example.py would fail as well.\r\n\r\nPurposed code change is to add `putDoublesLittleEndian()` and `putFloatsLittleEndian()` methods for parquet to invoke, just like the existing `putIntsLittleEndian()` and `putLongsLittleEndian()`.  On little endian platforms they would call `putDoubles()` and `putFloats()`, on big endian they would read the entries as little endian like pre-SPARK-26985.\r\n\r\nNo new unit-test is introduced as

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces some arbitrary task names in logs with the widely used task name (e.g. \"task 0.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 1)\") among driver and executor. This will change the task name in `TaskDescription` by appending TID.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nSome logs are still using TID(a.k.a `taskId`) only as the task name, e.g., \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7f275ee5978e00ac514e25f5ef1d4e3331f8031b/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/Executor.scala#L786\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7f275ee5978e00ac514e25f5ef1d4e3331f8031b/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/Executor.scala#L632-L635\r\n\r\nAnd the task thread name also only has the `taskId`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7f275ee5978e00ac514e25f5ef1d4e3331f8031b/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/Executor.scala#L325\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1259, TID itself does not capture stage or retries, making it harder to correlate with the application. It's inconvenient when debugging applications.\r\n\r\nActually, task name like \"task name (e.g. \"task 0.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 1)\")\" has already been used widely after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/1259. We'd better follow the naming convention. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Users will see the more consistent task names in the log.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nManually checked.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-12T10:01:07Z","updated_at":"2020-08-19T08:51:07Z","closed_at":"2020-08-19T08:45:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"860e9abb2fb07992b49696146824461c8f1c6da2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ade4c9e256c5cb3c5ec6e48d288bfa5ff669521d","head":{"label":"Ngone51:unify-task-name","ref":"unify-task-name","sha":"ade4c9e256c5cb3c5ec6e48d288bfa5ff669521d","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Test TEXTFILE together with the PARQUET and ORC file formats in `HiveSerDeReadWriteSuite`\r\n- Remove the \"SPARK-32594: insert dates to a Hive table\" added by #29409\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To improve test coverage, and test other row SerDe - `org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.LazySimpleSerDe`.\r\n- The removed test is not needed anymore because the bug reported in SPARK-32594 is triggered by the TEXTFILE file format too.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite

Producer thread keeps on adding the events to the Queue and Consumer thread is consuming the events at the slower rate compare to the Producer adding in the queue. Resulting the Queue to reach max size and events get dropped from that.\r\n\r\nThere are times if Queue Size would be little bit higher like 10 percent (or 20 percent) extra of the existing Queue size, the events can be processed preventing the event drop at that point of time.\r\n\r\nAs per the current architecture size of event Queue can be configured at start of the application by setting spark.scheduler.listenerbus.eventqueue.capacity. Once this is set there is fixed size event Queue(LinkedBlockingQueue), which cannot be changed at run time to accommodate some extra events before dropping event from the Queue\r\n\r\nThis Jira for adding a support of VariableLinkedBlockingQueue to tune the dropping of the events.\r\n\r\nVariableLinkedBlockingQueue -> https://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-java-client/v3.5.4/rabbitmq-java-client-javadoc-3.5.4/com/rabbitmq/client/impl/VariableLinkedBlockingQueue.html\r\n\r\nAs the part of this PR, we can provide the support for VariableLinkedBlockingQueue. \r\n1) We need to add those Queue where we are seeing the event drop and add to spark.set.optmized.event.queue.\r\nset --conf spark.set.optmized.event.queue=appStatus,executorManagement -> Now these two queues will be\r\nVariableLinkedBlockingQueue and size of the queue can be increased at run time.\r\nBy default its empty string so all the Queues will use the old behavior LinkedBlockingQueue\r\n2) We can set threshold of the size of the queue that we want to increase -> spark.set.optmized.event.queue.threshold\r\n3) We can increase the capacity of the queue, if the driverMemoryUsed is less than 90 percent of max heap size.\r\n\r\nNow if we use VariableLinkedBlockingQueue, at the time when the size of the queue reach the size initialized at start of the job , Queue will try to increase the size of the Queue to threshold (spark.set.optmized.event.queue.threshold) and prevent the Event drop at that point of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nNow if we use VariableLinkedBlockingQueue, at the time when the size of the queue reach the size initialised at start of the job , Queue will try to increase the size of the Queue to threshold (spark.set.optmized.event.queue.threshold) and prevent the Event drop at that point of time.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of SPARK-25557. In this PR, the case-sensitivity stuff was removed from OrcFiltersBase.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe will set the current config value of `spark.sql.caseSensitive` to [`OrcConf.IS_SCHEMA_EVOLUTION_CASE_SENSITIVE`](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ORC-264) before reading ORC, e.g. at `OrcFileFormat` and `OrcPartitionReaderFactory`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6be8b935a4f7ce0dea2d7aaaf747c2e8e1a9f47a/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/orc/OrcFileFormat.scala#L167\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6be8b935a4f7ce0dea2d7aaaf747c2e8e1a9f47a/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/v2/orc/OrcPartitionReaderFactory.scala#L69\r\n\r\nThis is why we did't have case-sensitivity map previously. We don't need to add the CaseInsensitiveMap.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass Jenkins

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nClear Ivy resolution files as part of finally block if not failures while artifacts resolution can leave the resolution files around.\r\nUse tempIvyPath for SparkSubmitUtils.buildIvySettings in tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix `DaysWritable` by overriding parent's method `def get(doesTimeMatter: Boolean): Date` from `DateWritable` instead of `Date get()` because the former one uses the first one. The bug occurs because `HiveOutputWriter.write()` call `def get(doesTimeMatter: Boolean): Date` transitively with default implementation from the parent class  `DateWritable` which doesn't respect date rebases and uses not initialized `daysSinceEpoch` (0 which is `1970-01-01`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the bug:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE table1 (d date);\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO table1 VALUES (date '2020-08-11');\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM table1;\r\n1970-01-01\r\n```\r\nThe expected result of the last SQL statement must be **2020-08-11** but got **1970-01-01**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the fix, `INSERT` work correctly:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM table1;\r\n2020-08-11\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test to

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSet more dispatcher threads for the flaky test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen running test on Github Actions machine, the available processors in JVM  is only 2, while on Jenkins it's 32. For this specific test, 2 available processors, which also decides the number of threads in Dispatcher, are not enough to consume the messages. In the worst situation, `MockExecutorLaunchFailWorker` would occupy these 2 threads for handling messages `LaunchDriver`, `LaunchExecutor` at the same time but leave no thread for the driver to handle the message `RegisteredApplication`. At the end, it results in a deadlock situation and causes the test failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe can check whether the test is still flaky in Github Actions after this fix.","created_at":"2020-08-11T13:15:25Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T12:42:49Z","closed_at":"2020-08-12T12:05:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8f8683f8474e0b38130d32209758baef77827dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29408/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29408/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29408/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0e76b5607663531ed4a6d0a5dca3f7f2a8fe393f","head":{"label":"Ngone51:spark-32250","ref":"spark-32250","sha":"0e76b5607663531ed4a6d0a5dca3f7f2a8fe393f","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe support partially push partition filters since SPARK-28169. We can also support partially push down data filters if it mixed in partition filters and data filters. For example:\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\r\n  s\"\"\"\r\n     |CREATE TABLE t(i INT, p STRING)\r\n     |USING parquet\r\n     |PARTITIONED BY (p)\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\nspark.range(0, 1000).selectExpr(\"id as col\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"temp\")\r\nfor (part <- Seq(1, 2, 3, 4)) {\r\n  sql(s\"\"\"\r\n         |INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE t PARTITION (p='$part')\r\n         |SELECT col FROM temp\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n}\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM t WHERE  WHERE (p = '1' AND i = 1) OR (p = '2' and i = 2)\").explain()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also push down ```i = 1 or i = 2 ```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExtract more data filter to FileSourceScanExec\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29125\r\nIn branch 3.0: \r\n1. for hash aggregation, before https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29125 there will be a runtime exception on decimal overflow of sum aggregation; after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29125, there could be a wrong result.\r\n2. for sort aggregation, with/without https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29125, there could be a wrong result on decimal overflow.\r\n\r\nWhile in master branch(the future 3.1 release), the problem doesn't exist since in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/27627 there is a flag for marking whether overflow happens in aggregation buffer. However, the aggregation buffer is written in steaming checkpoints. Thus, we can't change to aggregation buffer to resolve the issue. \r\n\r\nAs there is no easy solution for returning null/throwing exception regarding `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` on overflow in branch 3.0, we have to make a choice here: always throw exception on decimal value overflow of sum aggregation.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAvoid returning wrong result in decimal value sum aggregation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, there is always exception on decimal value overflow of sum aggregation, instead of a possible wrong result.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to `include` `_images` and `_sources` directories, generated from Sphinx, in Jekyll build.\r\n\r\n**For `_images` directory,**\r\nAfter SPARK-31851, now we add some images to use within the pages built by Sphinx. It copies and images into `_images` directory. Later, when Jekyll builds, the underscore directories are ignored by default which ends up with missing image in the main doc.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-11 at 1 52 46 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/89859104-2e571080-dbdb-11ea-817c-c04bbcd4088e.png)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-11 at 1 49 00 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6477701/89859105-30b96a80-dbdb-11ea-85c6-8a135eddf613.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**For `_sources` directory,**\r\nPlease refer [here](https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/sphinx-pretty-searchresults#source-links) and [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#confval-html_copy_source). They are generated by default and used by default in the documentations by Sphinx, and we should better include them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo show the images correctly in PySpark documentation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, only in unreleased branches.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nSKIP_SCALADOC=1 SKIP_RDOC=1 SKIP_SQLDOC=1 jekyll serve --watch\r\n```\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-11T05:03:07Z","updated_at":"2020-12-07T02:06:31Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T06:15:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6144fbaabbf36f9055d4aacdfdb048ae09266fd8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3cb789155ac0fe60d91f11784f97876ac9928852","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-32584","ref":"SPARK-32584","sha":"3cb789155ac0fe60d91f11784f97876ac9928852","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Make `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.maxNumConcurrentTasks()` considers all kinds of resources when calculating the max concurrent tasks\r\n\r\n2. Refactor `calculateAvailableSlots()` to make it be able to be used for both `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend` and `TaskSchedulerImpl`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, `CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.maxNumConcurrentTasks()` only considers the CPU for the max concurrent tasks. This can cause the application to hang when a barrier stage requires extra custom resources but the cluster doesn't have enough corresponding resources. Because, without the checking for other custom resources in `maxNumConcurrentTasks`, the barrier stage can be submitted to the `TaskSchedulerImpl`. But the `TaskSchedulerImpl` won't launch tasks for the barrier stage due to the insufficient task slots calculated by `TaskSchedulerImpl.calculateAvailableSlots` (which does check all kinds of resources).\r\n\r\nIf the barrier stage doesn't launch all the tasks in one true, the application will fail and suggest user to disable delay scheduling. However, this actually a misleading suggestion since the real root cause is not enough resources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. In case of a barrier stage requires more custom resources than the cluster has, previously, the application will fail with misleading suggestion of disabling delay scheduling. After this PR, the application will fail with the error message saying not enough resources. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test.","created_at":"2020-08-10T06:42:29Z","updated_at":"2020-08-18T06:50:43Z","closed_at":"2020-08-18T06:50:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cad7d9e4bf5bb05211a8d37ef612f966277343ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/daa205dc9f257f42b794767601fd844dd596e374","head":{"label":"Ngone51:backport-spark-32518","ref":"backport-spark-32518","sha":"daa205dc9f257f42b794767601fd844dd596e374","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSynchronize listing iteration manually\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt seems to be a race condition in `FSHistoryProvider` that iterate the listing with high concurrency:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nval stale = listing.view(classOf[LogInfo])\r\n .index(\"lastProcessed\")\r\n .last(newLastScanTime - 1)\r\n .asScala\r\n .toList\r\n```\r\n\r\n`toList` will iterate items in the listing, if one of listing entries was deleted by some clean thread, `checkForLogs` will throw out a `java.util.NoSuchElementException` and abort current execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThe race contention is hard to reproduce, but the current logic seems causing the issue.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-08T12:39:19Z","updated_at":"2021-02-01T00:55:47Z","closed_at":"2021-02-01T00:55:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e761b73dc424a7f5961d278558ccb663f2a91d7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e20671f1621f7eac31a1fbf954b950ad2e7ab9be","head":{"label":"yanxiaole:SPARK-32574","ref":"SPARK-32574","sha":"e20671f1621f7eac31a1fbf954b950ad2e7ab9be","user":{"login":"yanxiaole","id":5363203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjMyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5363203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole","html_url":"https://github.com/yanxiaole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285017138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODUwMTcxMzg=","name":"spark","full_name":"yanxiaole/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanxiaole","id":5363203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNjMyMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5363203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole","html_url":"https://github.com/yanxiaole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanxiaole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanxiaole/spark","description":"Apache

But, the generated plans can be different from actual ones because the input tables are empty (e.g., the plans always use broadcast-hash joins, but actual ones use sort-merge joins for larger tables). To mitigate the issue, this PR defines data statistics constants extracted from generated TPCDS data in `TPCDSTableStats`, then injects the statistics via `spark.sessionState.catalog.alterTableStats` when defining TPCDS tables in `TPCDSQuerySuite`.\r\n\r\nPlease see a link below about how to extract the table statistics:\r\n - https://gist.github.com/maropu/f553d32c323ee803d39e2f7fa0b5a8c3\r\n\r\nFor example, the generated plans of TPCDS `q2` are different with/without this fix:\r\n```\r\n==== w/ this fix: q2 ====\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n* Sort (43)\r\n+- Exchange (42)\r\n   +- * Project (41)\r\n      +- * SortMergeJoin Inner (40)\r\n         :- * Sort (28)\r\n         :  +- Exchange (27)\r\n         :     +- * Project (26)\r\n         :        +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (25)\r\n         :           :- * HashAggregate (19)\r\n         :           :  +- Exchange (18)\r\n         :           :     +- * HashAggregate (17)\r\n         :           :        +- * Project (16)\r\n         :           :           +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (15)\r\n         :           :              :- Union (9)\r\n         :           :              :  :- * Project (4)\r\n         :           :              :  :  +- * Filter (3)\r\n         :           :              :  :     +- * ColumnarToRow (2)\r\n         :           :              :  :        +- Scan parquet default.web_sales (1)\r\n         :           :              :  +- * Project (8)\r\n         :           :              :     +- * Filter (7)\r\n         :           :              :        +- * ColumnarToRow (6)\r\n         :           :              :           +- Scan parquet default.catalog_sales (5)\r\n         :           :              +- BroadcastExchange (14)\r\n         :           :                 +- * Project (13)\r\n         :           :                    +- * Filter (12)\r\n         :           :                       +- * ColumnarToRow (11)\r\n         :           :                          +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (10)\r\n         :           +- BroadcastExchange (24)\r\n         :              +- * Project (23)\r\n         :                 +- * Filter (22)\r\n         :                    +- * ColumnarToRow (21)\r\n         :                       +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (20)\r\n         +- * Sort (39)\r\n            +- Exchange (38)\r\n               +- * Project (37)\r\n                  +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (36)\r\n                     :- * HashAggregate (30)\r\n                     :  +- ReusedExchange (29)\r\n                     +- BroadcastExchange (35)\r\n                        +- * Project (34)\r\n                           +- * Filter (33)\r\n                              +- * ColumnarToRow (32)\r\n                                 +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (31)\r\n\r\n==== w/o this fix: q2 ====\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n* Sort (40)\r\n+- Exchange (39)\r\n   +- * Project (38)\r\n      +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (37)\r\n         :- * Project (26)\r\n         :  +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (25)\r\n         :     :- * HashAggregate (19)\r\n         :     :  +- Exchange (18)\r\n         :     :     +- * HashAggregate (17)\r\n         :     :        +- * Project (16)\r\n         :     :           +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (15)\r\n         :     :              :- Union (9)\r\n         :     :              :  :- * Project (4)\r\n         :     :              :  :  +- * Filter (3)\r\n         :     :              :  :     +- * ColumnarToRow (2)\r\n         :     :              :  :        +- Scan parquet default.web_sales (1)\r\n         :     :              :  +- * Project (8)\r\n         :     :              :     +- * Filter (7)\r\n         :     :              :        +- * ColumnarToRow (6)\r\n         :     :              :           +- Scan parquet default.catalog_sales (5)\r\n         :     :              +- BroadcastExchange (14)\r\n         :     :                 +- * Project (13)\r\n         :     :                    +- * Filter (12)\r\n         :     :                       +- * ColumnarToRow (11)\r\n         :     :                          +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (10)\r\n         :     +- BroadcastExchange (24)\r\n         :        +- * Project (23)\r\n         :           +- * Filter (22)\r\n         :              +- * ColumnarToRow (21)\r\n         :                 +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (20)\r\n         +- BroadcastExchange (36)\r\n            +- * Project (35)\r\n               +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (34)\r\n                  :- * HashAggregate (28)\r\n                  :  +- ReusedExchange (27)\r\n                  +- BroadcastExchange (33)\r\n                     +- * Project (32)\r\n                        +- * Filter (31)\r\n                           +- * ColumnarToRow (30)\r\n                              +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (29)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis comes from the @cloud-fan comment: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29270#issuecomment-666098964\r\n\r\nThis is the backport of #29384.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn [SPARK-32290](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32290), we introduced several new types of HashedRelation.\r\n\r\n* EmptyHashedRelation\r\n* EmptyHashedRelationWithAllNullKeys\r\n\r\nThey were all limited to used only in NAAJ scenario. These new HashedRelation could be applied to other scenario for performance improvements.\r\n\r\n* EmptyHashedRelation could also be used in Normal AntiJoin for fast stop\r\n* While AQE is on and buildSide is EmptyHashedRelationWithAllNullKeys, can convert NAAJ to a Empty LocalRelation to skip meaningless data iteration since in Single-Key NAAJ, if null key exists in BuildSide, will drop all records in streamedSide.\r\n\r\nThis Patch including two changes.\r\n\r\n* using EmptyHashedRelation to do fast stop for common anti join as well\r\n* In AQE, eliminate BroadcastHashJoin(NAAJ) if buildSide is a EmptyHashedRelationWithAllNullKeys\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLeftAntiJoin could apply `fast stop` when BuildSide is EmptyHashedRelation, While within AQE with EmptyHashedRelationWithAllNullKeys, we can eliminate the NAAJ. This should be a performance improvement in AntiJoin.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n* added case in AdaptiveQueryExecSuite.\r\n* added case in HashedRelationSuite.\r\n* Make sure SubquerySuite JoinSuite SQLQueryTestSuite passed.","created_at":"2020-08-08T09:46:24Z","updated_at":"2020-08-11T06:24:03Z","closed_at":"2020-08-11T06:24:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07f20d8a308b4f5ee24243aefe2ef2544dff5fb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5309b66b23af2ffe7999edbd8f0c11f26628805d","head":{"label":"leanken-zz:leanken-SPARK-32573","ref":"leanken-SPARK-32573","sha":"5309b66b23af2ffe7999edbd8f0c11f26628805d","user":{"login":"leanken-zz","id":17242071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjQyMDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17242071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/leanken-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":191892121,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE4OTIxMjE=","name":"spark","full_name":"leanken-zz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"leanken-zz","id":17242071,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MjQyMDcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17242071?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz","html_url":"https://github.com/leanken-zz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leanken-zz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/leanken-zz/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs reported by @HyukjinKwon, BlockManagerDecommissionIntegrationSuite test is apparently still flaky (even after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29226): https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29226#issuecomment-670286829. \r\n\r\nThe new flakyness is because the executors are not launching in the 6 seconds time out I had given them when run under github checks.\r\n\r\nBumped up the timeouts.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make this test not flaky so that it can give us high signal if decommissioning regresses.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, unit test only check.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNo new tests. Just github and jenkins.","created_at":"2020-08-08T07:26:06Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T04:54:37Z","closed_at":"2020-08-10T03:00:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c55a0cf5d48c81f835ce38b47dddffcc229d5bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f69da1085e2e9766f2a60984b81209aff482ddcf","head":{"label":"agrawaldevesh:more_bm_harden","ref":"more_bm_harden","sha":"f69da1085e2e9766f2a60984b81209aff482ddcf","user":{"login":"agrawaldevesh","id":20564223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY0MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20564223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh","html_url":"https://github.com/agrawaldevesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":277609140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzc2MDkxNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"agrawaldevesh/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"agrawaldevesh","id":20564223,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNTY0MjIz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20564223?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh","html_url":"https://github.com/agrawaldevesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agrawaldevesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/agrawaldevesh/spark","description":"Apache

But, the generated plans can be different from actual ones because the input tables are empty (e.g., the plans always use broadcast-hash joins, but actual ones use sort-merge joins for larger tables). To mitigate the issue, this PR defines data statistics constants extracted from generated TPCDS data in `TPCDSTableStats`, then injects the statistics via `spark.sessionState.catalog.alterTableStats` when defining TPCDS tables in `TPCDSQuerySuite`.\r\n\r\nPlease see a link below about how to extract the table statistics:\r\n - https://gist.github.com/maropu/f553d32c323ee803d39e2f7fa0b5a8c3\r\n\r\nFor example, the generated plans of TPCDS `q2` are different with/without this fix:\r\n```\r\n==== w/ this fix: q2 ====\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n* Sort (43)\r\n+- Exchange (42)\r\n   +- * Project (41)\r\n      +- * SortMergeJoin Inner (40)\r\n         :- * Sort (28)\r\n         :  +- Exchange (27)\r\n         :     +- * Project (26)\r\n         :        +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (25)\r\n         :           :- * HashAggregate (19)\r\n         :           :  +- Exchange (18)\r\n         :           :     +- * HashAggregate (17)\r\n         :           :        +- * Project (16)\r\n         :           :           +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (15)\r\n         :           :              :- Union (9)\r\n         :           :              :  :- * Project (4)\r\n         :           :              :  :  +- * Filter (3)\r\n         :           :              :  :     +- * ColumnarToRow (2)\r\n         :           :              :  :        +- Scan parquet default.web_sales (1)\r\n         :           :              :  +- * Project (8)\r\n         :           :              :     +- * Filter (7)\r\n         :           :              :        +- * ColumnarToRow (6)\r\n         :           :              :           +- Scan parquet default.catalog_sales (5)\r\n         :           :              +- BroadcastExchange (14)\r\n         :           :                 +- * Project (13)\r\n         :           :                    +- * Filter (12)\r\n         :           :                       +- * ColumnarToRow (11)\r\n         :           :                          +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (10)\r\n         :           +- BroadcastExchange (24)\r\n         :              +- * Project (23)\r\n         :                 +- * Filter (22)\r\n         :                    +- * ColumnarToRow (21)\r\n         :                       +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (20)\r\n         +- * Sort (39)\r\n            +- Exchange (38)\r\n               +- * Project (37)\r\n                  +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (36)\r\n                     :- * HashAggregate (30)\r\n                     :  +- ReusedExchange (29)\r\n                     +- BroadcastExchange (35)\r\n                        +- * Project (34)\r\n                           +- * Filter (33)\r\n                              +- * ColumnarToRow (32)\r\n                                 +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (31)\r\n\r\n==== w/o this fix: q2 ====\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n* Sort (40)\r\n+- Exchange (39)\r\n   +- * Project (38)\r\n      +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (37)\r\n         :- * Project (26)\r\n         :  +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (25)\r\n         :     :- * HashAggregate (19)\r\n         :     :  +- Exchange (18)\r\n         :     :     +- * HashAggregate (17)\r\n         :     :        +- * Project (16)\r\n         :     :           +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (15)\r\n         :     :              :- Union (9)\r\n         :     :              :  :- * Project (4)\r\n         :     :              :  :  +- * Filter (3)\r\n         :     :              :  :     +- * ColumnarToRow (2)\r\n         :     :              :  :        +- Scan parquet default.web_sales (1)\r\n         :     :              :  +- * Project (8)\r\n         :     :              :     +- * Filter (7)\r\n         :     :              :        +- * ColumnarToRow (6)\r\n         :     :              :           +- Scan parquet default.catalog_sales (5)\r\n         :     :              +- BroadcastExchange (14)\r\n         :     :                 +- * Project (13)\r\n         :     :                    +- * Filter (12)\r\n         :     :                       +- * ColumnarToRow (11)\r\n         :     :                          +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (10)\r\n         :     +- BroadcastExchange (24)\r\n         :        +- * Project (23)\r\n         :           +- * Filter (22)\r\n         :              +- * ColumnarToRow (21)\r\n         :                 +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (20)\r\n         +- BroadcastExchange (36)\r\n            +- * Project (35)\r\n               +- * BroadcastHashJoin Inner BuildRight (34)\r\n                  :- * HashAggregate (28)\r\n                  :  +- ReusedExchange (27)\r\n                  +- BroadcastExchange (33)\r\n                     +- * Project (32)\r\n                        +- * Filter (31)\r\n                           +- * ColumnarToRow (30)\r\n                              +- Scan parquet default.date_dim (29)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis comes from the @cloud-fan comment: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29270#issuecomment-666098964\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes the issue introduced during SPARK-26985.\r\n\r\nSPARK-26985 changes the `putDoubles()` and `putFloats()` methods to respect the platform's endian-ness.  However, that causes the RLE paths in VectorizedRleValuesReader.java to read the RLE entries in parquet as BIG_ENDIAN on big endian platforms (i.e., as is), even though parquet data is always in little endian format.\r\n\r\nThe comments in `WriteableColumnVector.java` say those methods are used for \"ieee formatted doubles in platform native endian\" (or floats), but since the data in parquet is always in little endian format, use of those methods appears to be inappropriate.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the problem with spark-shell:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.types._\r\n    \r\nvar data = Seq(\r\n  (1.0, 0.1),\r\n  (2.0, 0.2),\r\n  (0.3, 3.0),\r\n  (4.0, 4.0),\r\n  (5.0, 5.0))\r\n  \r\nvar df = spark.createDataFrame(data).write.mode(SaveMode.Overwrite).parquet(\"/tmp/data.parquet2\")\r\nvar df2 = spark.read.parquet(\"/tmp/data.parquet2\")\r\ndf2.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nresult:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n+--------------------+--------------------+                                     \r\n|                  _1|                  _2|\r\n+--------------------+--------------------+\r\n|           3.16E-322|-1.54234871366845...|\r\n|         2.0553E-320|         2.0553E-320|\r\n|          2.561E-320|          2.561E-320|\r\n|4.66726145843124E-62|         1.0435E-320|\r\n|        3.03865E-319|-1.54234871366757...|\r\n+--------------------+--------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso tests in ParquetIOSuite that involve float/double data would fail, e.g., \r\n\r\n- basic data types (without binary)\r\n- read raw Parquet file\r\n\r\n/examples/src/main/python/mllib/isotonic_regression_example.py would fail as well.\r\n\r\nPurposed code change is to add `putDoublesLittleEndian()` and `putFloatsLittleEndian()` methods for parquet to invoke, just like the existing `putIntsLittleEndian()` and `putLongsLittleEndian()`.  On little endian platforms they would call `putDoubles()` and `putFloats()`, on big endian they would read the entries as little endian like pre-SPARK-26985.\r\n\r\nNo new unit-test is introduced as the existing ones are actually sufficient.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRLE float/double data in parquet files will not be read back correctly on big endian platforms.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAll unit tests (mvn test) were ran and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark SQL supported filter clause in aggregate, for example:\r\nselect sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;\r\nBut sometimes we can eliminate the filter clause in aggregate.\r\n`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 1) FILTER (WHERE true) FROM testData;`\r\ncould be transformed to\r\n`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 1) FROM testData;`\r\n`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 1) FILTER (WHERE false) FROM testData;`\r\ncould be transformed to\r\n`SELECT 0 FROM testData;`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOptimize the filter clause in

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRefactored code to allow for running benchmark for a single format, or some set of formats.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, there is no way to specify at runtime a single format to benchmark. Would be nice to have it, similar to BuiltInDataSourceWriteBenchmark.\r\n\r\nDepending on if/when https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29352 gets merged, will have to make changes to accommodate the new cases proposed there.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan the benchmarks. Outputs for all cases except for one are unaffected. There is re-ordering of the output in the \"String with Nulls Scan\" case where the \"ParquetReader Vectorized\" case has been pushed down to the bottom:\r\n**before**\r\n`SQL CSV`\r\n`SQL Json`\r\n`SQL Parquet Vectorized`\r\n`SQL Parquet MR`\r\n`ParquetReader Vectorized`\r\n`SQL ORC Vectorized`\r\n`SQL ORC MR`\r\n\r\n**after**\r\n`SQL CSV`\r\n`SQL Json`\r\n`SQL Parquet Vectorized`\r\n`SQL Parquet MR`\r\n`SQL ORC Vectorized`\r\n`SQL ORC MR`\r\n`ParquetReader Vectorized`\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-06T20:02:15Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T00:38:52Z","closed_at":"2020-11-19T00:38:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5e4ad43b7caa4aac0fec5125035e5ee74f06ef9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406606402,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2NDAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/TESTS","name":"TESTS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29381/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29381/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29381/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/43182b9d96dc3ff2b6de7b351b3af9c88fb496ed","head":{"label":"msamirkhan:spark-32561","ref":"spark-32561","sha":"43182b9d96dc3ff2b6de7b351b3af9c88fb496ed","user":{"login":"msamirkhan","id":19244074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjQ0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19244074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan","html_url":"https://github.com/msamirkhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285070079,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODUwNzAwNzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"msamirkhan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"msamirkhan","id":19244074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MjQ0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19244074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan","html_url":"https://github.com/msamirkhan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/msamirkhan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/msamirkhan/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe test creates 10 batches of data  to train the model and expects to see error on test data improves as model is trained.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a reopen for PR #26711 which closed as stale.\r\n\r\n#21390 fixed the same problem on Standalone mode. On YARN, this issue still exists. Especially in a long-running thrift-server, its executors could be dead but the application never stops.\r\nThis patch is very straightforward:\r\nWe create these \"temp_xxx \" files **under the YARN container dirs** when the executor is running in YARN container. So these temp_xxx files could be cleaned when the containers exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, we only clean up the local directories on an application removed. However, when executors die and restart repeatedly, many temp files are left untouched in the local directories, which is undesired behavior and could cause disk space used up gradually. Especially, in a long-running service like Spark thrift-server with dynamic resource allocation disabled, it's very easy to cause local disk full.\r\n\r\nFrom https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21390#issuecomment-391695376, YARN only cleans container local dirs when a container (executor) is exited. But these files are not in container local dirs.\r\n<img width=\"1527\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-11-29 at 4 52 56 PM\"

getFile(filename: String): File` in `DiskBlockManager`.\r\nWe should invoke `def getFile(blockId: BlockId): File` instead, since this method will check a block temporary or not, then storage them to different directories.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a UT and manually test.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-06T11:10:26Z","updated_at":"2020-12-06T00:48:26Z","closed_at":"2020-12-06T00:48:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb680883d08e35a3f384b5b52e0f5f17e771aa78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3520e339e2a9a8daf256ab1396fef9cf85a16354","head":{"label":"LantaoJin:SPARK-30069","ref":"SPARK-30069","sha":"3520e339e2a9a8daf256ab1396fef9cf85a16354","user":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90969496,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDk2OTQ5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"LantaoJin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin/spark","description":"Mirror

A client can create tables using a SerDe which is not available on other clients, for instance `ROW FORMAT SERDE \"com.ibm.spss.hive.serde2.xml.XmlSerDe\"`. In the current implementation, other clients get the following exception while getting views:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: MetaException(message:java.lang.ClassNotFoundException Class com.ibm.spss.hive.serde2.xml.XmlSerDe not found)\r\n```\r\nwhen `com.ibm.spss.hive.serde2.xml.XmlSerDe` is not available.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. For example, `SHOW VIEWS` returns a list of views instead of throwing an exception.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing test suites like:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 \"test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.VersionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n- And manually:\r\n\r\n1. Build Spark with Hive 1.2: `./build/sbt package -Phive-1.2 -Phive -Dhadoop.version=2.8.5`\r\n\r\n2. Run spark-shell with a custom Hive SerDe, for instance download [json-serde-1.3.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar](https://github.com/cdamak/Twitter-Hive/blob/master/json-serde-1.3.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar) from https://github.com/cdamak/Twitter-Hive:\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell --jars ../Downloads/json-serde-1.3.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Create a Hive table using this SerDe:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> :paste\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\nsql(s\"\"\"\r\n  |CREATE TABLE json_table2(page_id INT NOT NULL)\r\n  |ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'\r\n  |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"SHOW TABLES\").show\r\n+--------+-----------+-----------+\r\n|database|  tableName|isTemporary|\r\n+--------+-----------+-----------+\r\n| default|json_table2|      false|\r\n+--------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"SHOW VIEWS\").show\r\n+---------+--------+-----------+\r\n|namespace|viewName|isTemporary|\r\n+---------+--------+-----------+\r\n+---------+--------+-----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Quit from the current `spark-shell` and run it without jars:\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Show views. Without the fix, it throws the exception:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SHOW VIEWS\").show\r\n20/08/06 10:53:36 ERROR log: error in initSerDe: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException Class org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe not found\r\njava.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Class org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe not found\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration.getClassByName(Configuration.java:2273)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.MetaStoreUtils.getDeserializer(MetaStoreUtils.java:385)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Table.getDeserializerFromMetaStore(Table.java:276)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Table.getDeserializer(Table.java:258)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Table.getCols(Table.java:605)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SHOW VIEWS\").show\r\n+---------+--------+-----------+\r\n|namespace|viewName|isTemporary|\r\n+---------+--------+-----------+\r\n+---------+--------+-----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. URL encode the `ASF_PASSWORD` of the release manager.\r\n2. Update the image to install `qpdf` and `jq` dep\r\n3. Increase the JVM HEAM memory for maven build.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRelease script takes hours to run, and if a single failure happens about somewhere midway, then either one has to get down to manually doing stuff or re run the entire script. (This is my understanding) So, I have made the fixes of a few failures, discovered so far.\r\n\r\n1. If the release manager password contains a char, that is not allowed in URL, then it fails the build at the clone spark step.\r\n`git clone \"https://$ASF_USERNAME:$ASF_PASSWORD@$ASF_SPARK_REPO\" -b $GIT_BRANCH`\r\n               \r\n          ^^^ Fails with bad URL\r\n\r\n`ASF_USERNAME` may not be URL encoded, but we need to encode `ASF_PASSWORD`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the release for branch-2.4, using both type of passwords, i.e. passwords with special chars and without it.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-06T06:46:29Z","updated_at":"2020-08-07T08:32:36Z","closed_at":"2020-08-07T08:32:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61d1b07f30fee128d5c9d42c15c38f5fffc5992a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0edf23ec92b2f123a73f5d5299b7fa324b1c8c9f","head":{"label":"ScrapCodes:release-script-fix2","ref":"release-script-fix2","sha":"0edf23ec92b2f123a73f5d5299b7fa324b1c8c9f","user":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17210717,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIxMDcxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"ScrapCodes/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ScrapCodes","id":992952,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjk1Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/992952?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes","html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ScrapCodes/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ScrapCodes/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds unique ID on QueryExecution, so that listeners can leverage the ID to deduplicate redundant calls.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI've observed that Spark calls QueryExecutionListener multiple times on same QueryExecution instance (even same funcName for onSuccess). There's no unique ID on QueryExecution, hence it's a bit tricky if the listener would like to deal with same query execution only once.\r\n\r\nNote that streaming query has both query ID and run ID which can be leveraged as unique ID.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes for who uses query execution listener - they'll see `id` field in QueryExecution and leverage it.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested. I think the change is obvious hence don't think it warrants a new UT. StreamingQueryListener has been using UUID as `queryId` and `runId` so it should work for the same.","created_at":"2020-08-06T06:20:13Z","updated_at":"2020-08-13T02:11:57Z","closed_at":"2020-08-08T22:09:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5db74a8605b3770a17c294977911bfe8bb75a22f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29372/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29372/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29372/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3f1bea27a26f33e20f332e25011da3284aec4986","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-32555","ref":"SPARK-32555","sha":"3f1bea27a26f33e20f332e25011da3284aec4986","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe purpose of this pr is to partial resolve [SPARK-32526](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32526), total of 88 failed and 2 aborted test cases were fixed, the related suite as follow:\r\n\r\n- `DataSourceV2AnalysisBaseSuite` related test cases (71 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `TreeNodeSuite` (1 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `MetadataSuite `(1 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `InferFiltersFromConstraintsSuite `(3 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `StringExpressionsSuite ` (1 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `JacksonParserSuite ` (1 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `HigherOrderFunctionsSuite `(1 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `ExpressionParserSuite` (1 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `CollectionExpressionsSuite `(6 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `SchemaUtilsSuite` (2 FAILED -> Pass)\r\n- `ExpressionSetSuite `(ABORTED -> Pass)\r\n- `ArrayDataIndexedSeqSuite `(ABORTED -> Pass)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main change of this pr as following:\r\n\r\n- `Optimizer` and `Analyzer` are changed to pass compile, `ArrayBuffer` is not a `Seq` in scala 2.13, call `toSeq` method manually to compatible with Scala 2.12\r\n\r\n- `m.mapValues().view.force` pattern return a `Map` in scala 2.12 but return a `IndexedSeq` in scala 2.13, call `toMap` method manually to compatible with Scala 2.12. `TreeNode` are changed to pass `DataSourceV2AnalysisBaseSuite` related test cases and `TreeNodeSuite` failed case.\r\n\r\n- call `toMap` method of `Metadata#hash` method `case map` branch because `map.mapValues` return `Map` in Scala 2.12 and return `MapView` in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n- `impl` contact method of `ExpressionSet` in Scala 2.13 version refer to `ExpressionSet` in Scala 2.12 to support `+ + ` method conform to `ExpressionSet` semantics\r\n\r\n- `GenericArrayData` not accept `ArrayBuffer` input, call `toSeq` when use `ArrayBuffer` construction `GenericArrayData`   for Scala version compatibility \r\n\r\n-  Call `toSeq` in `RandomDataGenerator#randomRow` method to ensure contents of `fields` is `Seq` not `ArrayBuffer`\r\n\r\n-  Call `toSeq` Let `JacksonParser#parse` still return a `Seq` because the check method of `JacksonParserSuite#\"skipping rows using pushdown filters\"` dependence on `Seq` type\r\n- Call `toSeq` in `AstBuilder#visitFunctionCall`, otherwise `ctx.argument.asScala.map(expression)` is `Buffer` in Scala 2.13\r\n\r\n- Add a `LongType` match to `ArraySetLike.nullValueHolder`\r\n\r\n- Add a `sorted` to ensure `duplicateColumns` string in `SchemaUtils.checkColumnNameDuplication` method error message have a deterministic order\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe need to support a Scala 2.13 build.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.12: Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n\r\n- Scala 2.13: Do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndev/change-scala-version.sh 2.13\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests  -pl sql/catalyst -Pscala-2.13 -am\r\nmvn test -pl

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark SQL supported filter clause in aggregate, for example:\r\n`select sum(distinct id) filter (where sex = 'man') from student;`\r\nBut sometimes we can eliminate the filter clause in aggregate.\r\n`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 1) FILTER (WHERE true) FROM testData;`\r\ncould be transformed to\r\n`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 1) FROM testData;`\r\n`SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 1) FILTER (WHERE false) FROM testData;`\r\ncould be transformed to\r\n`SELECT 0 FROM testData;`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOptimize the filter clause in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf graceful decommissioning is enabled, Spark's dynamic scaling uses this instead of directly killing executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen scaling down Spark we should avoid triggering recomputes as much as possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nHopefully their jobs run faster or at the same speed. It also enables experimental shuffle service free dynamic scaling when graceful decommissioning is enabled (using the same code as the shuffle tracking dynamic scaling).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFor now I've extended the ExecutorAllocationManagerSuite for both core & streaming.","created_at":"2020-08-06T00:32:29Z","updated_at":"2020-08-13T01:41:08Z","closed_at":"2020-08-13T00:08:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11e1522582874a1876d247a5d08708c8b9e07c38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984378631,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0Mzc4NjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAM","name":"DSTREAM","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/29367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/29367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e970cb10147fb64533f5088edc3a448b5ef198cf","head":{"label":"holdenk:SPARK-31198-use-graceful-decommissioning-as-part-of-dynamic-scaling","ref":"SPARK-31198-use-graceful-decommissioning-as-part-of-dynamic-scaling","sha":"e970cb10147fb64533f5088edc3a448b5ef198cf","user":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17235154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNTE1NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"holdenk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"holdenk","id":59893,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODkz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59893?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk","html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/holdenk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/holdenk/spark","description":"Mirror

The error message from `_infer_schema` is changed.\r\nBefore:\r\n\"not supported type: foo\"\r\nAfter:\r\n\"Column bar contains not supported type: foo\"\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated the existing unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nGet table names directly from a sequence of Hive tables in `HiveClientImpl.listTablesByType()` by skipping conversions Hive tables to Catalog tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA Hive metastore can be shared across many clients. A client can create tables using a SerDe which is not available on other clients, for instance `ROW FORMAT SERDE \"com.ibm.spss.hive.serde2.xml.XmlSerDe\"`. In the current implementation, other clients get the following exception while getting views:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: MetaException(message:java.lang.ClassNotFoundException Class com.ibm.spss.hive.serde2.xml.XmlSerDe not found)\r\n```\r\nwhen `com.ibm.spss.hive.serde2.xml.XmlSerDe` is not available.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. For example, `SHOW VIEWS` returns a list of views instead of throwing an exception.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- By existing test suites like:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 \"test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.VersionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n- And manually:\r\n\r\n1. Build Spark with Hive 1.2: `./build/sbt package -Phive-1.2 -Phive -Dhadoop.version=2.8.5`\r\n\r\n2. Run spark-shell with a custom Hive SerDe, for instance download [json-serde-1.3.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar](https://github.com/cdamak/Twitter-Hive/blob/master/json-serde-1.3.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar) from https://github.com/cdamak/Twitter-Hive:\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell --jars ../Downloads/json-serde-1.3.8-jar-with-dependencies.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Create a Hive table using this SerDe:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> :paste\r\n// Entering paste mode (ctrl-D to finish)\r\n\r\nsql(s\"\"\"\r\n  |CREATE TABLE json_table2(page_id INT NOT NULL)\r\n  |ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'\r\n  |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n// Exiting paste mode, now interpreting.\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"SHOW TABLES\").show\r\n+--------+-----------+-----------+\r\n|database|  tableName|isTemporary|\r\n+--------+-----------+-----------+\r\n| default|json_table2|      false|\r\n+--------+-----------+-----------+\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"SHOW VIEWS\").show\r\n+---------+--------+-----------+\r\n|namespace|viewName|isTemporary|\r\n+---------+--------+-----------+\r\n+---------+--------+-----------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Quit from the current `spark-shell` and run it without jars:\r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/spark-shell\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Show views. Without the fix, it throws the exception:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> sql(\"SHOW VIEWS\").show\r\n20/08/06 10:53:36 ERROR log: error in initSerDe: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException Class

It can expand 2^4 times of original data size.\r\nNow we specify the spark.sql.optimizer.projections.size=4.The Expand will be split into 2^4/4 smallExpand.It can reduce the shuffle pressure and improve performance in multidimensional analysis when data is huge.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunBenchmark(\"cube multianalysis agg\") {\r\n      val N = 20 << 20\r\n\r\n      val benchmark = new Benchmark(\"cube

However, currently it only supports addition of missing partitions. If there are any partitions which are present in metastore but not on the FileSystem, it should also delete them so that it truly repairs the table metadata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisallow `FileSystem.get(Configuration conf)` in Scala style check by default and suggest developers use `FileSystem.get(URI uri, Configuration conf)` or `Path.getFileSystem()` instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe method `FileSystem.get(Configuration conf)` will return a default FileSystem instance if the conf `fs.file.impl` is not set. This can cause file not found exception on reading a target path of non-default file system, e.g. S3. It is hard to discover such a mistake via unit tests.\r\nIf we disallow it in Scala style check by default and suggest developers use `FileSystem.get(URI uri, Configuration conf)` or `Path.getFileSystem(Configuration conf)`, we can reduce potential regression and PR review effort.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nManually run scala style check and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR lets the logger log timestamp based on local time zone during test.\r\n`SparkFunSuite` fixes the default time zone to America/Los_Angeles so the timestamp logged in unit-tests.log is also based on the fixed time zone.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's confusable for developers whose time zone is not America/Los_Angeles.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nRun existing tests and confirmed uint-tests.log.\r\nIf your local time zone is America/Los_Angeles, you can test by setting the environment variable `TZ` like as follows.\r\n```\r\n$ TZ=Asia/Tokyo build/sbt \"testOnly org.apache.spark.executor.ExecutorSuite\"\r\n$ tail

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanges to Reading/Writing Avro file format. There are 8 commits in total. The first 3 are simpler changes to AvroSerializer and AvroDeserializer, while the remaining 5 are to create native reader/writer for Avro in Spark. The attached pdf lists the improvements with each. Even if the native reader/write is not accepted, the simpler changes to AvroSerializer and AvroDeserializer also make an impact on performance.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe had found that Spark performance was slow in these cases compared with PIG. Attached pdf has info on improvements, but summarily the times (in seconds) go down as follows in each case:\r\nRead:\r\nNested Structs: 75 -> 46\r\nArray of Struct: 47 -> 17\r\n\r\nWrite\r\nNested Structs: 147 -> 36\r\nArray of Struct: 139 -> 34\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan benchmarks (please see the PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29352 for [SPARK-32531](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32531) for details on added benchmarks) and tests, with branch-3.0 as base, on jdk-1.8\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChanges to Serializing/Deserializing ORC file format. There are 3 commits. Attached PDF has info on improvements in each commit. Essentially pushing a lot of processing, which can be done solely based on the data schema, to the initialization stage so that it is not repeated for each row of data. Eg, before it would convert catalyst schema to orc schema and recursively create orc structs, for each row of data. Now, it only has to do the conversion once at the schema level.\r\n\r\nI have left the PR as 3 commits to easily match with the benchmark pdf.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark performance is really slow for these cases. Attached pdf has info on improvements, but summarily the times (in seconds) go down as follows in each case:\r\nRead:\r\nNested Structs: 184 -> 44\r\nArray of Struct: 66 -> 15\r\n\r\nWrite\r\nNested Structs: 543 -> 39\r\nArray of Struct: 330 -> 37\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan benchmarks (please see the PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29352 for [SPARK-32531](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-32531) for additional details on added benchmarks) and tests, with branch-3.0 as base, on jdk-1.8\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a `FileNotFoundException` try catch block while adding a new entry to history server application listing to skip the non-existing path.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf there are a large number (>100k) of applications log dir, listing the log dir will take a few seconds. After getting the path list some applications might have finished already, and the filename will change from `foo.inprogress` to `foo`.\r\n\r\nIt leads to a problem when adding an entry to the listing, querying file status like `fileSizeForLastIndex` will throw out a `FileNotFoundException` exception if the application was finished. And the exception will abort current loop, in a busy cluster, it will make history server couldn't list and load any application log.\r\n\r\n```\r\n20/08/03 15:17:23 ERROR FsHistoryProvider: Exception

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe newly added test fails Jenkins maven jobs, see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29303#discussion_r464729021\r\n\r\nWe move the test from `ThriftServerWithSparkContextSuite` to `SparkMetadataOperationSuite`, the former uses an embedded thrift server where the server and the client are in the same JVM process and the latter forks a new process to start the server where the server and client are isolated.\r\nThe sbt runner seems to be fine with the test in the `ThriftServerWithSparkContextSuite`, but the maven runner with `scalates`t plugin will face the classloader issue as we will switch classloader to the one in the `sharedState` which is not the one that hive uses to load some classes. This is more like an issue that belongs to the maven runner or the `scalatest`.\r\nSo in this PR, we simply move it to bypass the issue.\r\n\r\nBTW, we should test against the way of using embedded thrift server to verify whether it is just a maven issue or not, there could be some use cases with this API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nJenkins recovery\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nmodified
