part of #46045 we are moving all providers to the new structure, each with it's own pyproject.toml. However we noticed that constraint generation is somewhat broken during the move:\r\n\r\n* providers moved to the new structure disappeared from pypi constraints\r\n* http provider in SOME PRs started to appear in \"source constraints\"\r\n\r\nBoth should not happen:\r\n\r\n* pypi constraints should contain all providers (latest versions in PyPI)\r\n* source providers should contain no providers - only their dependencies\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons for those two issues, and this PR fixes both:\r\n\r\n1) The PyPI providers were removed because `uv pip install .` without\r\n   editable flag is currently - pretty unexpectedly - installing\r\n   local workspaced providers rather than install them from PyPI and\r\n   there are no controls to disable it.\r\n\r\n   Workaround for that is that during constraint generation we\r\n   remove temporarily all providers from workspace definition in the\r\n   pyproject.toml - this way providers are installed from PyPI.\r\n   Feature request to handle it has been raised in the\r\n   https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/10991\r\n\r\n2) The http provider was added to the constraint in PRs where\r\n   the http provider is a required dependency (for example in\r\n   discord provider). Since the http provider is not yet\r\n   migrated, discord installation in workspace will pull it\r\n   from PyPI rather than from the local workspace.\r\n\r\n   This has been fixed by simply migrating the http provider\r\n   to the new structure,\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Purpose\r\nUpdates task state the Adds 2 missing states (\"skipped\", \"deferred\") to the diagram, with more details on state transition conditions.\r\n\r\n - [Task Instance State Documentation (v2.10.4)](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.10.4/core-concepts/tasks.html#task-instances)\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n - Adds missing states to the diagram (\"skipped\" and \"deferred\")\r\n - Adds missing condition nodes to state transition\r\n - Adds \"trigger\" component (which handles deferred tasks) to the diagram\r\n - Coverts multiple conditional branch in the graph into sequence (multi-staged) of binary conditional branches\r\n - Split states into three categories: \"shared states\", \"states only for sensors\", and \"states only for deferrable tasks\"\r\n - Uses different icons to differentiate task states and Airflow components\r\n - Uses `diagrams` library for automated plotting and pre-commit integration; rename \"task_lifecycle_diagram\" to \"diagram_task_lifecycle\" to comply with pre-commit condition\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n - #40185 \r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

#42720\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] Implementation\r\n- [x] E2E Test\r\n- [x] Unit Test\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- Fix the error on the XCom filter page in the UI, which is preventing users from using values as filter conditions to select the XCom records they want.\r\n\r\n## Change details\r\n- `airflow/www/utils.py`:\r\n    - Add `XComFilterStartsWith`, `XComFilterEndsWith`, `XComFilterEqual`, `XComFilterContains`, `XComFilterNotStartsWith`, `XComFilterNotEndsWith`, `XComFilterNotContains`, and `XComFilterNotEqual` classes to handle different types of filtering for XCom values.\r\n        - Since the `value` is stored in the `xcom` table in PostgreSQL's `bytea` format, we first need to convert it into a UTF-8 string. Additionally, because the value content is enclosed in double quotes before being encoded as `bytea` and stored in the database, we also need to remove the leading and trailing double quotes from the UTF-8 formatted value in order to compare it with the user's input filter condition.\r\n            - describe `xcom` table:\r\n                - ![截圖 2025-01-26 下午8 46 14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d1bf261-eb7a-4026-b8cc-422133c08482)\r\n                - ![截圖 2025-01-26 下午8 43 39](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c5e5b7f-b62b-4687-ab1f-263af58e9452)\r\n                - <img width=\"753\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午1 03 18\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/347274a1-03c2-42c3-af28-493cc5725c54\" />\r\n\r\n    - Updated the `AirflowFilterConverter` class to include the new XCom filters in its conversion table.\r\n    - Add the `is_xcom_value` method to check if a column name corresponds to an XCom value.\r\n- `tests/www/test_utils.py`:\r\n    - Add a unit test case `TestXComFilter` to test whether the SQLAlchemy call sequence behaves as expected.\r\n\r\n## How did you test?\r\n- Unit Test in `tests/www/test_utils.py`\r\n- E2E Test\r\n    - I used the [example code provided by Airflow](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-passing-data-between-tasks/#example-dag-using-xcoms) to push the XCom content to the database during DAG execution, and then I operated the XCom filter on the Web UI. \r\n        - <img width=\"1465\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午12 39 49\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6efecd1c-4277-4995-959d-1d3252619e92\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n    - Below are the demo screenshots for each of the functionalities.\r\n        - <details>\r\n            <summary>Demo screenshots:</summary>\r\n\r\n            - Starts With:\r\n            - <img width=\"1470\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午12 40 17\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c098e377-0887-41ce-b457-1f51fd24079e\" />\r\n\r\n            - Ends With:\r\n            - <img width=\"1470\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午12 40 46\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c73be2-0987-4ac5-9ac1-ea1f0f0e6a46\" />\r\n\r\n            - Equal:\r\n            - <img width=\"1470\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午12 41 07\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9e957ea-ddea-4780-85c8-7ca81184599e\" />\r\n            - Contains:\r\n            - <img width=\"1470\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午12 41 24\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a9fd579-561a-4a08-8592-621191dd31b5\" />\r\n\r\n            - Not Starts With:\r\n            - <img width=\"1470\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午12 41 37\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d079b9d5-e3bb-421a-a816-54e04a81b71c\" />\r\n\r\n            - Not Ends With:\r\n            - <img width=\"1470\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午12 42 16\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ba47b0c-37c5-41f7-a1cc-23eb15813528\" />\r\n\r\n            - Not Contains With:\r\n            - <img width=\"1470\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午12 42 34\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67fc016e-4ebf-4cf7-85d9-78dd0b79a409\" />\r\n\r\n            - Not Equal:\r\n            - <img width=\"1470\" alt=\"截圖 2025-01-27 下午12 43 07\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c50ceb5c-0797-4a9b-9cd1-b50db00c6c7e\" />\r\n\r\n        </details>\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
