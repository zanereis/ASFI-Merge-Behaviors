docs added that mentioned the [proper](https://github.com/astronomer/airflow/blob/master/airflow/executors/kubernetes_executor.py#L495) way to override the `pod_template_file`.

a PR here that seeks to simplify Airflow's [CONTRIBUTING.rst](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst).\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this PR:\r\n\r\n- Removes most sections under \"Contributions\" to a single \"Welcome\" section\r\n- Simplifies the overview \"Contribution Workflow\" to actually match the steps provided\r\n- Notably, this PR creates a new top-level `contributing` folder on apache/airflow, that then hosts 3 files: \r\n    - `CONTRIBUTE-CODE.rst` (converted from `contributing.rst`)\r\n    - `CONTRIBUTE-DOCS.rst` (_new_)\r\n    - `CONTRIBUTE-PROVIDERS.rst` (_new_)\r\n    - `CONTRIBUTE-QUICK_START.rst` (renamed from `CONTRIBUTORS_QUICK_START.rst`\r\n- `contributing.rst` will remain as a top-level directory, and act as a short resource that links out to the above docs\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that if a person wants to contribute to Airflow, we should give them tailored instructions depending on the part of the project they want to make changes to. Additionally, most of the actions I've taken here were talked about at our bi-weekly \"Issue Triage\" meeting ([Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19y8AfZ56mvIo1AjxoFz0Ebzj_9VQJ6YTr0Acj64W1L4/edit)).\r\n\r\n**Additional Notes:**\r\n- The `CONTRIBUTE-DOCS.rst` file does not have much content at all - for now I didn't create new content, but just ported over existing language in what was `contributing.rst`. Would we be comfortable merging this PR as-is? The rest of the files should generally be looked at in more detail as well.\r\n- I imagine these files are linked in quite a few places...given the new file paths I'm suggesting, we'll need to make sure to either create redirects or convert all existing references to the new paths.\r\n- Need to re-link [this section in the README](https://github.com/apache/airflow#who-maintains-apache-airflow):\r\n     > If you would like to become a maintainer, please review the [Apache Airflow committer requirements](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#guidelines-to-become-an-airflow-committer).\r\n\r\ncc: @kaxil @vikramkoka @eladkal Before I move forward with this and polish what I have here, does this structure I'm proposing make sense/is feasible? I'm not entirely familiar with the typical structure of these .rst files, so I want to make sure this is \"ok\" to do in a single PR. Let me know on general thoughts, and I'll do some more work on this.","created_at":"2021-02-10T16:28:43Z","updated_at":"2021-08-18T00:05:23Z","closed_at":"2021-08-18T00:05:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cd348f66c27f682757cb4c32f0dec470b3aa4e0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

PR builds off of and supersedes @jaydesl's work on his [PR](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/11769) to move forward with properly following [helm's rbac best practices](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/rbac/). This PR updates every potential pod that can be deployed to include the option to either create or use an existing service account. This is the first step towards supporting environments where users have the [PodSecurityPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#podsecuritypolicy) admission controller enabled without forcing such users to provide any additional permissions to the default service account in the namespace this is deployed to.\r\n\r\ncloses:

broke the ability\r\nto run ``airflow upgrade_check`` command.\r\n\r\nWhen ``airflow upgrade_check`` is run, the airflow cli runs\r\n`airflow.upgrade.checker.register_arguments` function.\r\n\r\nThis function registers all arguments and sets the default function to run.\r\n\r\nSince we don't want to handle the logic in ``airflow``, we have a hack\r\nto only run anything via that ``run`` command. So the logic about\r\nchecking for args should be in it.\r\n\r\n#13392 removed ``subparser.set_defaults(func=run)``.\r\n\r\nDue to which I get the following:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ airflow upgrade_check --list\r\n\r\nPlease install apache-airflow-upgrade-check distribution from PyPI to perform upgrade checks\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause default is not set in `checker.py`, it uses one set in\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/v1-10-stable/airflow/bin/cli.py#L4248\r\n\r\nand hence just prints `Please install apache-airflow-upgrade-check distribution from PyPI to perform upgrade checks`.\r\n\r\n**After the fix in this PR**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n❯ airflow upgrade_check --list\r\n\r\nUpgrade Checks:\r\n- VersionCheckRule: Check for latest versions of apache-airflow and checker\r\n- AirflowMacroPluginRemovedRule: Remove airflow.AirflowMacroPlugin class\r\n- BaseOperatorMetaclassRule: Ensure users are not using custom metaclasses in custom operators\r\n- ChainBetweenDAGAndOperatorNotAllowedRule: Chain between DAG and operator not allowed.\r\n- ConnTypeIsNotNullableRule: Connection.conn_type is not nullable\r\n- CustomExecutorsRequireFullPathRule: Custom Executors now require full path\r\n- DatabaseVersionCheckRule: Check versions of PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite to ease upgrade to Airflow 2.0\r\n- DbApiRule: Hooks that run DB functions must inherit from DBApiHook\r\n- FernetEnabledRule: Fernet is enabled by default\r\n- GCPServiceAccountKeyRule: GCP service account key deprecation\r\n- HostnameCallable: Unify hostname_callable option in core section\r\n- ImportChangesRule: Changes in import paths of hooks, operators, sensors and others\r\n- LegacyUIDeprecated: Legacy UI is deprecated by default\r\n- LoggingConfigurationRule: Logging configuration has been moved to new section\r\n- MesosExecutorRemovedRule: Removal of Mesos Executor\r\n- NoAdditionalArgsInOperatorsRule: No additional argument allowed in BaseOperator.\r\n- PodTemplateFileRule: Users must set a kubernetes.pod_template_file value\r\n- SendGridEmailerMovedRule: SendGrid email uses old airflow.contrib module\r\n- SparkJDBCOperatorConnIdRule: Check Spark JDBC Operator default connection name\r\n- TaskHandlersMovedRule: Changes in import path of remote task handlers\r\n- UniqueConnIdRule: Connection.conn_id is not unique\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

change enables easy switching between GitHub Package Registry\r\nand GitHub Container Registry by simply adding GITHUB_REGISTRY\r\nsecret to be either `docker.package.github.com` or `ghcr.io`.\r\n\r\nThis makes it easy to switch only by the Apache Airflow repository\r\nrun builds, as it requires preparation of images (to make them\r\npublic and to add permissions to manage them) after they got\r\ncreated for the first time. GitHub Package Registry works\r\nout-of-the-box but it is less stable and considered a legacy,\r\nalso it does not allow image retention.\r\n\r\nDocumentation has been updated to reflect the reasoning of choosing\r\nthis solution as well as describing maintenance processes around\r\nimages (including adding new Python version)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR is to address requests formulated in the comments to PR #13984.

As requested by @ashb the `open_maybe_zipped` function unit test, instead of relying on mocks, now actually reads a test file contents, zipped and plain, and verifies that the returned file content is string in both cases.","created_at":"2021-02-06T14:44:23Z","updated_at":"2021-02-17T09:45:18Z","closed_at":"2021-02-17T09:45:18Z","merged_at":"2021-02-17T09:45:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"faa6668f3e6dba1d835840d6a134c90a707fa8c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full

commit adds a decorator: `@retry_db_transaction` to retry\r\nMethods and functions when there is an `OperationalError`. This unifies\r\nthe retry configs in a single place and the adds logging.\r\n\r\nThis makes the code clean and avoids repeatation. This decorator\r\nshould not be used when using `@provide_session`.\r\n\r\nWe already have `run_with_db_retries` to retry code-blocks with the\r\nsame default.\r\n\r\n`@retry_db_transaction` leverages `run_with_db_retries` (which uses tenacity)\r\nto retry.\r\n\r\nYou can use this decorator both with and without passing args to it:\r\n\r\n`@retry_db_transaction` uses the default configs (example: 3 retries)\r\nIf for whatever reason we want to change the number of retries for\r\na certain function, we can use pass `retries` to decorator,\r\nexmaple: `@retry_db_transaction(retries=2)`\r\n\r\nThe decorator also accepts kwargs where developers can pass\r\ndifferent keyword arguments to `tenacity.Retrying` object.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

There were a few other fields which could easily be templated so I added them as well.\r\n\r\n2) Don't use the `global-dataproc.googleapis.com:443` URL when creating dataproc clients. \r\n\r\nThis was partially done in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/12907 but the other two client creation methods were not updated. Using the `global-dataproc` URL results in 404s when trying to create clusters in the `global` region. \r\n\r\nWe don't need to specify the default endpoint as it is used by default in the dataproc client library:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/googleapis/python-dataproc/blob/6f27109faf03dd13f25294e57960f0d9e1a9fa27/google/cloud/dataproc_v1beta2/services/cluster_controller/client.py#L117\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^

#11982 \r\n\r\nSchedulerJob doesn't actually call the executors `end` method when the scheduler receives SIGINT/SIGTERM or when there is an exception (e.g. database connectivity issues).\r\n\r\nIf you are using KuberenetesExecutor, this results in the scheduler not actually exiting.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, if you are using LocalExecutor, this results in the scheduler not dealing with the tasks it is currently running. By ensuring the executors `end` method is called, LocalExecutor will now wait around until the tasks complete or a second SIGINT/SIGTERM/exception. I believe we need to document that behavior change somewhere, I just haven't looked where yet.","created_at":"2021-02-04T22:44:08Z","updated_at":"2021-04-11T11:56:45Z","closed_at":"2021-04-11T11:56:45Z","merged_at":"2021-04-11T11:56:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"16902d0437623c1aecf8f40e96228e20f85941f8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"turbaszek","id":9528307,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk1MjgzMDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9528307?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek","html_url":"https://github.com/turbaszek","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/turbaszek/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

fixes the test `test_should_load_plugins_from_property`, which is currently quarantined as a \"Heisentest\".\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior:\r\nThe test currently fails because the records that it expects to find in the logger are not present.\r\n\r\nCause:\r\nWhile the test sets the logger as \"DEBUG\", it doesn't specify which logger to update. Python loggers are namespaced (typically based on the current file's path), but this has to be defined explicitly. In the absence of a specified logger, any attempts to lookup will return the BaseLogger instance.\r\n\r\nThe test is therefore updating the log level for the base logger, but when the test runs, the `plugins_manager.py` file defines a namespaced logger `log = logging.getLogger(__name__)` used throughout the file. Since a different logger is used, the original log level, in this case `INFO`, is used. `INFO` is a higher level than `DEBUG`, so the calls to `log.debug()` get filtered out, and when the test looks for log records it finds an empty list.\r\n\r\nFix:\r\nJust specify which logger to update when modifying the log level in the test.","created_at":"2021-02-04T01:54:00Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T10:09:10Z","closed_at":"2021-02-04T10:09:06Z","merged_at":"2021-02-04T10:09:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"e80ad5ac995fe05477ad497c11391872faa2317a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1780460538,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzgwNDYwNTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:plugins","name":"area:plugins","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full

this, fields on the connection form were dynamically changed by adding and removing the \"hide\" CSS class. If a provider were to add a field that requires validation (e.g. InputRequired), or if a different field type was used (e.g. NumberField), the entire form would be unsaveable, even if the currently selected connection type had nothing to do with that provider.\r\n\r\nThis change takes a different approach; upon loading, the DOM elements for all extra fields are saved into a Map, then removed from the DOM tree. When another connection type is selected, these elements are restored into the DOM.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we still can't use `wtforms.validators.InputRequired` because of server-side validation, however, a provider can subclass `InputRequired` and conditionally validate based on connection type. Here's an example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass InputRequired(wtforms.validators.InputRequired):\r\n    field_flags = ('required', )\r\n\r\n    def __call__(self, form, field):\r\n        conn_type = form.conn_type.data\r\n        if conn_type == MyHook.conn_type:\r\n            super().__call__(form, field)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncloses: #13985 \r\n\r\nNote: I wasn't sure about the conventions for JavaScript files here; some lines had semicolons, some didn't. In my change, I just made sure that every line ended with a semicolon, but I didn't want to change the other lines to avoid creating too much noise.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I'm unsure about is Airflow's browser support policy. This change does away with a lot of jQuery use, instead opting for standard DOM APIs. In particular, `Array.from` is used, which means that this won't be supported by any version of Internet Explorer. Microsoft themselves are EOLing IE by 17th August 2021 for their own products, so not sure how much of an issue this is.","created_at":"2021-02-03T20:31:55Z","updated_at":"2021-02-11T13:59:24Z","closed_at":"2021-02-11T13:59:22Z","merged_at":"2021-02-11T13:59:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"98bbe5aec578a012c1544667bf727688da1dadd4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2458345138,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDU4MzQ1MTM4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/okay%20to%20merge","name":"okay to merge","color":"64e05c","default":false,"description":"It's ok to merge this PR as it does not require more tests"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

large number of tasks takes a long time. Most of the time is spent at this line in `clear_task_instances` (more than 95% time). This slowness sometimes causes the webserver to timeout because the `web_server_worker_timeout` is hit.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        # Clear all reschedules related to the ti to clear\r\n        session.query(TR).filter(\r\n            TR.dag_id == ti.dag_id,\r\n            TR.task_id == ti.task_id,\r\n            TR.execution_date == ti.execution_date,\r\n            TR.try_number == ti.try_number,\r\n        ).delete()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis line is very slow because it's deleting `TaskReschedule` rows in a for loop one by one. \r\n\r\nThis PR simply changes this code to delete `TaskReschedule` in a single sql query with a bunch of `OR` conditions. It's effectively doing the same, but now it's much faster. Simple profiling shows that it's at least seven times faster when deleting thousands of `TaskReschedule`.","created_at":"2021-02-03T14:29:30Z","updated_at":"2021-05-29T08:21:39Z","closed_at":"2021-02-10T14:07:19Z","merged_at":"2021-02-10T14:07:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"9036ce20c140520d3f9d5e0f83b5ebfded07fa7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2451280808,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDUxMjgwODA4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/full%20tests%20needed","name":"full

the issue wherein regardless of what role anonymous users are assigned (via the `AUTH_ROLE_PUBLIC` env var), they can't see any DAGs.\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior causes:\r\nAnonymous users are handled as a special case by Airflow's DAG-related security methods (`.has_access()` and `.get_accessible_dags()`). Rather than checking the `AUTH_ROLE_PUBLIC` value to check for role permissions, the methods reject access to view or edit any DAGs.\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR:\r\nRather than hardcoding permission rules inside the security methods, this change checks the `AUTH_ROLE_PUBLIC` value and gives anonymous users all permissions linked to the designated role. \r\n\r\n**This places security in the hands of the Airflow users. If the value is set to `Admin`, anonymous users will have full admin functionality.**\r\n\r\nThis also changes how the `Public` role is created. Currently, the `Public` role is created automatically by Flask App Builder. This PR explicitly declares `Public` as a default role with no permissions in `security.py`. This change makes it easier to test.\r\n\r\ncloses: #13340
