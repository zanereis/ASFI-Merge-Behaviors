adds some basic benchmarks to prove that the generic registration works as well as the generated version. This isn't really perfect - it largely looks at pieces of the overall flow and doesn't provide a comprehensive full run of the DoFn, and it misses some cases (e.g. iters/emitters). This is because:\r\n\r\n1) We can't have these benchmarks in the exec package because including the register package there induces a circular dependency and go test throws.\r\n2) Much of the stuff we'd like to be able to easily test is private in exec. An example is that makeEmit is private, and its pretty challenging to test that specific functionality.\r\n\r\nI didn't try _too_ hard to work around those constraints because I expect that once we've built up a decent history of load test runs that will actually be a better way to show that generic registration is just as good for more \"real\" use cases.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This PR expands its functionality to also be able to export to Google BigQuery by introducing a new method, namely `exportFhirResourceToBigQuery`, to `HealthcareApiClient` and modifying the existing `DoFn` `@ProcessElement` method to call the appropriate export method based on the input URI.\r\n\r\nAlso, changed the export behavior to not return a `PCollection` of the exported resources and instead output the URI where the store was exported to. @msbukal and I agreed that this would be a better approach because it gives more flexibility to the user by allowing them to chain with transforms tailored for reading resources.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

appears that the there could be multiple UnboundedSourceAsSDFWrapperFns creating RestrictionTrackers for same restriction. This led to duplicate records being produce because each UnboundedSourceAsSDFWrapperFn have separate reader cache, and each UnboundedSourceAsSDFWrapperFn will create new UnboundedSourceReader separately when not initialized. \r\n\r\nMaking source reader cache global so that the reader could be effectively checked out and this avoid duplication of same source readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Valentyn mentioned on the Jira Ticket, if a worker is marked as temporarily offline and an Inventory job started during that process, then the job is going to stuck and it's necessary to cancel it manually and run it again later, even if the worker is back online it can not retake the job. \r\n\r\nThe reason behind that was the eligibility option set in the code, [Eligibility options ](https://jenkinsci.github.io/job-dsl-plugin/#path/javaposse.jobdsl.dsl.helpers.BuildParametersContext.nodeParam-eligibility), by changing it to all nodes the job will continue it's execution after the worker is online again.\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't affect the stablished workers-job mapping, as the allowed nodes and default node options are already set.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change improves the error message when a channel split fails with the full split state  and avoids a performance issue WRT listing all the split indices in the error message as the string conversion is expensive.\r\n\r\nInstead of listing all splits, since we've already sorted them all, we simply list the count and the first and last split indices. This gives us enough information to see what happened to cause the failure, which the current message lacks. The length and first and last would let a debugger determine if the range was complete or not.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

package contains an io-connector for [CDAP](https://cdap.atlassian.net/wiki/home) sources and sinks.\r\n`CdapIO` is the primary class used in working with the connector in a pipeline. It contains static `PTransform` classes that represents reads/writes within the I/O (e.g. `Read`, `Write`).\r\n\r\n![package drawio (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17278361/157455025-1a58eb9d-0930-4a83-aaa2-9c226fe0281d.png)\r\n\r\n`CdapIO.<~>read()` method method starts constructing a `CdapIO.Read` transform, it receives a type parameters`<~>` that specify the output type for CDAP source.\r\nThe `Read` class implements an interface similar to the builder pattern and has simple `withX()` methods for passing configuration and other settings needed before start reading from CDAP source:\r\n- `withCdapPluginClass()` - pass a source/sink plugin class marked with CDAP `@Plugin` annotation. (e.g. `ZendeskBatchSource.class`) \r\n- `withPluginConfig()`- pass a corresponding `PluginConfig` object (e.g. `ZendeskBatchSourceConfig.class`)\r\n- `withKeyClass()` - specify the key class for the output (e.g. `NullWritable.class`)\r\n- `withValueClass()`- specify the value class for the output (e.g. `StructuredRecord.class`)\r\n\r\nInside the `.withCdapPluginClass()` method, the `CdapPlugin` object is constructed. `CdapPlugin` object contains the following information about CDAP plugin:\r\n- Bounded/Unbounded\r\n- Input/Output\r\n- `BatchContextImpl` object for stubbing some CDAP-specific behavior\r\n- Format / Key / Value classes needed for filling Hadoop `Configuration` object\r\n- `T cdapPluginObj` for performing `prepareRun()` call before reading\r\n\r\nThe following steps are performed in the `Read.expand()` method:\r\n- Validating that all configs and other obligatory fields are set\r\n- Call `CdapPlugin.prepareRun()` method before reading (see javadoc)\r\n- Construct the needed `Read` transform depending on whether the `CdapPlugin` is bounded / unbounded:\r\n- - For bounded sources `HadoopFormatIO.<K, V>read()` method is called passing filled Hadoop `Configuration` object.\r\n- - For unbounded sources `SparkReceiverIO.<~>read()` method is called.\r\n\r\n![156-seq drawio(2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17278361/155947282-342fa263-66c4-45f9-9ac1-2863f563138e.png)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the StorageWrite stream append client cache to use a list of entries instead of just one entry per stream.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of the cases the default configuration would be sufficient to address the ingestion volume, but there are cases were the ingestion will need a higher level of parallelism. Setting `--numStorageWriteApiStreams=X` to a value > 1 will help to increase the ingestion parallelism level, users should be mindful of changing this number to a high one since the number of open connections will rapidly scale with the number of workers potentially reaching BigQuery quota/limits (see: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/quotas#write-api-limits).   \r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

has been inadvertently disabled as it branches on `utils.check_compiled('apache_beam.coders')` which is always false (coders is not compiled, coders_impl is). It turns out the test should now test under cython and non-cython, so this PR removes the branch, and fixes a few test issues that were masked.\r\n\r\nThere's one more test issue that I'm not sure how

users to return ProcessContinuation interfaces from SDFs, allowing the writing of native streaming DoFns.

Also adds unit test cases that depend on being able to return those continuations for validation and could not be added prior. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR fixes BEAM-10785 by adding the `coder` argument from `WriteToBigQuery` to `JsonRowWriter` to enable users to modify the coder for various reasons on batch pipeline. The `coder` argument will be defaulted to `RowAsDictJsonCoder` if user didn't specify.\r\n\r\nThis modification needs to add `coder` argument on below classes and functions. This PR also applies changes for them.\r\n\r\n* `BigQueryBatchFileLoads`\r\n* `WriteRecordsToFile`\r\n* `WriteGroupedRecordsToFile`\r\n* `_make_new_file_writer()`\r\n* `JsonRowWriter`\r\n\r\nThis version was tested on `DataflowRunner` and there were no any problems while using custom coder. But this PR does not have any additional unit tests now, so it will be great if reviewers can provide some directions about appropriate unit tests. Please let me know if there are any concerns on this PR. Thank you!\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pipeline returns `errors` when trying to insert rows that do not match the BigQuery table schema. `errors` is a dictionary that cointains one `FailedRows` key. `FailedRows` is a list of tuples where each tuple has two elements: BigQuery table name and the row that didn't match the schema.\r\n\r\nThis can be verified by running the `BigQueryIO deadletter pattern` https://beam.apache.org/documentation/patterns/bigqueryio/\r\n\r\nUsing the template approach I can print the failed rows in a pipeline. When running the job, logger simultaneously prints out the reason why the rows were invalid. \r\n\r\nThe reason (for why the row is invalid) should also be included in the tuple in addition to the BigQuery table and the raw row. This way next pipeline could eg. insert the invalid rows into a different BigQuery table with a schema.\r\n```python\r\nerror_schema = (\r\n    {\r\n        'fields': [\r\n            {'name': 'timestamp', 'type': 'TIMESTAMP', 'mode': 'REQUIRED'},\r\n            {'name': 'table', 'type': 'STRING', 'mode': 'REQUIRED'},\r\n            {'name': 'reason', 'type': 'STRING', 'mode': 'NULLABLE'},\r\n            {'name': 'row_json', 'type': 'STRING', 'mode': 'REQUIRED'},\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe whole pipeline implementation could look something like this\r\n```python\r\nwith beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options) as p:\r\n\r\n    errors = (\r\n        p\r\n        | \"Read from Pub/Sub subscription\" >> beam.io.gcp.pubsub.ReadFromPubSub(\r\n            subscription=known_args.input_subscription,\r\n            timestamp_attribute=None)\r\n        | \"UTF-8 bytes to string\" >> beam.Map(lambda msg: msg.decode(\"utf-8\"))\r\n        | \"Parse JSON messages\" >> beam.Map(json.loads)\r\n        | \"WriteToBigQuery\" >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(\r\n            known_args.output_table,\r\n            schema=schema,\r\n            create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_NEVER,\r\n            write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND,\r\n            ignore_unknown_columns=False,\r\n            insert_retry_strategy=RetryStrategy.RETRY_ON_TRANSIENT_ERROR\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    result = (\r\n        errors[\"FailedRows\"]\r\n        | 'ParseErrors' >> beam.Map(lambda err: {\r\n                \"timestamp\": time.time_ns() / 1000000000,\r\n                \"table\": err[0],\r\n                \"reason\": None, # TODO to be replaced with `err[2]`\r\n                \"row_json\": json.dumps(err[1]),\r\n            })\r\n        | \"WriteErrorsToBigQuery\" >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(\r\n            known_args.output_table + \"_error_records\",\r\n            schema=error_schema,\r\n            create_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.CREATE_IF_NEEDED,\r\n            write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_APPEND,\r\n            ignore_unknown_columns=False,\r\n            insert_retry_strategy=RetryStrategy.RETRY_ON_TRANSIENT_ERROR\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring my reasearch I found a couple of alternate solutions, but they are more complex than they need to be. Thats why I explored the beam source code and found the solution to be an easy and simple change.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
