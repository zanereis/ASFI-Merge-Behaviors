as a followup from conversations in #13216. By making the pass context a global value for both `compile` and `tune` commands, we can ensure the pass context is exactly as the user expected and also test components such as `convert_graph_layout` under a pass context suitable for testing (e.g. add instruments). With this change, it becomes the users responsibility to ensure the PassContext they select is suitable for the passes that will be run. By default, `opt_level` remains as 3 so current workflows that do not alter the pass context from the command line / TVMC Python API should not be

https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/12292\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/13296\r\n\r\nPyTorch uses the same op, `aten::index`, to represent indexing by both integer indices and a boolean mask. In our PT converter, Relay `adv_index` op is used to convert `aten::index`, but it doesn't correctly recognize indexing by mask - it will treat True / False as indices 0 / 1. So our converter generates an invalid model if the PT model uses such indexing, see https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/12292 and https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/13296.\r\n\r\nI fixed this issue by explicitly tuning the mask into integer indices using `argwhere`, which will also take care of the inherent dynamism in indexing by mask.\r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @junrushao @shingjan @yelite

breaks up the Jenkinsfile into ones for GPU, CPU, etc. This removes a false dependency between the build and test steps (e.g. before the GPU tests had to wait on the Hexagon build to complete) and makes the Jenkins UI a bit better since there's not 30 tests to scroll through to find a failure. An example can be found in my fork here: https://github.com/driazati/tvm/pull/38 in the checks box.

when compiling MobileBERT on x86, we get a crash from https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/11d22bdc1bd45d952eb140684e64f01438b7f516/src/tir/transforms/arg_binder.cc#L102-L106.\r\n\r\nThis is caused from the subgraph attached in the test. Since https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11341, `concatenate` is implemented as a TE extern on x86. `te.extern(...)` doesn't explicitly set the `elem_offset` parameter of input / output buffers it creates, which ends up `elem_offset` of these buffers being the default value, 0. This causes a problem from the above check in `BindBuffer`, since the subgraph does create a non-zero `elem_offset` slice from a buffer whose `elem_offset` is set to zero. \r\n\r\nSince we don't require buffers created in `te.extern(...)` to have zero `elem_offset`, we can avoid this problem by explicitly setting `elem_offset` to be a variable there. This fix was found by @Lunderberg and I'm sending this PR on behalf of him. He also suggested making the `strides` parameter an array of `Var` as well, but I didn't do it to keep the change minimal.\r\n\r\ncc @Lunderberg @tkonolige

to the maximum value of FP16 being quite low (65536), it's very common to be unable to express large reductions using it. This occurs most commonly in simple operators like `mean` and `var`, where the sum of elements is used as a divisor. Given that the actual complexity of those operators is quite low, it makes sense to just perform them in fp32 instead of fp16. This PR adds that casting and a few tests that previously would fail in FP16.","created_at":"2022-11-04T00:44:27Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T15:55:07Z","closed_at":"2022-11-07T17:22:07Z","merged_at":"2022-11-07T17:22:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"dd257e478ef88e3e2a2c1df1b36efbfe4347ee5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/8f192e1477b432ddf7b8ae3d548363e1ca7db765","head":{"label":"jwfromm:fp16_mean_var","ref":"fp16_mean_var","sha":"8f192e1477b432ddf7b8ae3d548363e1ca7db765","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm/tvm","description":"Open

PR fixes the bug in MergeConstants pass on striped networks on Ethos-U NPU.\r\n\r\nThe issue was caused by _DivideConstants_ pass which is introducing new mod parameters and changing their order. So ethosu_write parameter in some cases is moved from the end of the list to the middle.\r\nE.g. from:\r\n`[ethos-u_0_i0, p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, ethosu_write]`\r\nTo:\r\n`[ethos-u_0_i0, p1, p2, ethosu_write, placeholder, placeholder, placeholder, placeholder, placeholder, placeholder, placeholder, placeholder]`\r\n\r\nUpdated version of the  _GetArgsToMergeWithoutArgsNotInConstDict_ and _MakeNewConstDict_ methods in passes.cc can now correctly modify const_dict according to the new parameter list.\r\n\r\ncc @leandron

PR adds a rank check for input tensor in type inference of `nn.instance_norm`. I explain the reasons as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, according to the definition of [Instance Normalization](https://paperswithcode.com/method/instance-normalization), it only normalizes the spatial dimensions. Therefore, the input tensor must be of at least rank 3, and otherwise the operator will not produce meaningful results. \r\n\r\nSecond, `nn.instance_norm` with tensor rank less than 2 leads to a problem in the `SimplifyInference` optimization pass. This pass finds the reduced axes before converting the operator to its lower-level computation definition:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f15afd225140e2a501b8b6aa2def0fd94d31bc54/src/relay/transforms/simplify_inference.cc#L149-L152\r\nIf the rank of the input tensor is less than 3, `reduced_axes` is empty. According to `GetRealAxis`, all the dimensions are reduced:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/f15afd225140e2a501b8b6aa2def0fd94d31bc54/include/tvm/topi/reduction.h#L67-L70\r\nThis is problematic because we do not actually want batch and `axis` dimensions to be reduced.  \r\n\r\ncc @masahi

PR Imports `graph_def` to default graph before calling `function_def_to_graph_def()`.\r\n\r\nIt is needed for `function_def_to_graph_def(func, inshape)` which is called inside `from_tensorflow(graph_def)`.\r\n\r\nThe `func` might have a reference(s) by name to another function(s) in the graph_def functions library. Internally `function_def_to_graph_def()` checks if another function is actually a function using [graph._is_function(fname)](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/v2.9.0/tensorflow/python/framework/function_def_to_graph.py#L141)\r\n\r\nWe need to import `graph_def` to the default context / graph before calling `function_def_to_graph_def()`. Otherwise we might face errors such as the following\r\n```\r\n  File \"/Users/pivovaa/miniconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/tensorflow/python/framework/function_def_to_graph.py\", line 258, in function_def_to_graph_def\r\n    raise ValueError(f\"Function {fname} was not found. Please make sure \"\r\nValueError: Function __inference_map_while_Preprocessor_ResizeToRange_cond_true_18925_191476 was not found. Please make sure the FunctionDef `fdef` is correct.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nTested on custom TF2 model compilation. After the fix the compilation works fine. \r\n\r\nThe model has the following functions relationships btw functions in the functions library\r\n```\r\nfunc.signature.name:__inference_map_while_body_18879_191591\r\n\r\n=============== node_def ====================\r\nname: \"map/while/Preprocessor/ResizeToRange/cond\"\r\nop:

working on improving tuning time on quantized models using tensor core. One of the reasons it is slow is that the function below, which is called thousands of times during each evo search initial population sampling, takes more than 50 msec (on my desktop): \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/a4840e7de38c5a2000917f2101f3ec4a374bcd39/src/meta_schedule/search_strategy/evolutionary_search.cc#L506-L517\r\n\r\nThe time it takes can be broken down into the followings:\r\n* `ApplyToTrace`: 35 msec\r\n* `RewriteTensorize`: 7-8 msec\r\n* `VerifyGPUCode`: 7-8 msec\r\n\r\n`RewriteTensorize` is relatively slow because it invokes `sch->Tensorize(...)` which does some heavy lifting. Since it is called thousands of times, it quickly adds up. It is wasteful if the tensorized schedule is rejected by `VerifyGPUCode` immediately after that.\r\n\r\nSince `tensorize` doesn't affect the validity of a sample, we can improve tuning time slightly by running `VerifyGPUCode` first and do `RewriteTensorize` only on valid samples.\r\n\r\n@vinx13 @junrushao @zxybazh

PR adds features to the `python/tvm/meta_schedule/testing/torchbench/run.py`.\r\n\r\n- Integrate with the TVM PyTorch integration to handle boolean tensor and unaligned memory.\r\n- Deduplicate collected tuning tasks to prevent thousands of tasks created by hundreds of subgraphs with similar structure.\r\n- Add option to cast model to float32, which are more stable numerically than float16 and prevents inaccurate result from many models.\r\n- Add option to choose search strategy in MetaSchedule.\r\n- Inspect output error if the actual output doesn't match the expectation. Also save the actual output and expected output for further analysis if needed.\r\n- Save subgraphs and their example input for debug purpose.\r\n- Print MetaSchedule profiling information at the end of execution.\r\n- Detach PyTorch tensor before exporting to dlpack.\r\n- Fix the sys path to avoid conflict with the `benchmarks` package installed by TorchBench dependency.\r\n- Trim all command line args passed in, in order to prevent breaking some TorchBench model that depends on args.\r\n- Empty cuda cache before starting the actual benchmark.\r\n\r\ncc: @junrushao @zxybazh

a long time, I've been unhappy with TVM's TE-based convolution schedules for Arm Cortex-M. They were a lot slower than the state-of-the-art, and had a lot of strange inefficiencies caused by limitations of TE.\r\n\r\nThis pull request rewrites regular and depthwise convolution schedules on Arm Cortex-M, using MetaSchedule and TIR to make them much faster. It took some work and ended up being a big PR (as many of these changes depend on the others), but I'm really happy with the result.\r\n\r\n# High level changes\r\n\r\n- Adds a `qnn` operator strategy to TVM for Arm Cortex-M. With this change, we are able to skip the QNN lowering pass, letting us use Cortex-M specific implementations of `qnn_conv2d`, `add`, and `requantize` that perform much better.\r\n- Performs operator fusion on the (very common) convolution + bias + requantize block for Cortex-M. This lets us write one schedule that performs all three of these steps, which improves performance by letting us compute multiple operator outputs concurrently (which reduces the number of times the data and weights are loaded from memory).\r\n- Adds a TIR/TVMScript schedule for the convolution + bias + requantize block described above. This fixes a longstanding limitation of TE which required us to write convolution outputs to an intermediate buffer and took a lot of time.\r\n- Uses new, highly optimized C/Assembly extern function to actually perform the convolution. I spent a ton of time looking at and verifying the assembly code it gets compiled into is really fast.\r\n- Overhauls the way requantization is done on Cortex-M by adding new `alter_op_layout` functions for `add` and `requantize`. This reduces the amount of memory loaded during each requantization by over **5x** with some snazzy tricks (pre-multiplying the kernel values with the input zero point, skipping the \"shift\" step in our floating point multiplication approximation, fusing the bias with the pre-multiplied zero point).\r\n- Adds a new, end-to-end Corstone300 test that runs the MLPerf Tiny `vww` model using TFLite and ensures our implementation (with all the optimizations above) produces the same outputs. This is done **by layer**, so if there is ever an accuracy issue, we will know exactly which layer is causing the problem.\r\n\r\n## TFLite-ground-truth Corstone300 Test\r\n\r\nFor a while, microTVM has [had Corstone300 tests](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/tests/python/relay/strategy/arm_cpu) which compare our schedules for regular `nn` ops to implementations elsewhere in TVM, to make sure the schedules are written correctly. Despite this, we've had some accuracy issues (see #13364) when running models end-to-end, and we don't really have tools to debug these.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, the existing tests have two key limitations. They:\r\n1. Compare our results only to **other TVM implementations**\r\n2. They run only the base operators (e.g. just the `nn.conv2d`), while leaving out the bias and re-quantize operations (which are normally fused).\r\n\r\nTo fix this, I've added `test_quantized_convolution.py` in this PR. This test runs the convolution layers of the `vww` model from TinyML perf using [TensorFlow's TFLite Interpreter](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/lite/Interpreter), while saving all the intermediate layer outputs.\r\n\r\nThen, one by one each layer is loaded with TVM and Corstone300, and the **full operator** (with fused convolution, bias, ReLU, and requantization) is run and compared to TFLite's result.\r\n\r\n## Quantized operators and fusion\r\n\r\nTFLite Micro, CMSIS-NN, and (AFAIK) all other microcontroller AI platforms write code for \"fused operators\" - e.g. a convolution  combined with a bias addition, ReLU activation, and requantization. This is good for a few reasons - it prevents us from having to store \"intermediate results\", it lets us combine steps from different operators, and it makes parts of the code easier to write.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't possible with TVM until recently, thanks to #12398 which enabled it for Hexagon. I've done the same thing here for Arm. I've also added strategy functions for 2D quantized convolutions on Arm, though (a) only some cases are supported and (b) the `qnn.Legalize` pass must be disabled for these to be used.\r\n\r\n## TVMScript convolution schedules\r\n\r\nFor a while, TE has had a known limitation that makes it impossible to fuse certain operators when they follow `reduce` operations. This meant microTVM would generate code like the following:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nfor (int32_t k_outer = 0; k_outer < 2; ++k_outer) {\r\n  for (int32_t i = 0; i < 48; ++i) {\r\n    for (int32_t j = 0; j < 48; ++j) {\r\n      int32_t cse_var_4 = (j * 8);\r\n      int32_t cse_var_3 = (k_outer * 4);\r\n      // Writes data to a buffer in memory\r\n      convolution_helper_function(\r\n        (&(((int32_t*)depthwise_conv2d)[(((i * 384) + cse_var_4) + cse_var_3)])), \r\n        (&(((int8_t*)padded_data)[(((i * 400) + cse_var_4) + cse_var_3)])), \r\n        (&(T_reshape[(k_outer * 36)])));\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nfor (int32_t ax1_1 = 0; ax1_1 < 48; ++ax1_1) {\r\n  for (int32_t ax2_1 = 0; ax2_1 < 48; ++ax2_1) {\r\n    for (int32_t ax3_1 = 0; ax3_1 < 8; ++ax3_1) {\r\n      int32_t cse_var_5 = (((ax1_1 * 384) + (ax2_1 * 8)) + ax3_1);\r\n      // Then, has to read the data back before doing more operations. Would be way faster\r\n      // to just fuse these loops, but TE won't let us.\r\n      int32_t __1 = ((int32_t)(((((((int64_t)((int32_t*)depthwise_conv2d)[cse_var_5]) + ... \r\n      // The rest is omitted for brevity\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nI previously looked into this limitation, and with the help of Eric L. and others realized it would be really annoying to fix. Instead, our schedule has been replaced with a `T.prim_func`, which lets us do this fusion (and have much more fine-grained control in general). \r\n\r\nI hit a few bugs doing this (e.g. #13330), and the limited docs for TVMScript meant I had to make some guesses about the right way to do things. It's totally possible this code is gross - I'll describe these issues more in a comment below. However, the generated code looks *much* nicer.\r\n\r\n## New optimized C intrinsic for convolutions\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, I wrote [a faster version of microTVM's tensordot kernel](https://github.com/guberti/tvm/pull/2). That got folded into this PR, as that schedule was not usable on its own. I've added a unit test [test_topi_conv2d_tensordot_opts](tests/python/topi/python/test_topi_conv2d_tensordot_opts.py) that goes into more detail about what the schedule does and why it is fast, but here's just a taste.\r\n\r\nOur previous microTVM-specific schedule for regular `conv2d` was not very good, and was _slower_ than just autotuning a generic implementation (for this reason, OctoML used a generic autotuned schedule to submit microTVM results to MLPerf Tiny). However, there are major limitations for how far an autotuning + C code generation approach can go, as GCC only uses the fast intrinsic functions in super narrow cases.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is how microTVM would previously generate the inner loop of a 1x1 4-channel convolution:\r\n```c\r\noutput[oco_1] = 0;\r\nfor (int ic_1 = 0; ic_1 < 4; ++ic_1) {\r\n    output[oco_1] = (output[oco_1] + (((int)tensor[ic_1]) * ((int)((short*)kernel)[((oco_1 * 128) + ic_1)])));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nArm GCC 12.2 (with flags `-mcpu=cortex-m4 -O3`) compiles this into instructions taking 29 cycles per output generated. That's not good, and the previous microTVM schedule was even worse. \r\n\r\nThe new implementation in `tensordot.py` instead gets compiled into just 15 cycles (though there is still work to be done to get this even lower):\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint tensor__y00_x00__y00_x01 = tensor[0];\r\nint tensor__y00_x02__y00_x03 = tensor[1];\r\n\r\nint kernel__y00_x00__y00_x01 = kernel[0];\r\nint kernel__y00_x02__y00_x03 = kernel[1];\r\n\r\nint sum_0 = __builtin_arm_smuad(tensor__y00_x00__y00_x01, kernel__y00_x00__y00_x01);\r\nsum_0 = __builtin_arm_smlad(tensor__y00_x02__y00_x03, kernel__y00_x02__y00_x03, sum_0);\r\nsum_0 = __builtin_arm_smlad(tensor__y00_x04__y00_x05, kernel__y00_x04__y00_x05, sum_0);\r\nsum_0 = __builtin_arm_smlad(tensor__y00_x06__y00_x07, kernel__y00_x06__y00_x07, sum_0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a very simple case, but we also have good support and tests for complex cases. We can work on data where the start pointers aren't word aligned, work on data where one or more of the data, kernel, or output has width not divisible by the SIMD width, have multiple sums running concurrently to reduce the number of memory loads (e.g. for 3x3 depthwise convolutions). The [unit test](tests/python/topi/python/test_topi_conv2d_tensordot_opts.py) checks all these capabilities, and the `tensordot.py` file itself has comments explaining why doing it this way is faster.\r\n\r\n## Faster re-quantization algorithm!\r\n\r\nThe way microTVM handled convolutions before was terrible. Here is an actual implementation from our MLPerf Tiny submission, which I've modified slightly for readability.\r\n\r\n```c\r\nstatic const int32_t fused_nn_conv2d_constant_1[8] = {\r\n    +0x00000f80, -0x00000180, +0x00007e80, +0x00002880, +0x00010680, -0x00000980, +0x00001380, +0x0000a900\r\n};\r\n\r\nstatic const int32_t fused_nn_conv2d_subtract_constant_2[8] = {\r\n    +0x0000306e, +0x00003092, +0x00008470, +0x00004a13, +0x0000c411, +0x00012da6, +0x00003b70, +0x00015bd8\r\n};\r\n\r\nstatic const int64_t fused_nn_conv2d_subtract_add_cast_constant_3[8] = {\r\n    +0x000000004648e699LL, +0x0000000063c512d1LL, +0x00000000611b0293LL, +0x000000007524d8c7LL, +0x000000007758617fLL, +0x00000000590a119bLL, +0x00000000500f9336LL, +0x0000000040ee5089LL\r\n};\r\n\r\nstatic const int64_t fused_nn_conv2d_subtract_add_cast_multiply_constant_4[8] = {\r\n    +0x0000002000000000LL, +0x0000004000000000LL, +0x0000004000000000LL, +0x0000004000000000LL, +0x0000008000000000LL, +0x0000010000000000LL, +0x0000004000000000LL, +0x0000008000000000LL\r\n};\r\nstatic const int64_t fused_nn_conv2d_subtract_add_cast_multiply_add_constant_5[8] = {\r\n    +0x0000000000000026LL, +0x0000000000000027LL, +0x0000000000000027LL, +0x0000000000000027LL, +0x0000000000000028LL, +0x0000000000000029LL, +0x0000000000000027LL, +0x0000000000000028LL\r\n};\r\n\r\nvoid requantize(void* compute, int32_t conv[8], int32_t i0_i1_outer_fused, int32_t i2_outer, int32_t i3_outer) {\r\n  // Reorganized by @guberti for readability\r\n  int64_t _0 = ((int64_t)conv[i3_outer]) + ((int64_t)(fused_nn_conv2d_subtract_constant_2)[i3_outer]);\r\n  int64_t _1 = _0 - ((int64_t)(fused_nn_conv2d_constant_1)[i3_outer]);\r\n  int64_t _2 = _1 * fused_nn_conv2d_subtract_add_cast_constant_3[i3_outer];\r\n  int64_t _3 = _2 + fused_nn_conv2d_subtract_add_cast_multiply_constant_4[i3_outer];\r\n  int64_t _4 = _3 >> fused_nn_conv2d_subtract_add_cast_multiply_add_constant_5[i3_outer];\r\n  int32_t __1 = ((int32_t) (_4)) - 128;\r\n\r\n  // Code below is untouched\r\n  int32_t __2 = (__1) < (127) ?

(__5) : (__6));\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a bunch of things about this that aren't ideal:\r\n- We have **FIVE** re-quantization constants (not counting the zero point, which is correctly inlined).\r\n- 3/5 of the constants are `int64` values, and they are all padded with unnecessary zeros. This means we need to load eight words from memory for each re-quantization operation.\r\n- The first five math operations are `int64` ops, which are slow because Arm Cortex-M is a 32-bit platform.\r\n- `int8` bounds checking is done with a wacky set of ternary operators. I checked - these do not get complied down nicely.\r\n\r\nI've fixed all these things using QNN `alter_op_layout` functions, and I've implemented a few more complex optimizations:\r\n- When applicable, we now replace the `bias` by `bias + sum(kernel) * input_zero_point` (e.g. pre-multiplying the kernel values by the input zero point). This prevents us from having to subtract out the bias every time we do a multiplication by a kernel value (note that the input zero point is `-128` basically every time, because Cortex-M does not have a `uint x int` instruction). The result is stored in an `int32` value.\r\n- We force bitshifts to be >=33 (which in practice they always are), which allows us to only use the top `32` bits from our `int32 x int32` multiplication. This lets us use **zero** `int64` memory loads or instructions, without sacrificing accuracy.\r\n\r\nTogether, this means our requantization code now looks like this:\r\n```c\r\nstatic const int32_t REQUANTIZE_SCALE[8] = {\r\n    +0x067bed1c, +0x05c578b9, +0x03d08ea5, +0x01ed066f, \r\n    +0x0176b86f, +0x027f3977, +0x054e3783, +0x06d0a442, \r\n};\r\n\r\nstatic const int32_t BIAS[16] = {\r\n    +0x00006b58, -0x000023aa, +0x00005cf3, +0x00004cc6, \r\n    +0x0000605e, +0x00006eed, +0x0000512e, -0x00002526, \r\n};\r\n// Some lines omitted for brevity\r\n\r\n// Bias is added before convolution, as doing it this way is faster\r\nint requant_0 = (sum_0 * (long long) REQUANTIZE_SCALE[j]) >> 32;\r\nrequant_0 = (requant_0 + 1) >> 1;\r\nrequant_0 = __builtin_arm_ssat(requant_0 - 128, 8);\r\n((short*) output)[0] = (short) requant_0;\r\n```\r\nAll in all, requantization now takes ~8x fewer cycles per output than it did before.","created_at":"2022-10-31T18:23:35Z","updated_at":"2023-06-22T08:39:01Z","closed_at":"2022-12-06T16:27:58Z","merged_at":"2022-12-06T16:27:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"bbba8d97fe9c32513f6143b54ea66ce8277b79d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13242/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13242/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13242/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e5e37cdf578be63c7d2b8004f3bb83c3b29a38bf","head":{"label":"guberti:arm-qnn-convolution","ref":"arm-qnn-convolution","sha":"e5e37cdf578be63c7d2b8004f3bb83c3b29a38bf","user":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":371518634,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzE1MTg2MzQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"guberti/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guberti","id":3069006,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjkwMDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3069006?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti","html_url":"https://github.com/guberti","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guberti/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guberti/tvm","description":"Open

PR enables simplification and folding of a sub graph containing adjacent `mul`s and `add`s with constant inputs.\r\n### Motivation\r\nWorkloads like [densenet-121](https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/main/vision/classification/densenet-121/model/densenet-7.onnx) has several partitions with `conv-bn-mul-add-relu` pattern, for example:\r\n``` go\r\ndef @main(%data_0: Tensor[(1, 3, 224, 224), float32] /* ty=Tensor[(1, 3, 224, 224), float32] */) -> Tensor[(1, 1000, 1, 1), float32] {\r\n  %0 = nn.conv2d(%data_0, meta[relay.Constant][0] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 3, 7, 7), float32] */, strides=[2, 2], padding=[3, 3, 3, 3], channels=64, kernel_size=[7, 7]) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 64, 112, 112), float32] */;\r\n  %1 = nn.batch_norm(%0, meta[relay.Constant][1] /* ty=Tensor[(64), float32] */, meta[relay.Constant][2] /* ty=Tensor[(64), float32] */, meta[relay.Constant][3] /* ty=Tensor[(64), float32] */, meta[relay.Constant][4] /* ty=Tensor[(64), float32] */) /* ty=(Tensor[(1, 64, 112, 112), float32], Tensor[(64), float32], Tensor[(64), float32]) */;\r\n  %2 = %1.0 /* ty=Tensor[(1, 64, 112, 112), float32] */;\r\n  %3 = multiply(%2, meta[relay.Constant][5] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 1, 1), float32] */) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 64, 112, 112), float32] */;\r\n  %4 = add(%3, meta[relay.Constant][6] /* ty=Tensor[(64, 1, 1), float32] */) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 64, 112, 112), float32] */;\r\n  %5 = nn.relu(%4) /* ty=Tensor[(1, 64, 112, 112), float32] */;\r\n  // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCurrent transforms on this pattern are:\r\n1. `conv-bn-mul-add-relu` as the original pattern.\r\n2. to `conv-mul-add-mul-add-relu` as `bn` is expended to `mul-add`. \r\n3. to `conv-add-mul-add-relu` as the first `mul` is folded into `conv`.\r\n\r\nAs all the `mul`s and `add`s have constant second inputs, they should be folded to a single `mul-add` and a preferred transform sequence should be:\r\n\r\n1. `conv-bn-mul-add-relu` as the original pattern.\r\n2. to `conv-mul-add-mul-add-relu` as `bn` is expended to `mul-add`. \r\n3. to `conv-mul-add-relu` as `mul`s and `add`s are folded to one single `mul-add`.\r\n4. to `conv-add-relu` as `mul` is folded into `conv`.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nActually, any series contain `mul`s and `add`s with constant inputs could be folded to one particular `mul-add`. Three rewrite rules are added to make this happen:\r\n\r\n1. `mul-mul` -> `mul`\r\n2. `add-add` -> `add`\r\n3. `add-mul` -> `mul-add`\r\n\r\nAs `SimplifyExpr` apply simplifications iteratively until no changes to the graph, any `mul` and `add` series could be rewritten to one single `mul`, `add` or `mul-add` with one of the binary inputs could evaluates to a constant in the following `FoldConstant` pass.","created_at":"2022-10-27T08:05:25Z","updated_at":"2022-10-29T06:05:37Z","closed_at":"2022-10-29T06:05:34Z","merged_at":"2022-10-29T06:05:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"e971956d760aa92cbae1fa4030f46c1046eaa87a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13213/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13213/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13213/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/14d8bbae8264edfa44142b646ed6afc561dc9cf1","head":{"label":"yangulei:upstream_muladd","ref":"upstream_muladd","sha":"14d8bbae8264edfa44142b646ed6afc561dc9cf1","user":{"login":"yangulei","id":24203353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjAzMzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24203353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei","html_url":"https://github.com/yangulei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":425653971,"node_id":"R_kgDOGV720w","name":"tvm","full_name":"yangulei/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yangulei","id":24203353,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjAzMzUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24203353?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei","html_url":"https://github.com/yangulei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangulei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yangulei/tvm","description":"Open

Most diffs are from test cases, which are bloated due to many TVMScript modules.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the notion of \"module equality\" introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13050, I'm adding a new variant of module equality based on the \"anchor blocks\". I defined the anchor block in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13194. \r\n\r\nCurrently, MS does tuning at the level of subgraphs. So for example in resnet where there are `conv2d -> add -> relu` and `conv2d -> add -> add -> relu` subgraphs, the two subgraphs are treated as distinct tuning tasks even if the anchor block conv2d workloads are identical. The new module equality will identify them as equal, so it reduces the number of tuning tasks if shorter tuning time is preferred over subgraph-level performance. Currently there is no dedicated API for anchor-block tuning - passing `module_equality=\"anchor-block\"` to task extraction and `tune_relay` will enable it. \r\n\r\nThis is particularly effective for int8 models, since each conv2d / dense (anchor) op is quantized slightly differently, ending up many similar but not identical elemwise ops fused after the anchor blocks. On the int8 resnet50 model I tested, it reduced the number of conv2d tuning tasks from 36 to 23.   \r\n\r\nThe interesting question is the performance difference between full subgraph-level tuning and anchor-block tuning. To experiment this, I tested the int8 resnet50 mentioned above, where anchor-based tuning makes the most difference in terms of the # of extracted tasks. The results are summarized below. \r\n\r\n`num_iter_per_task = 32`, and `max_iters_per_task = 128` in all cases.\r\n| Target | Anchor tuning | Subgraph tuning |\r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| x86 VNNI | 4.45 | 4.58 |\r\n| Hexagon | 58.4 | 58.1 |\r\n|CUDA tensor core (batch size 16) | 6.0 | 6.7 (TODO: Try again)|\r\n\r\nFrom the model + target combinations I tested, I didn't see much perf difference beyond those from natural tuning flaky-ness. The tensorcore result is a bit weird and needs more investigation, but I found that tuning this model using int8 tensor core auto tensorization is incredibly slow currently (for example, getting the 6.7 result took 12 hours). There is also the correctness issue discussed in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/13204. So I haven't done more experiments on tensorcore.\r\n\r\n### Applying the trace tuned on an anchor block to the target block \r\nThe tricky problem that this work address is the application of a trace, which is tuned on a \"representative\" anchor subgraph, to the target mod which has different post blocks. Note that, in the resnet example where there are `conv2d -> add -> relu` and `conv2d -> add -> add -> relu` subgraphs, we tune the \"smaller\" `conv2d -> add -> relu` subgraph, not just the pure anchor block `conv2d`. \r\n\r\nSo while applying a trace tuned on just `conv2d` to `conv2d -> add` would be trivial (the existing `Trace::ApplyToSchedule` would just work), in practice we would be applying a trace tuned on `conv2d -> add` to `conv2d -> subtract`, for example. My proposed solution is implemented in `src/meta_schedule/trace_apply.cc` and it is tested extensively in `test_meta_schedule_trace_apply.py`.\r\n\r\n@junrushao @zxybazh @vinx13 @tkonolige

PR fixes a bug of affine-binding check in TIR. Previously, the affine-binding check will call `DetectIterMap` with trivial iterators simplified. However, this will cause some blocks with affine bindings not recognized as having affine bindings (see the regression test for a concrete example). This PR specifies that we do not simplify the trivial iterators when checking affine bindings.\r\n\r\ncc @spectrometerHBH @vinx13 @junrushao @wrongtest-intellif
