was renamed since it now returns a new type, `JobServiceHandle`.  This PR changes that method back to its original name, so that it does not break in scenarios like the test which do not care about the return type.  It also adds a docstring and improves some variable names to add additional clarity. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this [doc](https://s.apache.org/splittable-do-fn) and [blog](https://beam.apache.org/blog/2017/08/16/splittable-do-fn.html) for some context about SplittableDoFns.\r\n\r\nTo support watermark reporting within the Java SDK for SplittableDoFns, we need a way to have SDF authors to report watermark estimates over the element and restriction pair that they are processing.\r\n\r\nFor UnboundedSources, it was found to be a pain point to ask each SDF author to write their own watermark estimation which typically prevented re-use. Therefore we would like to have a \"library\" of watermark estimators that help SDF authors perform this estimation similar to how there is a \"library\" of restrictions and restriction trackers that SDF authors can use. For SDF authors where the existing library doesn't work, they can add additional ones that observe timestamps of elements or choose to directly report the watermark through a \"ManualWatermarkEstimator\" parameter that can be supplied to @ProcessElement methods.\r\n\r\nThe public facing portion of the DoFn changes adds three new annotations for new DoFn style methods:GetInitialWatermarkEstimatorState: Returns the initial watermark state, similar to GetInitialRestrictionGetWatermarkEstimatorStateCoder: Returns a coder compatible with watermark state type, similar to GetRestrictionCoder for restrictions returned by GetInitialRestriction.NewWatermarkEstimator: Returns a watermark estimator that either the framework invokes allowing it to observe the timestamps of output records or a manual watermark estimator that can be explicitly invoked to update the watermark.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the public facing additions to the core Java API.\r\n\r\nThis mirrors a bunch of work that was done by Boyuan within the Pyhon SDK [[pr/9794](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/9794), [pr/10375](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/10375)] but in the style of new DoFn parameter/method invocation we have in the Java SDK.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This change\r\nallows specifying the number of main inputs, while also preserving\r\nthe existing code path of not specifying it.

PR modifies `WriteToBigQuery` to be able to do file loads via Avro format. Using Avro allows bypassing some limitations of newline-delimited JSON loads, including the ability to support NaN and Inf float values.\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n* Add a `temp_file_format` option to `WriteToBigQuery` and `BigQueryBatchFileLoads` to select which file format to use for loading data.\r\n* Move implementation of `get_table_schema_from_string`, `table_schema_to_dict`, and `get_dict_table_schema` to `bigquery_tools` module.\r\n* Add `bigquery_avro_tools` module with utilities for converting BigQuery `TableSchema` to Avro `RecordSchema` (this is a port of what's available in the Java SDK, with modified behavior for logical types).\r\n* Modify `WriteRecordsToFile` and `WriteGroupedRecordsToFile` to accept schema and file format, since in order to be read by BigQuery, the Avro files must have schema headers.\r\n* Parameterize relevant tests to check both JSON and Avro code paths.\r\n* Add integration test using Avro-based file loads.\r\n* Introduce `JsonRowWriter` and `AvroRowWriter` classes which implement the `io.IOBase` interface and are used by `WriteRecordsToFile` and `WriteGroupedRecordsToFile`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`withAvroSchemaValues()` to read `PCollection<GenericRecord>` from Kafka topics where values are serialised by Avro schemas . Also, it sets Beam schema inferred on Avro schema used for values serialisation, so, it can be used as an input for `SqlTransform` downstream of pipeline. It has to be used with `ConfluentSchemaRegistryDeserializerProvider`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR refers to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-9247: [Python] PTransform that integrates Cloud Vision functionality.\r\n\r\nSmall comments:\r\nThe synchronous annotation is very similar to the videointelligence implementation.\r\n\r\nI opted to only support async (offline) batch annotation:\r\n* Synchronous batch annotation only supports batching <=5 elements at a time, so is not very useful (https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/batch).\r\n* Synchronous batch annotation also doesn't make a lot of sense for Beam, as the CPU/workers would just sit around and wait until a response is received from the Vision API, which seems inefficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n~~I'm still working on a few kinks and issues with the batch annotation as well as making sure all tests run properly, so consider this a draft PR for now.~~ PR is now finalised.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

add a meaningful description for your change here_\r\n\r\nI am submitting the finalized files for the Apache Beam communication strategy that we have been discussing [over email](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@beam.apache.org:lte=1M:communication%20strategy), so that they can be incorporated to the repository for anyone to use and reference. All files are in the folder /channels and communication strategy. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the communication strategy is to grow Apache Beam projects by driving more new users, and accelerating the conversion of users to contributors. It outlines 3 specific proposals for implementation.  \r\n\r\nI'm requesting the following reviewers, based on who gave feedback on the mailing list:\r\n- @tweise \r\n- @pabloem \r\n- @kennknowles \r\n- @matthiasa4 \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adds PCollection metrics to the Go SDK, in particular, Element Count, and Sampled Size.\r\n\r\nNew exec.PCollection nodes are added between every processing node in the bundle execution graph.\r\n* The new metrics are only added as MonitoringInfos, not the legacy protos.\r\n* There's about ~10ns added per element per PCollection node due to the atomic additions for every element.\r\n* Elements for sizes are selected randomly, then encoded to count their bytes (w/o window headers).\r\n  * An initial index is selected form the first [0,1,2] at bundle start up, and then pre-select the next index from somewhere later on, proportional to the bundle so far.\r\n  * As currently set up, it will take around 200-300 samples for the first 1M elements, so encoded overhead is limited\r\n* PCollections from a DataSource do 100% \"sampling\", since they're reading the bytes directly anyway. The PCollection node that would have been added after the DataSource is elided from the graph during construction, but re-used to avoid duplicating the logic for concurrently manipulating the size distribution.\r\n  * DataSources can properly handle CoGBKs as well, counting non-header bytes for iterables, and state backed iterables.\r\n  * This still involves a mutex Lock for every update, so we may want to find a lighter weight mechanism to handle the distribution samples from DataSources, or simply opt for the same random sampling.\r\n  * A similar method could be used for DataSinks as well, but not handled in this PR. \r\n  * It's important to note that the runner is already aware of the number of bytes sent and received from the SDK side, so we may opt to remove that this entirely.\r\n* Counts and Samples are yet not made for SideInputs, which would better account for data consumed by DoFns.\r\n\r\nThank you @ajamato for reminding me of the pre-select method for sampling, and @lukecwik for pointing out the DataSource can avoid separate additional encoding costs when measuring elements.\r\n\r\nPerformance impact:\r\nI have two jobs I use for benchmarking this: Pipeline A uses int64s as elements and does simple passthroughs and sums, and Pipeline B where it's using large protocol buffers as elements, which spends a fair amount of CPU time decoding them.\r\n\r\nFor small \"fast\" elements, the overhead is about ~19.5% of the Go side processing (which makes sense if elements are just being passed around or incremented).\r\nFor large \"heavy\" elements, the overhead is about ~0.125% of the Go side of processing.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this is only taking into account the Go SDK worker, and not any runner side costs. This feels acceptable for the time being, though it's possible we can improve this later, especially for \"lighter\" jobs.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Ie83fefc63ee03c917028b994dd2f2487f06e8109\r\n\r\nThe fix for BEAM-1833 broke some people, so I am setting the experiment to be disabled by default. For the InteractiveRunner we enable it by default. Since the runner ordinarily doesn't have access to the PipelineOptions we set the experiment through the apply() method. This is so that users won't have to set the experiment manually.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
