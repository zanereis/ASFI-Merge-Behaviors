This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect\">github connect</a> or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.7</h2>\n<p>Support 10GB cache upload using the latest version <code>1.0.8</code> of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache\"><code>@actions/cache</code> </a></p>\n<h2>v2.1.6</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Catch unhandled &quot;bad file descriptor&quot; errors that sometimes occurs when the cache server returns non-successful response (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/pull/596\">actions/cache#596</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix permissions error seen when extracting caches with GNU tar that were previously created using BSD tar (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/527\">actions/cache#527</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make caching more verbose <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/650\">#650</a></li>\n<li>Use GNU tar on macOS if available <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/701\">#701</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrades <code>@actions/core</code> to v1.2.6 for <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfwh-5m23-j46w\">CVE-2020-15228</a>. This action was not using the affected methods.</li>\n<li>Fix error handling in <code>uploadChunk</code> where 400-level errors were not being detected and handled correctly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds input to limit the chunk upload size, useful for self-hosted runners with slower upload speeds</li>\n<li>No-op when executing on GHES</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>@actions/cache</code> package to <code>v1.0.2</code> which allows cache action to use posix format when taring files.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Replaces the <code>http-client</code> with the Azure Storage SDK for NodeJS when downloading cache content from Azure.  This should help improve download performance and reliability as the SDK downloads files in 4 MB chunks, which can be parallelized and retried independently</li>\n<li>Display download progress and speed</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/cache/blob/main/RELEASES.md\">actions/cache's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>Releases</h1>\n<h3>3.0.0</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated minimum runner version support from node 12 -&gt; node 16</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.0.1</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for caching from GHES 3.5.</li>\n<li>Fixed download issue for files &gt; 2GB during restore.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.0.2</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for dynamic cache size cap on GHES.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3.0.3</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed avoiding empty cache save when no files are available for caching.

pull request solves few errors I spotted while trying to use plc4j modbus stuff.\r\nFirst of all, it adds support for String outputs from modbus requests, so `holding:3000:STRING[30]` will bring back up to 15 character text which wasn't covered properly by codegen till now. It works with `vstring` stuff Ben added a while ago.\r\nThen there is second part which is actual modbus plus stuff. I provided sample request/responses I acquired from inverter, so its possible to see actual packets and payload mapping. For now I did stick with structs as identification answer is nested structure with variable list of elements.\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-19T22:55:37Z","updated_at":"2024-12-24T00:16:06Z","closed_at":"2024-12-24T00:16:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hutcheb","id":15604556,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NjA0NTU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15604556?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb","html_url":"https://github.com/hutcheb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hutcheb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4018727790,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBtifa87viOtu","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/plc4x/labels/java","name":"java","color":"ffa221","default":false,"description":"Pull

shutdown behavior of a polling thread. The wrong time unit was used causing executor shutdown to take way more time than expected in cases where it's stuck. Thanks to Claus Näveke for spotting this and for the initial PR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug in which condition was not evaluated correctly with small intervals, such as:\nawait().atMost(Duration.ofMillis(10)).pollInterval(Duration.ofMillis(5)).until(..);\n(issue 224). Thanks to Robby Decosemaeker for PR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded the awaitility-kotlin module to use kotlin 1.6.10</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fail fast conditions can now be specified with assertions. For example:</p>\n<p>await().failFast(() -&gt; assertThat(state).isNotEqualTo(&quot;Failed&quot;)).until(..);</p>\n<p>(issue 238)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/b5d82b703caa88b2ddc2ae0d06020c286d023a79\"><code>b5d82b7</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release awaitility-4.2.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/1ae03495d5a76298ae03f64b1209bc63f049d6b6\"><code>1ae0349</code></a> Preparing changelog for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/386eccb7369b6bdb0e434980a0c39ec7c70405a9\"><code>386eccb</code></a> Improve error message in test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/fc45eb743e7f3a2aec2d57f6d3efd11165c9de44\"><code>fc45eb7</code></a> Fail fast conditions can now be specified with assertions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/d39c00d76af752cfede573453aa904c761c5f6f6\"><code>d39c00d</code></a> Upgrading Kotlin to 1.6.10</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/f359e945794f1c2fc99c6a2cb1b7ac8638394cb8\"><code>f359e94</code></a> Formatted ConditionAwaiter</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/9c9a79bbb8c4a9c1cf5b8822a310e3b9161d07a4\"><code>9c9a79b</code></a> Updated changelog to reflect the latest changes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/9e40d37614fae55588b7d512a447f76804f3e312\"><code>9e40d37</code></a> Fix <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/awaitility/awaitility/issues/224\">#224</a> - handle immidiate success scenario (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/awaitility/awaitility/issues/228\">#228</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/3c9f3450ca3bcf7dd53f8fcf2f7c06675350d9cc\"><code>3c9f345</code></a> Fixed a bug in the shutdown behavior of a polling thread.

the <code>Throwables</code> methods <code>lazyStackTrace</code> and <code>lazyStackTraceIsLazy</code>. They are no longer useful on any current platform. (6ebd7d8648)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Added a new method <code>ImmutableMap.Builder.buildKeepingLast()</code>, which keeps the last value for any given key rather than throwing an exception when a key appears more than once. (68500b2c09)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: As a side-effect of the <code>buildKeepingLast()</code> change, the idiom <code>ImmutableList.copyOf(Maps.transformValues(map, function))</code> may produce different results if <code>function</code> has side-effects. (This is not recommended.) (68500b2c09)</li>\n<li><code>hash</code>: Added <code>Hashing.fingerprint2011()</code>. (13f703c25f)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Changed <code>ByteStreams.nullOutputStream()</code> to follow the contract of <code>OutputStream.write</code> by throwing an exception if the range of bytes is out of bounds. (1cd85d01c9)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>@CheckReturnValue</code> to the package (with a few exceptions). (a0e2577de6)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Added <code>HttpHeaders</code> constant for <code>Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network</code>. (6dabbdf9c9)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Added accumulate/update methods for <code>AtomicDouble</code> and <code>AtomicDoubleArray</code>. (2d875d327a)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>APIs promoted from <code>@Beta</code></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>base</code>: <code>Throwables</code> methods <code>getCausalChain</code> and <code>getCauseAs</code> (dd462afa6b)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: <code>Streams</code> methods <code>mapWithIndex</code> and <code>findLast</code> (8079a29463)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: the remaining methods in <code>Comparators</code>: <code>min</code>, <code>max</code>, <code>lexicographical</code>, <code>emptiesFirst</code>, <code>emptiesLast</code>, <code>isInOrder</code>, <code>isInStrictOrder</code> (a3e411c3a4)</li>\n<li><code>escape</code>: various APIs (468c68a6ac)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
