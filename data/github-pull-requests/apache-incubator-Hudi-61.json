*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nPrometheus [Pushgateway](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/) never forgets series pushed to it and will expose them to Prometheus forever unless those series are manually deleted via the Pushgateway's API. When deltastreamer finds that there are no new records to be read from the source since the last checkpoint it doesn't emit a metric because the write path is not triggered and leads to a graph like below in case of PushGateway metrics reporter. For other metrics reporter it would be a null value and no data will be shown in the graph.\r\n\r\n`22/02/07 11:23:10 INFO DeltaSync: No new data, source checkpoint has not changed. Nothing to commit. Old checkpoint=(Option{val=20220207062847034}). New Checkpoint=(20220207062847034)`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16958856/152838666-da7e30b0-0cfb-4e19-97e5-131220cc60e5.png)\r\n\r\nTo give a better representation of the actual metrics for Prometheus PushGateway, the counter metrics have to be updated with zero value so that it's better than having stale data which was ingested as part of the last checkpoint.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16958856/152838714-39576af8-622b-4208-8981-414451c34028.png)\r\n\r\nThis is an issue only w/ continuous mode. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nPrometheus [Pushgateway](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/) never forgets series pushed to it and will expose them to Prometheus forever unless those series are manually deleted via the Pushgateway's API. When deltastreamer finds that there are no new records to be read from the source since the last checkpoint it doesn't emit a metric because the write path is not triggered and leads to a graph like below in case of PushGateway metrics reporter. For other metrics reporter it would be a null value and no data will be shown in the graph.\r\n\r\n`22/02/07 11:23:10 INFO DeltaSync: No new data, source checkpoint has not changed. Nothing to commit. Old checkpoint=(Option{val=20220207062847034}). New Checkpoint=(20220207062847034)\r\n`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16958856/152831831-7c4baab1-8b01-4100-8b64-40ec702e9749.png)\r\n\r\nTo give a better representation of the actual metrics for Prometheus PushGateway, the counter metrics have to be updated with zero value so that it's better than having stale data which was ingested as part of the last checkpoint.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen begin instantime for incremental pull is missing from source hudi table's timeline (due to archival), we support two strategies. read from latest and read upto latest. Read from latest is an incremental pull just with latest commit. Read upto latest is a snapshot query since the puller do not know what exactly to pull. There was some bug in this flow (read upto latest) and have fixed it. \r\n\r\nFor eg, lets say source hudi table has the following timeline\r\nC1, C2... C10. \r\ncommits until C4 are archived. \r\n\r\nWhen the puller sets read upto latest with following begin timestamp:\r\nOption.empty()\r\nOr\r\nC1\r\nOr \r\nC2\r\nOr \r\nC3\r\n\r\nAll of the above will result in snapshot query (or full table scan) with the fix in this patch. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe files recorded in the commit do not match the actual ones. When the memory cache is invalid , Spark retroactively recalculates. For example one of the executors is lost causing memory cache invalid.\r\n\r\nAlso it is easy to re-produce\r\nStep 1 : remove `compactor.maybePersist(statuses, config);` in `RunCompactionActionExecutor `to simulate cache invalidation and build a new hudi jars\r\nStep 2: run a normal compaction\r\nStep 3: compare the files record in commit file and actual ones in partition.\r\n\r\n**This may cause Files in metadata table are not the same as direct listing.**\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

converts `Timestamp` to TIMESTAMP_MICROS format when upsert and other operations, except `bulk_insert`.\r\n\r\nAnd `bulk_insert` enables `hoodie.datasource.write.row.writer.enable`, and use `HoodieRowParquetWriteSupport` to write datas. \r\n\r\nFor the issue #4552 , that will cause problems by default.

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWhen metadata table is created and when it decides to the initialization\r\nfrom the filesystem for the user dataset, all the enabled partitions

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAs of now all metrics created by hudi has table name prefixed by default. This pr aims to put that behavior behind a configuration and allows the user to disable it.\r\n\r\nFor example lets say we have 2 hudi tables `customers` and `loan_accounts`. Right now the metrics in prometheus will come like this\r\n```\r\ncustomers_TimelineService_TOTAL_HANDLE_TIME{job=\"customers\"} 589\r\nloan_accounts_TimelineService_TOTAL_HANDLE_TIME{job=\"loan_accounts\"} 642\r\n```\r\nIts conventional in prometheus to have consistent metric name with differences in labels. After the changes in this pr, metrics will come like this which is much simpler to plot across lets say 100s of hudi tables with each having 100s of metrics.\r\n\r\n```\r\nTimelineService_TOTAL_HANDLE_TIME{job=\"customers\"} 589\r\nTimelineService_TOTAL_HANDLE_TIME{job=\"loan_accounts\"} 642\r\n```\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nAdded configuration `hoodie.metrics.common_prefix.enable`\r\nThis configuration is true by default and which doesnt change any behavior for existing users.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end.*\r\n  - *Added HoodieClientWriteTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes,

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis change makes sure MT records are updated appropriately on HDFS: previously after Log File append operations MT records were updated w/ just the size of the deltas being appended to the original files, which have been found to be the cause of issues in case of Rollbacks that were instead updating MT with records bearing the full file-size.\r\n\r\nTo make sure that we hedge against similar issues going f/w, this PR alleviates this discrepancy and streamlines the flow of MT table always ingesting records bearing full file-sizes.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Refactored MT records composition from HoodieCommitMetadata to always operate on full file-sizes\r\n - Fixed HoodieMetadataPayload to properly combine file-sizes\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title &

case\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n Add a customized payload `PartialOverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload` to support partial overwrite records fields.\r\nFor example, two incoming record batch A(1, null, 1, 1) and B(2, 2, null, 2) will be combined as the result (2, 2, 1, 2)\r\n*(For example: This pull request adds quick-start document.)*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Add a `PartialOverwriteWithLatestAvroPayload` to support partial overwrite records*\r\n  - *Add a config `partial.overwrite.enabled` to control if enable partial overwrite*\r\n  - *Change the ValueState of `BucketAssignFunction` from `HoodieRecordGlobalLocation` to `HoodieRecord`*\r\n  - Support partition path changed case\r\n    - Merge `HoodieRecord` before storing the record in ValueSate\r\n    - Copy and sink a new record from state to downstream operator while the record partition is changed\r\n  - Add `compareTo` to compare two HoodieRecords to chose their sequence, because cannot get the sequence from `#preCombine` method if merge two records in `#preCombine` method\r\n  - Add `schema` filed(String) in new AvroPayload, which will be used to `#preCombine` two records\r\n  - Change `BootstrapOperator` to load `HoodieRecord` with data instead of only HoddieKey\r\n  - Change `RowDataToHoodieFunction` to create payload with schema \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n  - *Added PartialOverwriteWithLatestAvroPayloadTest to verify the change.*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a job locally with both `preCombine` and `combineAndGetUpdateValue` methods*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-31T12:06:03Z","updated_at":"2023-02-10T06:18:54Z","closed_at":"2023-02-10T06:18:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65ecd98040ce485bd8f96fcf706bf42e588fd90f","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis change is addressing issues in regards to Metadata Table observing ingesting duplicated records leading to it persisting incorrect file-sizes for the files referred to in those records.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple issues that were leading to that: \r\n\r\n1. [HUDI-3322] Incorrect Rollback Plan generation: Rollback Plan generated for MOR tables was overly expansively listing all log-files with the latest base-instant as the ones that have been affected by the rollback, leading to invalid MT records being ingested referring to those.\r\n2. [HUDI-3343] Metadata Table including Uncommitted Log Files during Bootstrap: Since MT is bootstrapped at the end of the commit operation execution (after FS activity, but before committing to the timeline), it was actually incorrectly ingesting some files that were part of the intermediate state of the operation being committed.\r\n\r\nThis change will unblock Stack of PRs based off #4556\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Cleaned up Rollback request generation flow\r\n - Cleaned up superfluous `writtenLogFilesSize` payload \r\n - Fixed RollbackUtils to always leverage appropriate instant when fetching metadata\r\n - Propagate `HoodieWriteStat` w/in `ListingBasedRollbackRequest`\r\n - Fixed RollbackPlan generation to properly refeference files bearing blocks\r\n - Fixed superfluous `RollbackPlan` generation\r\n - Fixing MT to be bootstapped _before_ carrying out any FS operations, to make sure it's not ingesting intermediate step upon bootstrapping\r\n - Fix MarkerBasedRollbackStrategy to only ref the latest log-file as the one blocks have been appended to\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixing following tests that started to fail after changes in #4556:\r\n\r\n`TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableRollback#testMORTableRestore`\r\n`TestHoodieSparkMergeOnReadTableRollback#testRollbackWithDeltaAndCompactionCommit`\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open

JIRA.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-29T01:22:25Z","updated_at":"2022-02-02T21:10:52Z","closed_at":"2022-02-02T21:10:52Z","merged_at":"2022-02-02T21:10:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"819e8018ff926fea21c95e75ae1b7991afb227c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently, HadoopFsRelation will use the value of  the real partition path as the value of the partition field. However, different from the normal table, Hudi will persist the partition value in the parquet file. And in some cases, it's different between the value of the real partition path and the value of the partition field. \r\nSo here implement `BaseFileOnlyViewRelation` by which let hudi manage it own relation.. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. use the `BaseFileOnlyViewRelation` to manage the relation of COW tables in Snapshot-Query and Read_Optimized mode and MOR tables in Read_Optimized mode instead of `HadoopFSRelation`.\r\n2. implement `HoodieFileScanRDD` which is used in `BaseFileOnlyViewRelation` and is similar to `FileScanRDD` in spark, but extract the needed columns and return `Row` iterator not `InternalRow`.\r\n3. unify some common functions in `HoodieDataSourceHelper `.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThe build of Hudi website is broken due to the following error from `npm run build`:\r\n```\r\n(asf-site)> npm run build\r\n\r\n> hudi@0.0.0 build\r\n>

is that docusaurus versions specified in `website/package.json` are not honored.  Looking at the `website/package-lock.json` generated, `2.0.0-beta.15` is actually used instead of `^2.0.0-beta.3` (up to 2.0.0-beta.3) specified.  Another evidence of higher version already used is that `2.0.0-beta.14` shows up in generated content:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./content/docs/next/clustering/index.html:<meta name=\"generator\" content=\"Docusaurus v2.0.0-beta.14\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe build failure is due to the recent new version, `2.0.0-beta.15` of docusaurus and related dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to bound the docusaurus version properly.\r\n\r\nNote that the build failure can only be reproduced from a fresh clone of the branch from remote, with `npm install` and `npm run build` under `website` folder.  If there is a previous successful build and package info is cached, such build failure may not show up.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Updates `website/package.json` to bound the docusaurus version properly.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThe change is verified by a fresh build of the website.  The website can be successfully launched after `npm start`.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support for asynchronous metadata indexing. Please see the [RFC](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/4640) for the design.\r\n- An index planner in `ScheduleIndexActionExecutor`.\r\n- Index plan executor in `RunIndexActionExecutor`.\r\n- Adding `index` API in `HoodieTableMetadataWriter`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add a new action called `INDEX`, whose state transition is described in the RFC.\r\n- Changes in timeline to support the new action.\r\n- Add an index planner in `ScheduleIndexActionExecutor`.\r\n- Add index plan executor in `RunIndexActionExecutor`.\r\n- Add 3 APIs in `HoodieTableMetadataWriter`; a) `scheduleIndex`: will generate an index plan based on latest completed instant, initialize file groups and add a requested `INDEX` instant, b) `index`: executes the index plan and also takes care of writes that happened after indexing was requested, c) `dropIndex`: will drop index by removing the given metadata partition.\r\n- Add 2 new table configs to serve as the source of truth for inflight and completed indexes.\r\n- Support upgrade/downgrade taking care of the newly added configs.\r\n- Add tool to trigger indexing in `HoodieIndexer`.\r\n![async_indexer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/513218/160152135-3b280c8c-d8b6-483b-ac0b-d4b7ca9f52fe.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\n  - Added test for the indexer with continuous deltastreamer.\r\n  - Added test for timeline changes.\r\n  - Manually verified the functionality by running the indexer with concurrent spark datasource writes. Here's a [gist](https://gist.github.com/codope/01ca21bce3bcbc33f2d4a91027e53920) containing scripts used for testing. Below is the screenshot of the hoodie data/metadata timeline and partition.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is
