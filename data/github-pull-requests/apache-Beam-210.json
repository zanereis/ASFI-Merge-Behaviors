adds a module `beam-vendor-guava-20` that is just a namespaced redistribution of Guava 20.0.

changes:\r\n* Adds DelayedApplication\r\n* Adds PROCESS_ELEMENTS\r\n* Changes key type of PROCESS_KEYED_ELEMENTS, SplittableParDoViaKeyedWorkItems, and everything related to be byte[], so that it can be portable (non-Java SDKs don't understand String)\r\n\r\nMajor changes runner side:\r\n* In ReferenceRunner, adds two pipeline transformations for executing SDFs:\r\n** Replaces SPLITTABLE_PROCESS_KEYED with a GBKO, followed by a runner-specific \"feed\" transform (`KWI<byte[], KV<InputT, RestrictionT>>` -> `KV<InputT, RestrictionT>`), followed by PROCESS_ELEMENTS.\r\n** Then fusion happens, and after that we replace \"feed\" followed by an ExecutableStage with a runner-specific \"splittable remote stage\" transform. It's a transform that takes KWI's and feeds them into an ExecutableStage where it is assumed that the stage starts with a PROCESS_ELEMENTS transform.\r\n* Introduces an evaluator for the latter: SplittableRemoteStageEvaluatorFactory. It works almost exactly like ProcessFn used to (via state and timers - encapsulated into a runner-agnostic utility class SDFFeederViaStateAndTimers), but portably, according to the https://s.apache.org/beam-breaking-fusion protocol.\r\n\r\nMajor changes Java harness side:\r\n* Introduces BundleSplitListener, which any PTransform can invoke to signal that it has split itself.\r\n* Makes ProcessBundleHandler collect the splits and ship them to the runner via progress updates.\r\n* Refactors FnApiDoFnRunner into two helper classes: DoFnPTransformRunnerFactory that contains various bookkeeping logic (e.g. wiring inputs and outputs, instantiating coders), and FnApiStateAccessor that contains logic for accessing state and side inputs.\r\n* Removes a bunch of dead code from FnApiDoFnRunnerFactory (start/finish bundle contexts don't need to implement ArgumentProvider)\r\n* Removes also the old Factory from FnApiDoFnRunner, and refactors its tests to use the PAR_DO transform and the new factory in all cases\r\n* Introduces SplittableProcessElementsRunner which also uses DoFnPTransformRunnerFactory for bookkeeping, StateAccessor for side inputs (which I haven't tested), and runs the SDF and invokes BundleSplitListener when it splits.\r\n\r\nOf all this, a different runner could reuse:\r\n* The runner-agnostic class SDFFeederViaStateAndTimers (I am not sure that the pipeline graph manipulation code will be equally reusable - we'll see about that when this gets added to Flink; but it's not directly reusable for Dataflow)\r\n* All the Java harness code, of course\r\n\r\nReference runner is not yet a first-class \"runner\" capable of ValidatesRunner tests, so I added a hand-crafted test, copying the simplest possible SDF test.","created_at":"2018-06-05T23:25:21Z","updated_at":"2018-06-26T01:56:32Z","closed_at":"2018-06-25T21:52:19Z","merged_at":"2018-06-25T21:52:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"34e6936c097330e39a9f1bda57eaad7c10d5be69","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5566/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/5566/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/5566/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/78c4c2f1c5b0a5fabdaccd209ce3da57a57c38e9","head":{"label":"jkff:sdf-reference-runner","ref":"sdf-reference-runner","sha":"78c4c2f1c5b0a5fabdaccd209ce3da57a57c38e9","user":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53902119,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzkwMjExOQ==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"jkff/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkff","id":343722,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MzcyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/343722?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff","html_url":"https://github.com/jkff","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkff/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkff/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

identify). I added this new generation mode for Nexmark to be able to test the PortableRunner. However when the Nexmark executions produce different results.\r\nI print the generated events (the input of the different queries) and both (the ParDo based and the Source generator) produce exactly the same output (I validate this in `EventGeneratorDoFnTest#testGeneratesSameEvents`). \r\n\r\nDo you have any idea why this can be wrong? am I missing something that can change the results?\r\nAs a

Of note is that the current go implementation for Top uses an unencodable accumulator type (it contains []interface{}) so it is unable to be lifted at present.
