fixture for CLI tests requiring sample dags\r\n\r\nI noticed that various CLI tests were failing (specifically in test_task_command.py) when run locally but not when run in breeze.  I figured out the cause is that breeze has ('core', 'load_examples') set to true but I had it false locally.  To fix this we can add a fixture that patches the conf settings.  But we have to go one step further.  If we grab the conf value in the default for the argument in DagBag, this means the value is fixed at the time the class gets defined.  So the value cannot be changed later in runtime!  The solution is to resolve the default on the fly each time an instance is created.","created_at":"2022-09-20T19:25:47Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T10:11:46Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T04:37:18Z","merged_at":"2022-09-21T04:37:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"3cd4df16d4f383c27f7fc6bd932bca1f83ab9977","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

a dag with a mapped downstream tasks that depends on a mapped upstream tasks that have some mapped indexes removed is rerun, we run into a deadlock because the trigger rules evaluation is not accounting for removed task instances.\r\n\r\nThe fix for the deadlocks was to account for the removed task instances where possible in the trigger rules\r\n\r\nIn this fix, I added a case where if we set flag_upstream_failed, then for the removed task instance, the downstream of that task instance will be removed. That's if the upstream with index 3 is removed, then downstream with index 3 will also be removed if flag_upstream_failed is set to True.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T10:48:18Z","updated_at":"2022-09-22T15:18:49Z","closed_at":"2022-09-21T12:52:45Z","merged_at":"2022-09-21T12:52:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"e91637f8894cac19c6b467b6669cbcc13184be70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172803017,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAzMDE3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:bug-fix","name":"type:bug-fix","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

was creating a DB migration today (`alembic revision -m \"<my description here>\"`) and the post write script was failing since it could not find the `isort` module. I made sure my dev virtualenv was up to date (`pip install --upgrade -e \".[devel,<OTHER EXTRAS>]\"`) but still got the issue.

#23638\r\n\r\nThe implementation provides basic owner management over the user-defined owner field coming from DAGs. The implementation is functional. I tested over multiple cases such as those below. \r\n```\r\ndag1_owner:team1,team2\r\ndag2_owner:team1\r\ndag3_owner:team3\r\ndag4_owner:team4,team5\r\n\r\nuser1:team1\r\nuser2:team3,team4\r\nuser3:team2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is exactly acting as stated in the issue. We will have resources such as `OWNER:team1`. It will be generated by unique team names given to the DAGs owner field. It has the same behavior as DAG resources such as `DAG:dag1`.So that, we can now add permission to a role such as below. \r\n```\r\ncan read on OWNER:team1 \r\ncan edit on OWNER:team1\r\ncan delete on OWNER:team1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Important Note:** It is not ready to be merged. I haven't implemented the unit tests because I want to ensure the approach is good. After deciding on the approach and finalizing the functional implementation, I will implement the unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-19T00:30:11Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T22:31:49Z","closed_at":"2022-11-14T15:27:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"936ca8403a59fde6635857433b02e95bf2915c3a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver

refactor of SlackWebhookHook with breaking changes.\r\nI tried to minimise breaking changes, however main (and hope the only once) braking change SlackWebhookHook not anymore inherit from `airflow.providers.http.hooks.http.HttpHook` anymore and use slack_sdk.WebhookClient instead\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n1. Warn user that it is not safe to specify webhook token (url) directly in the Hook and suggest to switch to Airflow Connections.\r\n2. Deprecate specify webhook message attribute in `__init__` method and mainly use hook attributes only for configure slack_sdk.WebhookClient. It is still possible to set as Hook arguments.\r\n3. Inform users (always) that it is not possible to change channel, username and icon by use Slack Incoming Webhook. Users might previously use for two reasons:\r\n   a. Hook and Operators not cover this part\r\n   b. Hook initially created for use with Legacy Incoming Webhooks based on Slack Integration\r\n4. Change SlackWebhookHook arguments in Operators \r\n5. Add documentation for Slack Incoming Webhook connection type\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3998685/190858233-61a9a043-bd73-4f6c-9819-25610ae81f9d.png)\r\n\r\nFundamental

#21877 we no longer parse the dag as part of --local task run.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence it reads dag file location from the database.  But if the dag file is in a different path on the k8s executor worker, then this will be the wrong path.  We can fix this by respecting the subdir from the top level command.\r\n\r\nOne problem is, at least with k8s executor (and maybe others too?), the way it builds the pod args, it sets subdir=DAGS_FOLDER which means that all dags in the folder get parsed, which, we should avoid somehow.  So, have to work on this more and see whether we can improve that.\r\n\r\nIt may be easier to just store the relative loc in the

SVG images embedded via <img> tag are not the best when it comes to accessibility (even if we have \"alt\" descriptions). The SVG images are pre-rendered before displaying in this case and their content is not readable for visualy impaired people.\r\n\r\nWe could try to embed the .svg images instead, which makes them better readable and accessible, but this is a bit complex and would make the BREEZE.rst huge. We could also embed it via raw html, but GitHub does not allow this.\r\n\r\nAnother technique which is recommended is to turn the images to raw version of the .svg files which (when image is clicked) render nicely in the browser but the browser actually turns the SVG source as part of DOM, making the image content accessible to screen readers.\r\n\r\nAnother positive aspect of this change is that you can actually copy&paste the text of the images when you click them.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

The current system relies on running a backfill job which a) is extremely slow and b) only shows scheduler-level logs, so the user would need to search for log files to see how their tasks actually ran!\r\n\r\nThis new system \r\n\r\n\r\n## Speed\r\n\r\nWith this new system, we see a notable speedup in between-task speed. The new airflow dag test command can load tasks immediately and not wait for a scheduler heartbeat or other irrelevant airflow processes.\r\n\r\n### Before:\r\n\r\nexample bash operator: 13 seconds\r\nexample python operator: 26 seconds\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\nexample bash operator: 6 seconds\r\nexample python operator: 16 seconds\r\n\r\n\r\n## Logging\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `airflow dag test` command would pass on scheduler-level logs. This gives essentially 0 useful information for a DAG writer, and would force them to seek out task.log files in their filesystem every time they run a test dag. To improve this, we now surface task-level logs to the command line. We also no longer have any scheduler-level logs as we are no longer using a scheduler!\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:48,310] {dagbag.py:522} INFO - Filling up the DagBag from /files/dags\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:48,967] {base_executor.py:93} INFO - Adding to queue: ['<TaskInstance: example_bash_operator.runme_0 backfill__2022-01-02T00:00:00+00:00 [queued]>']\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:48,973] {base_executor.py:93} INFO - Adding to queue: ['<TaskInstance: example_bash_operator.runme_1 backfill__2022-01-02T00:00:00+00:00 [queued]>']\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:48,979] {base_executor.py:93} INFO - Adding to queue: ['<TaskInstance: example_bash_operator.runme_2 backfill__2022-01-02T00:00:00+00:00 [queued]>']\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:48,985] {base_executor.py:93} INFO - Adding to queue: ['<TaskInstance: example_bash_operator.also_run_this backfill__2022-01-02T00:00:00+00:00 [queued]>']\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:48,991] {base_executor.py:93} INFO - Adding to queue: ['<TaskInstance: example_bash_operator.this_will_skip backfill__2022-01-02T00:00:00+00:00 [queued]>']\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:54,045] {subprocess.py:62} INFO - Tmp dir root location:\r\n /tmp\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:54,045] {subprocess.py:74} INFO - Running command: ['/bin/bash', '-c', 'echo \"example_bash_operator__runme_0__20220102\" && sleep 1']\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:54,053] {subprocess.py:85} INFO - Output:\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:54,055] {subprocess.py:92} INFO - example_bash_operator__runme_0__20220102\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:55,061] {subprocess.py:96} INFO - Command exited with return code 0\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:55,117] {subprocess.py:62} INFO - Tmp dir root location:\r\n /tmp\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:55,117] {subprocess.py:74} INFO - Running command: ['/bin/bash', '-c', 'echo \"example_bash_operator__runme_1__20220102\" && sleep 1']\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:55,124] {subprocess.py:85} INFO - Output:\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:55,125] {subprocess.py:92} INFO - example_bash_operator__runme_1__20220102\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:56,131] {subprocess.py:96} INFO - Command exited with return code 0\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:56,186] {subprocess.py:62} INFO - Tmp dir root location:\r\n /tmp\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:56,186] {subprocess.py:74} INFO - Running command: ['/bin/bash', '-c', 'echo \"example_bash_operator__runme_2__20220102\" && sleep 1']\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:56,193] {subprocess.py:85} INFO - Output:\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:56,194] {subprocess.py:92} INFO - example_bash_operator__runme_2__20220102\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:57,199] {subprocess.py:96} INFO - Command exited with return code 0\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:57,257] {subprocess.py:62} INFO - Tmp dir root location:\r\n /tmp\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:57,257] {subprocess.py:74} INFO - Running command: ['/bin/bash', '-c', 'echo \"ti_key=example_bash_operator__also_run_this__20220102\"']\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:57,265] {subprocess.py:85} INFO - Output:\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:57,266] {subprocess.py:92} INFO - ti_key=example_bash_operator__also_run_this__20220102\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:57,266] {subprocess.py:96} INFO - Command exited with return code 0\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:57,307] {subprocess.py:62} INFO - Tmp dir root location:\r\n /tmp\r\n[2022-09-14 14:37:57,308] {subprocess.py:74} INFO - Running command: ['/bin/bash', '-c', 'echo \"hello world\";
