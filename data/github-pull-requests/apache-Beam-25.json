pull request introduces stress tests for BigTableIO, designed to assess the performance under various conditions. The stress tests simulate dynamic load increases and evaluate the behavior of BigTableIO.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- Added stress tests for BigTableIO.\r\n- Implemented dynamic load increases over time to simulate varying workloads.\r\n- Added support for exporting metrics to InfluxDB or BigQuery based on the configuration parameter.\r\n- Added ability for user to configure Dataflow version in KafkaIO Stress test\r\n- Refactored the code of BigQueryIO and KafkaIO stress tests.\r\n\r\n[Writing job example](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow/jobs/us-central1/2024-05-02_08_52_55-12029090719076961312;step=Write%20to%20BigTable;mainTab=JOB_GRAPH;graphView=0?project=apache-beam-testing&pageState=(%22dfTime%22:(%22l%22:%22dfJobMaxTime%22)))\r\n\r\n[Reading job example](https://console.cloud.google.com/dataflow/jobs/us-central1/2024-05-02_09_36_33-12860157495285970930;step=Read%20from%20BigTable;graphView=0?project=apache-beam-testing&pageState=(%22dfTime%22:(%22l%22:%22dfJobMaxTime%22)))\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Background\r\nSuppose you have the following script\r\n```python\r\nfrom apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions\r\nPipelineOptions()\r\nassert False\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's is the behavior when running this script\r\n```bash\r\n$ python3 test.py \r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/chintala/./test.py\", line 5, in <module>\r\n    assert False\r\nAssertionError\r\n\r\n\r\n$ python3 test.py  -h\r\nusage: test.py [-h]\r\n\r\noptions:\r\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring `__init__` of `PipelineOptions` we make a call to `parse_known_args` with the `self._flags` field. The behavior of `parse_known_args` is if it is given `None` as an argument it will use `sys.argv` for the argument list and parse those. If `-h` is within the argument list `parse_known_args` will print the help statement and then exit the python process.\r\n\r\nThe ultimately means that if you run a python script that defines a `PipelineOptions` at top level and supply `-h` in the command line arguments your program will exist upon instantiating `PipelineOptions` which is undesired behavior.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nInstead of defaults `self._flags` to `None` we set it to an empty list instead. This means when we call `parse_known_args` it will never read from `sys.argv`.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-07T20:00:23Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T12:41:39Z","closed_at":"2024-05-14T12:41:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75dbf8724cfe261a22763aaa6db2817f10c1e73c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1738121359,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzM4MTIxMzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/python","name":"python","color":"e2d35d","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/30563/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/30563/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/30563/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/172c334987316879713b9c59b090f792cfe4616a","head":{"label":"nchint:options_help","ref":"options_help","sha":"172c334987316879713b9c59b090f792cfe4616a","user":{"login":"nchint","id":124839959,"node_id":"U_kgDOB3DoFw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124839959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint","html_url":"https://github.com/nchint","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":767732932,"node_id":"R_kgDOLcKsxA","name":"beam","full_name":"nchint/beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nchint","id":124839959,"node_id":"U_kgDOB3DoFw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/124839959?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint","html_url":"https://github.com/nchint","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nchint/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nchint/beam","description":"Apache

Fixes python backend container build issue. After update to debian bookworm openjdk-11-jre-headless package is no longer availabile in stable. Fix downloads the package from bullseye repo and uses apt to install. This was chosen instead of adding bullseye as oldstable to avoid package conflicts. There was an option to update to openjdk-17 but was not sure if playground code would be affected. \r\n\r\n2) Fixes java container build where for some reason maven uses offline  mode when doing `dependency:list`. Instead of removing offline (it was there for some reason) we just add `mvn dependency:go-offline` to preload the needed dependencies\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

a ProcessingTime queue to handle ProcessingTime timers to Prism's element manager, that can be appropriately controlled by the TestStream notion of time.\r\n\r\nBasic design is that the queue in the ElementManager doesn't contain the elements, but instead manages which stage needs to be notified when to inject queue elements into processing, and in particular, syncing it with existing watermark processing.\r\nThis allows continuing to have each stage maintain all the state for the stage, instead of splitting it between the element manager and the stages.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't yet complete #30083 which requires adding the hooks to handle real processing time via a clock. However, this should unblock simple test usage. Real time settings would require support for pipeline plumbing to enable/disable real time behavior and to inject ProcessContinuation elements into the queue as well.\r\n\r\nAs the PR was getting very large we stuck simply to the timer case.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
