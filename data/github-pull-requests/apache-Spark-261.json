What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition in the `ExecutorAllocationManager` that the `SparkListenerExecutorRemoved` event is posted before the `SparkListenerTaskStart` event, which will cause the incorrect result of `executorIds`. Then, when some executor idles, the real executors will be removed even actual executor number is equal to `minNumExecutors` due to the incorrect computation of `newExecutorTotal`(may greater than the `minNumExecutors`), thus may finally causing zero available executors but a wrong positive number of executorIds was kept in memory.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, even the `SparkListenerTaskEnd` event can not make the fake `executorIds` released, because later idle event for the fake executors can not cause the real removal of these executors, as they are already removed and they are not exist in the `executorDataMap`  of `CoaseGrainedSchedulerBackend`, so that the `onExecutorRemoved` method will never be called again.\r\n\r\nFor details see

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes adding option in file stream sink to retain only the last batch for file log (metadata). This would help on the case where query is outputting plenty of files per each batch, which compacting metadata files into one could bring non-trivial overhead.\r\n\r\nPlease refer [the comment in JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24295?focusedCommentId=16545577&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16545577) for more details on the overhead current file stream sink metadata and  file stream source metadata file index can bring to high-volume and long-run queries.\r\n\r\nAs this patch purges old batches and retains only last batch in metadata, metadata file index fails to construct list of files when we enable this option, and as a result file (stream) source cannot read the output directory. To re-enable reading from the output directory, this patch also proposes to add option in file (stream) source which ignores metadata information when reading directory. With this option, end users can also choose the faster one between in-memory file index and metadata file index when metadata file gets much bigger.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests.","created_at":"2019-02-20T02:55:31Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T00:43:22Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T00:43:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bf85508af58fe9a5ecebee7df0635b4d9cc0b72a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23840/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23840/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23840/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fa88d9edb6c5a4393eaacd18a4efba975d16fcb4","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-24295","ref":"SPARK-24295","sha":"fa88d9edb6c5a4393eaacd18a4efba975d16fcb4","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis proposes to add instrumentation for the driver's JVM CPU time via the Spark Dropwizard/Codahale metrics system. It follows directly from previous work SPARK-25228 and shares similar motivations: it is intended as an improvement to be used for Spark performance dashboards and monitoring tools/instrumentation.\r\n\r\nImplementation details: this PR takes the code introduced in SPARK-25228 and moves it to a new separate Source JVMCPUSource, which is then used to register the jvmCpuTime gauge metric for both executor and driver.\r\nThe registration of the jvmCpuTime metric for the driver is conditional, a new configuration parameter `spark.metrics.cpu.time.driver.enabled` (proposed default: false) is introduced for this purpose.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, using local mode and using YARN.","created_at":"2019-02-19T09:28:21Z","updated_at":"2019-03-05T18:50:11Z","closed_at":"2019-03-05T18:50:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"887811afbcd371cfcc5b2d4f18601459431d963a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23838/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23838/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23838/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3c86ea4567b6c96e7aeaaa847017b6d9a3cbee0f","head":{"label":"LucaCanali:addCPUTimeMetricDriver","ref":"addCPUTimeMetricDriver","sha":"3c86ea4567b6c96e7aeaaa847017b6d9a3cbee0f","user":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145986175,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDU5ODYxNzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"LucaCanali/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark supports writing to file data sources without getting and validation with the table schema.\r\nFor example, \r\n```\r\nspark.range(10).write.orc(path)\r\nval newDF = spark.range(20).map(id => (id.toDouble, id.toString)).toDF(\"double\", \"string\")\r\nnewDF.write.mode(\"overwrite\").orc(path)\r\n```\r\n1. There is no need to get/infer the schema from the table/path\r\n2. The schema of `newDF` can be different with the original table schema.\r\n\r\nHowever, the behavior is changed since https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23606 .  Currently, data source V2 always validates the output query with the table schema. Even after the catalog support of DS V2 is implemented, I think it is hard to support both behaviors with the current API/framework.\r\n\r\nTo me, `DataFrameWriter.save` is more like a simple IO API(e.g. file IO). It doesn't have to be involved with the `table` concept, otherwise: \r\n1. Overwrite: can be `Drop table + CTAS`, can be `Insert overwrite`, can be `CTAS`...\r\n2. Append: can be `Insert`, can be `Alter table add column + Insert`, can be `CTAS`..\r\n\r\nThings can be too complex if we decide to allow both with/without schema validation in one API `DataFrameWriter.save`. That is to say,  let's remove the expression `AppendData` and `OverwriteByExpression` in `DataFrameWriter.save`, since their behaviors are different from the API's. The expressions are still useful. We can use `AppendData` and `OverwriteByExpression` in `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable`, which is more appropriate.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove the new expressions in `DataFrameWriter.save`, and reenable ORC V2.  I am aware that the interface `SupportsSaveMode` might be removed in the future. But in the current stage, we should prevent the regression, and make sure the behavior is unchanged and predictable in future development.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-19T07:36:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T07:03:02Z","closed_at":"2019-03-29T07:03:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3894b98d0aa9a185bb14d100c59b376d16b02523","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23836/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23836/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23836/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2b6694d08a6cff8c41f15a5d189f3a8111dab4c7","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:FixDFSave","ref":"FixDFSave","sha":"2b6694d08a6cff8c41f15a5d189f3a8111dab4c7","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

In this PR I have changed that function so that the writeLock is not held while the condition is being evaluated.\r\n\r\n@cloud-fan & @gatorsmile This is a further tweak to the other cache PRs we have done (which have helped us tremendously).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHas been tested on a live system where the blocking was causing major issues and it is working

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark supports writing to file data sources without getting and validation with the table schema.\r\nFor example, \r\n```\r\nspark.range(10).write.orc(path)\r\nval newDF = spark.range(20).map(id => (id.toDouble, id.toString)).toDF(\"double\", \"string\")\r\nnewDF.write.mode(\"overwrite\").orc(path)\r\n```\r\n1. There is no need to get/infer the schema from the table/path\r\n2. The schema of `newDF` can be different with the original table schema.\r\n\r\nHowever, from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23606/files#r255319992 we can see that the feature above is missing in data source V2. Currently, data source V2 always validates the output query with the table schema. Even after the catalog support of DS V2 is implemented, I think it is hard to support both behaviors with the current API/framework.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to process file sources as a special case in `DataFrameWriter.save()`. So that we can keep the original behavior for this `DataFrame` API.\r\nThe PR also reeanbles write path of Orc data source V2.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-18T14:00:17Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T18:38:22Z","closed_at":"2019-02-19T07:38:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"18c0ac0fcfde333939ea2b720bdb5ccc872f412b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23829/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23829/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23829/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8316c07b6415a65901b5479f8b01f0ec548bfb40","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:DirectWriteFileSource","ref":"DirectWriteFileSource","sha":"8316c07b6415a65901b5479f8b01f0ec548bfb40","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR partially revert SPARK-26744. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/commit/60caa92deaf6941f58da82dcc0962ebf3a598ced and https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4dce45a5992e6a89a26b5a0739b33cfeaf979208 were merged at similar time range independently. So the test failures were not caught.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/60caa92deaf6941f58da82dcc0962ebf3a598ced happened to add a schema reading logic in writing path for overwrite mode as well.\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4dce45a5992e6a89a26b5a0739b33cfeaf979208 added some tests with overwrite modes with migrated ORC v2.\r\n\r\nAnd the tests looks starting to fail.\r\n\r\nI guess the discussion won't be short (see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23606#discussion_r257675083) and this PR proposes to disable the tests added at https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/4dce45a5992e6a89a26b5a0739b33cfeaf979208 to unblock other PRs for now.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark supports writing to file data sources without getting the table schema and validation with the schema.\r\nFor example, \r\n```\r\nspark.range(10).write.orc(path)\r\nval newDF = spark.range(20).map(id => (id.toDouble, id.toString)).toDF(\"double\", \"string\")\r\nnewDF.write.mode(\"overwrite\").orc(path)\r\n```\r\n1. There is no actions to get/infer the schema from the table/path\r\n2. The schema of `newDF` can be different with the original table schema.\r\n\r\nHowever, from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23606/files#r255319992 we can see that **the feature above is still missing in data source V2**. Currently, data source V2 always validates the output query with the table schema. Even after the catalog support of DS V2 is implemented, I think it is hard to support both behaviors with the current API/framework.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to create a new mix-in interface `SupportsDirectWrite`. With the interface, Spark will write to the table location directly without schema inference and validation on `DataFrameWriter.save()`.\r\n\r\nThe PR also reeanbles Orc data source V2.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-18T11:04:21Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T18:56:56Z","closed_at":"2019-02-18T14:00:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"290c078e83066104f8a7576d3a2ed6abb504fd77","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23824/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23824/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23824/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4e76ddeb9509c3bb7f94343fd434ced1adc54b44","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:SupportsDirectWrite","ref":"SupportsDirectWrite","sha":"4e76ddeb9509c3bb7f94343fd434ced1adc54b44","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch applies redaction to command line arguments before logging them. This applies to two resource managers: standalone cluster and YARN.\r\n\r\nThis patch only concerns about arguments starting with `-D` since Spark is likely passing the Spark configuration to command line arguments as `-Dspark.blabla=blabla`. More change is necessary if we also want to handle the case of `--conf spark.blabla=blabla`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT for redact logic. This patch only touches how to log so not easy to add UT regarding it.","created_at":"2019-02-18T07:58:25Z","updated_at":"2019-12-05T23:51:04Z","closed_at":"2019-02-26T22:53:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f31846dc5fd29fd565cb212c3c49c13a732323c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23820/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23820/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23820/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba3309390a695cad5a750b0ab771105d76f5a2d2","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:MINOR-redact-command-line-args-for-running-driver-executor","ref":"MINOR-redact-command-line-args-for-running-driver-executor","sha":"ba3309390a695cad5a750b0ab771105d76f5a2d2","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe `DateTimeUtils.toMillis` can produce inaccurate result for some negative values (timestamps before epoch). The error can be around 1ms. In the PR, I propose to use `Math.floorDiv` in casting microseconds to milliseconds, and milliseconds to days since epoch.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new test to `DateTimeUtilsSuite`, and tested by `CastSuite` as well.","created_at":"2019-02-17T15:05:43Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T16:20:21Z","closed_at":"2019-02-23T17:38:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f2ddfd92ef3719b9abf709021fc15f7876b61e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23815/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23815/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23815/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4b303bcd30aa90a4adfee7da9bad54b12d92fa35","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:micros-to-millis","ref":"micros-to-millis","sha":"4b303bcd30aa90a4adfee7da9bad54b12d92fa35","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIt was discovered that scikit learn was miscalculating GBT feature importances due to mistakenly normalizing each individual tree. This fixes the issue in SparkML (which appears to have followed what scikit learn did). See: https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11176\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested by running the following script:\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas\r\nfrom

spark.createDataFrame(pandas_df)\r\ntrain, test = df.randomSplit([.75, .25], seed=0)\r\ntrain2 = VectorAssembler(inputCols=california.feature_names, outputCol=\"features\").transform(train)\r\n\r\ngbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to convert time zone string to `TimeZone` by converting it to `ZoneId` which uses `ZoneOffset` internally. The `ZoneOffset` class of JDK 8 has a cache already: http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/java/time/ZoneOffset.java#l205 . In this way, there is no need to support cache of time zones in Spark.\r\n\r\nThe PR removes `computedTimeZones` from `DateTimeUtils`, and uses `ZoneId.of` to convert time zone id string to `ZoneId` and to `TimeZone` at the end.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested by

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new Catalyst type converter for `TimestampType`. It should be able to convert `java.time.Instant` to/from `TimestampType`.\r\n\r\nMain motivations for the changes:\r\n- Smoothly support Java 8 time API\r\n- Avoid inconsistency of calendars used inside of Spark 3.0 (Proleptic Gregorian calendar) and `java.sql.Timestamp` (hybrid calendar - Julian + Gregorian).\r\n- Make conversion independent from current system timezone.\r\n\r\nBy default, Spark converts values of `TimestampType` to `java.sql.Timestamp` instances but the SQL config `spark.sql.catalyst.timestampType` can change the behavior. It accepts two values `Timestamp` (default) and `Instant`. If the former one is set, Spark returns `java.time.Instant` instances for timestamp values.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new testes to `CatalystTypeConvertersSuite` to check conversion of `TimestampType` to/from `java.time.Instant`.","created_at":"2019-02-16T18:26:20Z","updated_at":"2020-01-31T04:31:52Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T13:09:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06903e06c62a20abe41aedb3dced8c42cc15ac39","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23811/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23811/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23811/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a2ec027b8b6b52c3cdaafdad8b86228a5fa21365","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:timestamp-instant","ref":"timestamp-instant","sha":"a2ec027b8b6b52c3cdaafdad8b86228a5fa21365","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

To avoid this, it adds child's output into `references` like `OutputConsumer`.\r\n \r\n```\r\n$ ./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf <- createDataFrame(mtcars)\r\nexplain(count(groupBy(gapply(df,\r\n                             \"gear\",\r\n                             function(key, group) {\r\n                               data.frame(gear = key[[1]], disp = mean(group$disp))\r\n                             },\r\n                             structType(\"gear double, disp double\")))), TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [count(1) AS count#41L]\r\n+- Project\r\n   +- FlatMapGroupsInRWithArrow [...]\r\n      +- Project [gear#9]\r\n         +- LogicalRDD [mpg#0, cyl#1, disp#2, hp#3, drat#4, wt#5, qsec#6, vs#7, am#8, gear#9, carb#10], false\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(4) HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[count(1)], output=[count#41L])\r\n+- Exchange SinglePartition\r\n   +- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[partial_count(1)], output=[count#44L])\r\n      +- *(3) Project\r\n         +- FlatMapGroupsInRWithArrow [...]\r\n            +- *(2) Sort [gear#9 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n               +- Exchange hashpartitioning(gear#9, 200)\r\n                  +- *(1) Project [gear#9]\r\n                     +- *(1) Scan ExistingRDD arrow[mpg#0,cyl#1,disp#2,hp#3,drat#4,wt#5,qsec#6,vs#7,am#8,gear#9,carb#10]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nAggregate [count(1) AS count#91L]\r\n+- Project\r\n   +- FlatMapGroupsInRWithArrow [...]\r\n      +- LogicalRDD [mpg#0, cyl#1, disp#2, hp#3, drat#4, wt#5, qsec#6, vs#7, am#8, gear#9, carb#10], false\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(4) HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[count(1)], output=[count#91L])\r\n+- Exchange SinglePartition\r\n   +- *(3) HashAggregate(keys=[], functions=[partial_count(1)], output=[count#94L])\r\n      +- *(3) Project\r\n         +- FlatMapGroupsInRWithArrow [...]\r\n            +- *(2) Sort [gear#9 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\r\n               +- Exchange hashpartitioning(gear#9, 200)\r\n                  +- *(1) Scan ExistingRDD arrow[mpg#0,cyl#1,disp#2,hp#3,drat#4,wt#5,qsec#6,vs#7,am#8,gear#9,carb#10]\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, it adds corrupt values for missing columns (via pruned columnar batches to Arrow writers that requires non-pruned columns) such as:\r\n\r\n```r\r\n...\r\n  c(7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 7.90505033345994e-323, 0, 0, 4.17777978645388e-314)\r\n  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1.04669129845114e+219)\r\n  c(3.4482690635875e-313, 3.4482690635875e-313, 3.4482690635875e-313, \r\n  c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2.47032822920623e-323)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich should be something like:\r\n\r\n```r\r\n...\r\n  c(4, 4, 1, 2, 2, 4, 4, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2)\r\n  c(26, 30.4, 15.8, 19.7, 15)\r\n  c(4, 4, 8, 6, 8)\r\n  c(120.3, 95.1, 351, 145, 301)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and unit tests were added.\r\n\r\nThe test code is basiaclly:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf <- createDataFrame(mtcars)\r\ncount(gapply(df,\r\n             c(\"gear\"),\r\n             function(key, group) {\r\n                stopifnot(all(group$hp > 50))\r\n                group\r\n             },\r\n             schema(df)))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n`mtcars`'s hp is all more then 50.\r\n\r\n```r\r\n> mtcars$hp > 50\r\n [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\r\n[16] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\r\n[31] TRUE TRUE\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, due to corrpt value, (like 0 or 7.xxxxx), werid values were found. So, it's currently being failed as below in the master:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError in handleErrors(returnStatus, conn) :\r\n  org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 82 in stage 1.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 82.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 198, localhost, executor driver): org.apache.spark.SparkException: R worker exited unexpectedly (crashed)\r\n Error in computeFunc(key, inputData) : all(group$hp > 50) is not TRUE\r\nError in computeFunc(key, inputData) : all(group$hp > 50) is not TRUE\r\nError in computeFunc(key, inputData) : all(group$hp > 50) is not TRUE\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also compared the total length while I am here. Regular `gapply` without Arrow has some holes .. so I had to compare the results with R data frame.","created_at":"2019-02-16T17:18:08Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:52Z","closed_at":"2019-02-20T02:28:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7ba1d94931c5513c5f6c8f44f72bbf4026b8a3d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23810/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23810/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23810/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1782252f73da448c039f8c28040aede11c528833","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-26901","ref":"SPARK-26901","sha":"1782252f73da448c039f8c28040aede11c528833","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`prepareSubmitEnvironment` performs globbing that will fail in the case where a proxy user (`--proxy-user`) doesn't have permission to the file. This is a bug also with 2.3, so we should backport, as currently you can't launch an application that for instance is passing a file under `--archives`, and that file is owned by the target user.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to call `prepareSubmitEnvironment` within a doAs context if proxying.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests running with `--proxy-user` and `--archives`, before and after, showing that the globbing is successful when the resource is owned by the target user.\r\n\r\nI've looked at writing unit tests, but I am not sure I can do that cleanly (perhaps with a custom FileSystem). Open to ideas.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-15T23:32:17Z","updated_at":"2019-02-22T19:18:56Z","closed_at":"2019-02-22T19:18:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d78ebf661fb1a2870798be40529da7e6e74fa379","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23806/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23806/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23806/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/224d4894790a6b5efd807650d003ed3c6f1cbebd","head":{"label":"abellina:SPARK-26895_prepareSubmitEnvironment_from_doAs","ref":"SPARK-26895_prepareSubmitEnvironment_from_doAs","sha":"224d4894790a6b5efd807650d003ed3c6f1cbebd","user":{"login":"abellina","id":1901059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDEwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1901059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina","html_url":"https://github.com/abellina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143883563,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM4ODM1NjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"abellina/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abellina","id":1901059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDEwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1901059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina","html_url":"https://github.com/abellina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abellina/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently aliases are not handled in the Aggregate Estimation due to which stats are not getting propagated. This causes CBO join-reordering to not give optimal join plans. ProjectEstimation is already taking care of aliases, we need same logic for AggregateEstimation as well to properly propagate stats when CBO is enabled.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch is manually tested using the query Q83 of TPCDS benchmark (scale 1000)\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-15T19:44:08Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T08:28:47Z","closed_at":"2019-03-21T02:22:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"98157b1cfdae2f019390539c88689b01e31a4a61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23803/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23803/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23803/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7c96209d8e2ee7aeac822266e6fee91a9f8fa382","head":{"label":"venkata91:aggstats","ref":"aggstats","sha":"7c96209d8e2ee7aeac822266e6fee91a9f8fa382","user":{"login":"venkata91","id":8871522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzE1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8871522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91","html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":170915684,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzA5MTU2ODQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"venkata91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"venkata91","id":8871522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NzE1MjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8871522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91","html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/venkata91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/venkata91/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces leveraging of subquery filters for partition pruning in file source.\r\n\r\nSubquery expressions are not allowed to be used for partition pruning in `FileSourceStrategy` now, instead a `FilterExec` is added around the `FileSourceScanExec` to do the job.\r\nThis PR optimizes the process by allowing partition pruning subquery expressions as partition filters.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new UT and run existing UTs especially SPARK-25482 and SPARK-24085 related ones.","created_at":"2019-02-15T16:25:57Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T07:40:06Z","closed_at":"2019-03-04T05:40:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a51cbbfc01dc2a445ef4051e3d153437c9066fef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23802/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23802/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23802/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d7d3504da5c5d525297ccd1542dccb79c5fae79","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-26893","ref":"SPARK-26893","sha":"7d7d3504da5c5d525297ccd1542dccb79c5fae79","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe test \"RequestExecutors reflects node blacklist and is serializable\" is flaky because of multi threaded access of the mock task scheduler. For details check [Mockito FAQ (occasional exceptions like: WrongTypeOfReturnValue)](https://github.com/mockito/mockito/wiki/FAQ#is-mockito-thread-safe). So instead of mocking the task scheduler in the test TaskSchedulerImpl is simply subclassed.\r\n\r\nThis multithreaded access of the `nodeBlacklist()` method is coming from:\r\n1) the unit test thread via calling of the method `prepareRequestExecutors()`\r\n2) the `DriverEndpoint.onStart` which runs a periodic task that ends up calling this method\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unittest.","created_at":"2019-02-15T15:32:12Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T20:27:55Z","closed_at":"2019-02-19T21:41:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"01af69f95e063b66c5c6559363677cbfcdd8b23e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23801/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23801/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23801/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ff92bf4e895122855754834b1faab94813046ab","head":{"label":"attilapiros:SPARK-26891","ref":"SPARK-26891","sha":"1ff92bf4e895122855754834b1faab94813046ab","user":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114023960,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQwMjM5NjA=","name":"spark","full_name":"attilapiros/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"attilapiros","id":2017933,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2017933?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros","html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/attilapiros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/attilapiros/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to extend the documentation of the Spark metrics system in the monitoring guide. In particular by:\r\n- adding a list of the available metrics grouped per component instance\r\n- adding information on configuration parameters that can be used to configure the metrics system in alternative to the metrics.properties file\r\n- adding information on the configuration parameters needed to enable certain metrics\r\n- it also propose to add an example of Graphite sink configuration in metrics.properties.template\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-15T13:25:00Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T16:10:35Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T16:10:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5097ec96e69e609c5d925647e4ce16f19df3ac34","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23798/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23798/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23798/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d0ecd0bbc7c4803784a045bdc1bfa2c608d290e9","head":{"label":"LucaCanali:metricsDocUpdate","ref":"metricsDocUpdate","sha":"d0ecd0bbc7c4803784a045bdc1bfa2c608d290e9","user":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":145986175,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDU5ODYxNzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"LucaCanali/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LucaCanali","id":5243162,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDMxNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243162?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali","html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LucaCanali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LucaCanali/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen task can't get required execution memory, it will call `spill()` of consumers to release more memory. After spilling, it tries again to acquire memory needed which is `(required - got)`. That's not accurate as actually `released `memory by spilling may not equal to size it try to spill. \r\nSo it may be better to acquire memory in more accurate size :\r\n- when released >= needed, acquire needed size.

this change, there was some code in the k8s backend to deal\r\nwith how to resolve dependencies and make them available to the\r\nSpark application. It turns out that none of that code is necessary,\r\nsince spark-submit already handles all that for applications started\r\nin client mode - like the k8s driver that is run inside a Spark-created\r\npod.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, specifically for pyspark, there's no need for the\r\nk8s backend to deal with PYTHONPATH; or, in general, to change the URIs\r\nprovided by the user at all. spark-submit takes care of that.\r\n\r\nFor testing, I created a pyspark script that depends on another module\r\nthat is shipped with --py-files. Then I used:\r\n\r\n- --py-files http://.../dep.py http://.../test.py\r\n- --py-files http://.../dep.zip http://.../test.py\r\n- --py-files local:/.../dep.py local:/.../test.py\r\n- --py-files local:/.../dep.zip local:/.../test.py\r\n\r\nWithout this change, all of the above commands fail. With the change, the\r\ndriver is able to see the dependencies in all the above cases; but executors\r\ndon't see the dependencies in the last two. That's a bug in shared Spark code\r\nthat deals with local: dependencies in pyspark (SPARK-26934).\r\n\r\nI also tested a Scala app using the main jar from an http server.","created_at":"2019-02-14T21:58:40Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T17:59:00Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T17:52:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"261f4d6f38ba9179b97c07fb1c651baad8cd75fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23793/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23793/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23793/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4b2f84854039d5e5a0fa2e2fbf0efb3ffef23566","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-24736","ref":"SPARK-24736","sha":"4b2f84854039d5e5a0fa2e2fbf0efb3ffef23566","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**KafkaSourceProvider** supports 'topic' option that sets target Kafka topic.\r\n**KafkaSourceProvider** can use 'topic' column to assign rows to Kafka topics for writing.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to treat 'path' option in start(path: String) and save(path: String) as alternative to setting 'topic' option. Path would designate the target topic when 'topic' option is not specified and will override 'topic' column value for topic.\r\n\r\nCurrently if topic in 'path' option is specified it overrides topic column and is overridden by 'topic' option (if present). IMHO this relation seems more straightforward than that specified in the ticket ('path' is the least precedence option).\r\n\r\nfor streaming it will look as follows:\r\n```\r\ndf.writeStream\r\n  .format(\"kafka\")\r\n  .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host1:port1,host2:port2\")\r\n  .start(\"topic\")\r\n```\r\nfor batch it will look as follows:\r\n```\r\ndf.write\r\n  .format(\"kafka\")\r\n  .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", \"host1:port1,host2:port2\")\r\n  .save(\"topic\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded and extended unit tests, local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe previous strategy for comparing Maps leveraged sorting (key, value) tuples by their _.toString. However, the _.toString representation of an arrays has nothing to do with it's content. If a map has array keys, it's (key, value) pairs would be compared with other maps essentially at random.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to add vectorized `dapply()` in R, Arrow optimization.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf <- createDataFrame(mtcars)\r\ncollect(dapply(df, function(rdf) { data.frame(rdf$gear + 1) }, structType(\"gear double\")))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n  - R 3.5.x \r\n  - Arrow package 0.12+\r\n    ```bash\r\n    Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"apache/arrow@apache-arrow-0.12.0\", subdir = \"r\")'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Note:** currently, Arrow R package is not in CRAN. Please take a look at ARROW-3204.\r\n**Note:** currently, Arrow R package seems not supporting Windows. Please take a look at ARROW-3204.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n\r\n**Shall**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsync && sudo purge\r\n./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=false --driver-memory 4g\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsync && sudo purge\r\n./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=true --driver-memory 4g\r\n```\r\n\r\n**R code**\r\n\r\n```r\r\nrdf <- read.csv(\"500000.csv\")\r\ndf <- cache(createDataFrame(rdf))\r\ncount(df)\r\n\r\n\r\ntest <- function() {\r\n  options(digits.secs = 6) # milliseconds\r\n  start.time <- Sys.time()\r\n  count(cache(dapply(df, function(rdf) { rdf }, schema(df))))\r\n  end.time <- Sys.time()\r\n  time.taken <- end.time - start.time\r\n  print(time.taken)\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Data (350 MB):**\r\n\r\n```r\r\nobject.size(read.csv(\"500000.csv\"))\r\n350379504 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"500000 Records\"  http://eforexcel.com/wp/downloads-16-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing/\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTime difference of 13.42037 mins\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nTime difference of 30.64156 secs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance improvement was around **2627%**.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\n- For now, Arrow optimization with R does not support when the data is `raw`, and when user explicitly gives float type in the schema. They produce corrupt values.\r\n\r\n- Due to ARROW-4512, it cannot send and receive batch by batch. It has to send all batches in Arrow stream format at once. It needs improvement later.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added, and manually tested.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-14T09:43:59Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:48Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T05:33:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5f0292a043a6c945840f265f6f6096a66051b90d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23787/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23787/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23787/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5a124cb87ff5ee6a033a60a9604b2d852ae4489c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-26830-1","ref":"SPARK-26830-1","sha":"5a124cb87ff5ee6a033a60a9604b2d852ae4489c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when running applications on yarn mode, the app staging directory of  is controlled by `spark.yarn.stagingDir` config if specified, and this directory cannot separate different users, sometimes, it's inconvenient for file and quota management for users.\r\n\r\nSometimes, there might be an unexpected increasing of the staging files, two possible reasons are:\r\n1. The `spark.yarn.preserve.staging.files` provided can be misused by users\r\n2. cron task constantly starting new applications on non-existent yarn queue(wrong configuration).\r\n\r\nBut now, we are not easy to find out the which user obtains the most HDFS files or spaces.\r\nwhat's more, even we want set HDFS name quota or space quota for each user to limit the increase is impossible.\r\n\r\nSo I propose to add user sub directories under this app staging directory which is more clear.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, looks, to use `from_avro` and `to_avro` in Java APIs side,\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport static org.apache.spark.sql.avro.package$.MODULE$;\r\n\r\nMODULE$.to_avro\r\nMODULE$.from_avro\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to deprecate and move both functions under `avro` package into `functions` object like the way of our `org.apache.spark.sql.functions`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, Java side can import:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport static org.apache.spark.sql.avro.functions.*;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand Scala side can import:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.avro.functions._\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and unit tests for Java APIs were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `ANY/SOME` subquery support in SQL.  \r\nANY/SOME syntax:\r\n``` SQL\r\nSELECT column(s)\r\nFROM table\r\nWHERE column(s) operator ANY \r\n(SELECT column(s) FROM table WHERE condition)\r\n```\r\nThe implementation is based on `IN` subquery. `IN` subquery can be regarded as a special case of `ANY` subquery whose operator should be \"=\".  As `IN` subquery will be rewritten as semi/anti join, the only difference between them is that `ANY` subquery should change the comparison operator.\r\n\r\nHere are some details:\r\n\r\n* There are 7 comparison operators can be used in `ANY` subquery: `=, <=>, >, >=, <, <=, !=`.\r\nAll of these operators will be directly used in the join condition. e.g.,\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT t1a FROM t1 WHERE t1b > ANY (SELECT t2b FROM t2)\r\n```\r\nwill be rewritten as\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT t1a FROM t1 LEFT SEMI JOIN t2 ON t1.t1b > t2.t2b\r\n ```\r\n\r\n* `a != ANY (select b from c)` is **not equal** to `NOT a = ANY (select b from c)` semantically.\r\n`a != ANY (select b from c)` returns true if `a` is not equal to all rows in the subquery's results.\r\nit will be rewritten as `left semi join c on a != b`. \r\n e.g., `3 != ANY(1,3,3,2)` returns true, `3 != ANY(3,3,3)` returns false.\r\nWhile `NOT a = ANY (select b from c)` returns true if `a` is not equal to every row in the subquery's results. It is a syntax sugar of `a NOT IN (select b from c)`. And it will be rewritten as `left anti join c on a = b`.\r\n\r\n* Currently, ANY/SOME subquery only supports  'EqualTo' operation when multiple columns are specified in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nn SPARK-25314, we supported the scenario of having a python UDF that refers to attributes from both legs of a join condition by rewriting the plan to convert an inner join or left semi join to a filter over a cross join. In case of left semi join, this transformation may cause incorrect results when the right leg of join condition produces duplicate rows based on the join condition. This fix disallows the rewrite for left semi join and raises an error in the case like we do for other types of join. In future, we should have separate rule in optimizer to convert left semi join to inner join (I am aware of one case we could do it if we leverage informational constraint i.e when we know the right side does not produce duplicates).\r\n\r\n**Python**\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\n>>> from pyspark import SparkContext\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import SparkSession, Column, Row\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions

user of [sketches library](https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-hive) reported an issue with HLL Sketch Hive UDAF that seems to be a bug in Spark or Hive. Their code runs fine in 2.1 but has an issue from 2.2 onwards.\r\n\r\nFor more details on the issue, you can refer to the discussion in [the sketches-user list](\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/sketches-user/GmH4-OlHP9g/MW-J7Hg4BwAJ)\r\n \r\nOn further debugging, we figured out that from 2.2 onwards, Spark hive UDAF provides support for partial aggregation, and has removed the functionality that supported complete mode aggregation (see [SPARK-19060](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19060) and [SPARK-18186](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-18186)).\r\n\r\nThus, instead of expecting update method to be called, merge method is called [here](https://github.com/DataSketches/sketches-hive/blob/master/src/main/java/com/yahoo/sketches/hive/hll/SketchEvaluator.java#L56) which throws the exception as described in the forums above.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCreated new abstract class `HiveTypedImperativeAggregate` which is a framework for Hive related aggregation functions.\r\n\r\nAlso, there seems to be a bug in `SortBasedAggregator` where it was calling merge on aggregate buffer without initializing them. Have fixed it in this PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe steps to reproduce the above issue have been stated in the google group link posted above but will repeat them here for convenience:\r\n\r\n**1. Download the following three jars from the maven repository in [here](https://datasketches.github.io/docs/downloads.html).**\r\n  - sketches-core\r\n  - sketches-hive\r\n  - memory\r\n\r\n**2. Launch `spark-shell` by adding the above jars in the driver as well as executor classpath and run the following commands:**\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndef randId = scala.util.Random.nextInt(10000)+1\r\n\r\ndef randomStringFromCharList(length: Int, chars: Seq[Char]): String = {\r\n  val sb = new StringBuilder\r\n  for (i <- 1 to length) {\r\n    val randomNum = util.Random.nextInt(chars.length)\r\n    sb.append(chars(randomNum))\r\n  }\r\n  sb.toString\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef randomAlphaNumericString(length: Int): String = {\r\n  val chars = ('a' to 'z') ++ ('A' to 'Z') ++ ('0' to '9')\r\n  randomStringFromCharList(length, chars)\r\n}\r\n\r\nval df = sc.parallelize(Seq.fill(1000000) {\r\n  randId,randomAlphaNumericString(64)\r\n}).toDF(\"id\",\"value\")\r\n\r\nspark.sql(\"CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION data2sketch AS 'com.yahoo.sketches.hive.hll.DataToSketchUDAF'\")\r\n\r\nval nDf = df.groupBy(\"id\").agg(expr(\"data2sketch(value, 21, 'HLL_4') as hll\")).select(col(\"id\"),col(\"hll\"))\r\nnDf.show(10,false)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3. You will see the following exception below:**\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Stage 0:>                                                          (0 + 2) / 2]18/08/19 00:47:24 WARN TaskSetManager: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0, gsrd259n31.red.ygrid.yahoo.com, executor 2): java.lang.ClassCastException: com.yahoo.sketches.hive.hll.SketchState cannot be cast to com.yahoo.sketches.hive.hll.UnionState\r\n\tat com.yahoo.sketches.hive.hll.SketchEvaluator.merge(SketchEvaluator.java:56)\r\n\tat com.yahoo.sketches.hive.hll.DataToSketchUDAF$DataToSketchEvaluator.merge(DataToSketchUDAF.java:100)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveUDAFFunction.merge(hiveUDFs.scala:420)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveUDAFFunction.merge(hiveUDFs.scala:307)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.aggregate.TypedImperativeAggregate.merge(interfaces.scala:541)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.AggregationIterator$$anonfun$1$$anonfun$applyOrElse$2.apply(AggregationIterator.scala:174)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.AggregationIterator$$anonfun$1$$anonfun$applyOrElse$2.apply(AggregationIterator.scala:174)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.AggregationIterator$$anonfun$generateProcessRow$1.apply(AggregationIterator.scala:188)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.AggregationIterator$$anonfun$generateProcessRow$1.apply(AggregationIterator.scala:182)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.SortBasedAggregator$$anon$1.findNextSortedGroup(ObjectAggregationIterator.scala:275)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.SortBasedAggregator$$anon$1.hasNext(ObjectAggregationIterator.scala:247)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.aggregate.ObjectAggregationIterator.hasNext(ObjectAggregationIterator.scala:81)\r\n\tat scala.collection.Iterator$$anon$11.hasNext(Iterator.scala:409)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.shuffle.sort.BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter.write(BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter.java:148)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.ShuffleMapTask.runTask(ShuffleMapTask.scala:96)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.ShuffleMapTask.runTask(ShuffleMapTask.scala:53)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:109)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:367)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1142)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:617)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:745)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**4.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn SPARK-25314, we supported the scenario of having a python UDF that refers to attributes from both legs of a join condition by rewriting the plan to convert an inner join or left semi join to a filter over a cross join. In case of left semi join, this transformation may cause incorrect results when the right leg of join condition produces duplicate rows based on the join condition. This fix disallows the rewrite for left semi join and raises an error in the case like we do for other types of join. In future, we should have separate rule in optimizer to convert left semi join to inner join (I am aware of one case we could do it if we leverage informational constraint i.e when we know the right side does not produce duplicates).\r\n\r\n**Python**\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\n>>> from pyspark import SparkContext\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import SparkSession, Column, Row\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/23383, the file source V2 framework is implemented. In the PR, `FileIndex` is created as a member of `FileTable`, so that we can implement partition pruning like https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/0f9fcabb4ac2e8afec14d010e86467372a85d334 in the future(As data source V2 catalog is under development, partition pruning is removed from the PR)\r\n\r\nHowever, after write path of file source V2 is implemented, I find that a simple write will create an unnecessary `FileIndex`, which is required by `FileTable`. This is a sort of regression. And we can see there is a warning message when writing to ORC files\r\n``` \r\nWARN InMemoryFileIndex: The directory file:/tmp/foo was not found. Was it deleted very recently?\r\n```\r\nThis PR is to make `FileIndex` as a lazy value in `FileTable`, so that we can avoid creating unnecessary `FileIndex` in the write path.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit test\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-13T15:55:01Z","updated_at":"2019-02-15T07:01:02Z","closed_at":"2019-02-15T07:01:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"055de6be9b85af943e60e38ac71231797ca501bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23774/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23774/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23774/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6ef6430bc38447ece444215d2fa6a4793ac4c467","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:moveFileIndexInV2","ref":"moveFileIndexInV2","sha":"6ef6430bc38447ece444215d2fa6a4793ac4c467","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOur feature importance calculation is taken from sklearn's one, which has been recently fixed (in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/11176). Citing the description of that PR:\r\n\r\n> Because the feature importances are (currently, by default) normalized and then averaged, feature importances from later stages are overweighted.\r\n\r\nThe PR performs a fix similar to sklearn's one. The per-tree normalization of the feature importance is skipped and GBT.\r\n\r\nCredits for pointing out clearly the issue and the sklearn's PR to Daniel Jumper.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nmodified UT, checked that the computed `featureImportance` in that test is similar to sklearn's one (ti can't be the same, because the trees may be slightly different)","created_at":"2019-02-13T14:13:54Z","updated_at":"2019-02-16T22:54:16Z","closed_at":"2019-02-16T22:54:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3320042cc854434194146bdc2383f3530eb9aa5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23773/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23773/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23773/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/678277a803fbdd45217c4677ea71b01239384941","head":{"label":"mgaido91:SPARK-26721","ref":"SPARK-26721","sha":"678277a803fbdd45217c4677ea71b01239384941","user":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94518128,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDUxODEyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"mgaido91/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mgaido91","id":8821783,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MjE3ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8821783?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91","html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mgaido91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mgaido91/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn SPARK-25314, we supported the scenario of having a python UDF that refers to attributes from both legs of a join condition by rewriting the plan to convert an inner join or left semi join to a filter over a cross join. In case of left semi join, this transformation may cause incorrect results when the right leg of join condition produces duplicate rows based on the join condition. This fix disallows the rewrite for left semi join and raises an error in the case like we do for other types of join. In future, we should have separate rule in optimizer to convert left semi join to inner join (I am aware of one case we could do it if we leverage informational constraint i.e when we know the right side does not produce duplicates).\r\n\r\n**Python**\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\n>>> from pyspark import SparkContext\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql import SparkSession, Column, Row\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAccording to Brian Goetz et al in Java Concurrency in Practice, the double checked locking pattern has worked since Java 5, but only if the resource is declared volatile:\r\n\r\n> Subsequent changes in the JMM (Java 5.0 and later) have enabled DCL to work if resource is made volatile, and the performance impact of this is small since volatile reads are usually only slightly more expensive than nonvolatile reads.\r\n\r\nCachedRDDBuilder. cachedColumnBuffers and CachedRDDBuilder.clearCache both use DCL to manage the resource ``_cachedColumnBuffers``. The missing ingredient is that ``_cachedColumnBuffers`` is not volatile.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, clearCache may see ``_cachedColumnBuffers`` as null, when in fact it is not, and therefore fail to un-cache the RDD. There may be other, more subtle bugs due to visibility issues.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these issues, this PR makes ``_cachedColumnBuffers`` volatile.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Existing SQL unit tests\r\n- Existing pyspark-sql tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T19:32:55Z","updated_at":"2022-05-01T01:16:41Z","closed_at":"2019-02-14T07:00:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"652b1879f1a3a0ba4a9284678ede6badc4dd83f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23768/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23768/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23768/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9e7974f1885dbefa268fad341f7f846aff0e772c","head":{"label":"bersprockets:SPARK-26851","ref":"SPARK-26851","sha":"9e7974f1885dbefa268fad341f7f846aff0e772c","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrior to this change, in an executor, on each heartbeat, memory metrics are polled and sent in the heartbeat. The heartbeat interval is 10s by default. With this change, in an executor, memory metrics can optionally be polled in a separate poller at a shorter interval.\r\n\r\nFor each executor, we use a map of (stageId, stageAttemptId) to (count of running tasks, executor metric peaks) to track what stages are active as well as the per-stage memory metric peaks. When polling the executor memory metrics, we attribute the memory to the active stage(s), and update the peaks. In a heartbeat, we send the per-stage peaks (for stages active at that time), and then reset the peaks. The semantics would be that the per-stage peaks sent in each heartbeat are the peaks since the last heartbeat.\r\n\r\nWe also keep a map of taskId to memory metric peaks. This tracks the metric peaks during the lifetime of the task. The polling thread updates this as well. At end of a task, we send the peak metric values in the task result. In case of task failure, we send the peak metric values in the `TaskFailedReason`.\r\n\r\nWe continue to do the stage-level aggregation in the EventLoggingListener.\r\n\r\nFor the driver, we still only poll on heartbeats. What the driver sends will be the current values of the metrics in the driver at the time of the heartbeat. This is semantically the same as before.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests. Manually tested applications on an actual system and checked the event logs; the metrics appear in the SparkListenerTaskEnd and SparkListenerStageExecutorMetrics events.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T16:51:42Z","updated_at":"2019-08-19T20:42:54Z","closed_at":"2019-08-01T14:15:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2dcb0a67875597ec5f8002ea89e6cb667ace69ce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere are situations where temporary checkpoint directory created by Spark. One example when one uses console sink. Such cases in the actual implementation `StreamingQueryManager` creates directory with `Utils.createTempDir` which will be passed to the appropriate `StreamExecution`. `StreamExecution` then does the following:\r\n* Creates the directory again\r\n* Resolves the provided directory\r\n\r\nThe problem comes when resolving happens. The `StreamingQueryManager` provided path doesn't contain `file://` scheme and because of this from local filesystem it can switch to HDFS for example (such case HDFS is the default filesystem).\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've added the following changes:\r\n* Creating the directory only in `StreamExecution`\r\n* `file://` scheme added to the directory\r\n* As it was not clear that the checkpoint directory was not created because of permission issues I've added an exception when checkpoint directory doesn't exist and creation is not successful\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests + started a query in client/cluster mode.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T13:24:55Z","updated_at":"2020-02-24T15:22:36Z","closed_at":"2019-08-08T11:31:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"190bab7dc5e9a9610aede0e459674b2bcbd5a1d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to support Arrow optimization for conversion from Spark DataFrame to R DataFrame.\r\nLike PySpark side, it falls back to non-optimization code path when it's unable to use Arrow optimization.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n```r\r\ncollect(createDataFrame(mtcars))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n  - R 3.5.x \r\n  - Arrow package 0.12+\r\n    ```bash\r\n    Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"apache/arrow@apache-arrow-0.12.0\", subdir = \"r\")'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Note:** currently, Arrow R package is not in CRAN. Please take a look at ARROW-3204.\r\n**Note:** currently, Arrow R package seems not supporting Windows. Please take a look at ARROW-3204.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n\r\n**Shall**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsync && sudo purge\r\n./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=false --driver-memory 4g\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsync && sudo purge\r\n./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=true --driver-memory 4g\r\n```\r\n\r\n**R code**\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf <- cache(createDataFrame(read.csv(\"500000.csv\")))\r\ncount(df)\r\n\r\ntest <- function() {\r\n  options(digits.secs = 6) # milliseconds\r\n  start.time <- Sys.time()\r\n  collect(df)\r\n  end.time <- Sys.time()\r\n  time.taken <- end.time - start.time\r\n  print(time.taken)\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Data (350 MB):**\r\n\r\n```r\r\nobject.size(read.csv(\"500000.csv\"))\r\n350379504 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"500000 Records\"  http://eforexcel.com/wp/downloads-16-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing/\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTime difference of 221.32014 secs\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nTime difference of 15.51145 secs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance improvement was around **1426%**.\r\n\r\n### Limitations:\r\n\r\n- For now, Arrow optimization with R does not support when the data is `raw`, and when user explicitly gives float type in the schema. They produce corrupt values. In this case, we decide to fall back to non-optimization code path.\r\n\r\n- Due to ARROW-4512, it cannot send and receive batch by batch. It has to send all batches in Arrow stream format at once. It needs improvement later.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests related with Arrow optimization cover this change. Also, manually tested.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-12T04:07:05Z","updated_at":"2020-03-03T01:19:52Z","closed_at":"2019-02-20T03:39:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2d0a6d3382c2c711b8d367be1aa794577d4f6119","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23760/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23760/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23760/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cfe947cc8fe6d8c9a5c262a5d2b0e6bb28955e33","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-26762","ref":"SPARK-26762","sha":"cfe947cc8fe6d8c9a5c262a5d2b0e6bb28955e33","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBefore this change, there was no way to allocate a given amount of\r\ndisk when using Mesos scheduler. It's good enough when using default isolation\r\noptions but not when enabling the XFS isolator with hard limit in order to\r\nproperly isolate all containers. In that case, the executor is killed by Mesos\r\nduring the download of the Spark executor archive.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this change introduces a configuration flag, specific to Mesos, to\r\ndeclare the amount of disk required by the executors and therefore prevent\r\nMesos from killing the container because the XFS hard limit has been exceeded.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI added 3 unit tests and tested my built version of Spark against a real Mesos cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-10T15:18:04Z","updated_at":"2020-01-03T00:08:38Z","closed_at":"2020-01-03T00:08:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f4695cda3c664806b66d897ef3510c05a0676d6d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406625202,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI1MjAy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MESOS","name":"MESOS","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fdca59ac9eaca23754e94e3cd758c2588154697b","head":{"label":"clems4ever:mesos-disk","ref":"mesos-disk","sha":"fdca59ac9eaca23754e94e3cd758c2588154697b","user":{"login":"clems4ever","id":3193257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTMyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever","html_url":"https://github.com/clems4ever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":169989039,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjk5ODkwMzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"clems4ever/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clems4ever","id":3193257,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxOTMyNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3193257?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever","html_url":"https://github.com/clems4ever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clems4ever/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clems4ever/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**The best way to review this PR is to ignore whitespace/indent changes. Use this link - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20650/files?w=1**\r\n\r\nThe stream-stream join tests add data to multiple sources and expect it all to show up in the next batch. But there's a race condition; the new batch might trigger when only one of the AddData actions has been reached.\r\n\r\nPrior attempt to solve this issue by jose-torres in #20646 attempted to simultaneously synchronize on all memory sources together when consecutive AddData was found in the actions. However, this carries the risk of deadlock as well as unintended modification of stress tests (see the above PR for a detailed explanation). Instead, this PR attempts the following.\r\n\r\n- A new action called `StreamProgressBlockedActions` that allows multiple actions to be executed while the streaming query is blocked from making progress. This allows data to be added to multiple sources that are made visible simultaneously in the next batch.\r\n- An alias of `StreamProgressBlockedActions` called `MultiAddData` is explicitly used in the `Streaming*JoinSuites` to add data to two memory sources simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThis should avoid unintentional modification of the stress tests (or any other test for that matter) while making sure that the flaky tests are deterministic.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This patch is modified a bit from origin PR (#20650) to cover DSv2 incompatibility between Spark 2.3 and 2.4: StreamingDataSourceV2Relation is a class for 2.3, whereas it is a case class for 2.4\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified test cases in `Streaming*JoinSuites` where there are consecutive `AddData`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds UT on testing SPARK-26082 to avoid regression.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces timestamp pushdown to Kafka relation to significantly speed up queries filtered by timestamp.\r\nBefore this PR, queries filtered by timestamp were performed as full-topic scans and filtering was handled in spark memory. For production topics with few days of history such query couldn't complete in a reasonable time and clients had to rely on manual offset computation. \r\nMoreover offset filters have to be specified during dataframe initialization (or table creation when using thrift) as Datasource's startingOffsets/endingOffsets option, which makes offset changes inflexible.\r\nTimestamp pushdown is a flexible solution which reuses existing datasources/tables and makes it possible to create dynamic queries or even live views.\r\nAs an example following SQL commands will create a **live view** displaying last 10 minutes of data stored in Kafka:\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE kafka_source USING kafka OPTIONS (kafka.bootstrap.servers '$urls', subscribe '$topic');\r\n    CREATE or replace VIEW kafka_5_min as \r\n        select value, timestamp from kafka_source \r\n        where timestamp > cast(from_unixtime(unix_timestamp() - 10 * 60, \"YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\") as TIMESTAMP);`\r\n\r\nPR deals with SQL queries it doesn't handle streaming queries.\r\n\r\n## Technical notes\r\nTechnically `KafkaRelation`'s parent was changed from `TableScan` to `PrunedFilteredScan` allowing to use filter conditions and required columns projection. \r\nOperating only on required columns should result in lower memory pressure and slightly better performance.\r\nFiltering leverages `KafkaConsumer.offsetsForTimes()` method to compute offset ranges for filtered timestamps. Resulting offset ranges are merged with existing range filters specified as Datasource options.\r\n\r\nThere is another PR #23747 related to timestamp filter on Kafka table which handles timestamps as dataframe/table options during dataframe creation.\r\nIn practice 2 PRs supplement each other and they should be able to work together.\r\n\r\n## Restrictions\r\nThere is one technical restriction when using equals operator. Equals will not find element if it has the latest timestamp in its partition.\r\nExample with timestamp in milliseconds (ts):\r\n```\r\nTopic with partitions:\r\npartition 0 : [ (k1, v1, ts: 1001), (k4, v4, ts: 1002), (k7, v7, ts: 1004) ]\r\npartition 1 : [ (k2, v2, ts: 1001), (k5, v5, ts: 1002), (k8, v8, ts: 1004) ]\r\npartition 2 : [ (k3, v3, ts: 1001), (k6, v6, ts: 1002), (k9, v9, ts: 1004) ]\r\n\r\n-- OK, result [(k4, v4, ts: 1002), (k5, v5, ts: 1002), (k6, v6, ts: 1002))\r\nselect * from kafka_table where timestamp = 1002\r\n-- Not OK, result is empty\r\nselect * from kafka_table where timestamp = 1004\r\n-- OK, result [(k1, v1, ts: 1001), (k2, v2, ts: 1001), (k3, v3, ts: 1001))\r\nselect * from kafka_table where timestamp = 1001\r\n```\r\nThis situation is explained in unit test `timestamp pushdown on unevenly distributed partitions`. \r\nIn real world scenario with live traffic it is extremely unlikely to run into this scenario, however its still worth documenting.\r\n**Queries with OR condition (`timestamp > a or timestamp < b`) will not use pushdown, however they will return correct results.**\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n* Manual tests with queries to thrift JDBC/ODBC server connected to Kafka \r\n* Unit tests in KafkaRelationSuite

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces new options \"startingOffsetsByTimestamp\" and \"endingOffsetsByTimestamp\" to set specific timestamp per topic (since

timestamp.\r\n\r\nThe new option would be optional of course, and take preference over existing offset options.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests added.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to add vectorized `gapply()` in R, Arrow optimization.\r\n\r\nThis can be tested as below:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndf <- createDataFrame(mtcars)\r\ncollect(gapply(df,\r\n               \"gear\",\r\n               function(key, group) {\r\n                 data.frame(gear = key[[1]], disp = mean(group$disp) > group$disp)\r\n               },\r\n               structType(\"gear double, disp boolean\")))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n  - R 3.5.x \r\n  - Arrow package 0.12+\r\n    ```bash\r\n    Rscript -e 'remotes::install_github(\"apache/arrow@apache-arrow-0.12.0\", subdir = \"r\")'\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n**Note:** currently, Arrow R package is not in CRAN. Please take a look at ARROW-3204.\r\n**Note:** currently, Arrow R package seems not supporting Windows. Please take a look at ARROW-3204.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Benchmarks\r\n\r\n**Shall**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsync && sudo purge\r\n./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=false --driver-memory 4g\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsync && sudo purge\r\n./bin/sparkR --conf spark.sql.execution.arrow.enabled=true --driver-memory 4g\r\n```\r\n\r\n**R code**\r\n\r\n```r\r\nrdf <- read.csv(\"500000.csv\")\r\ndf <- cache(createDataFrame(rdf))\r\ncount(df)\r\n\r\n\r\ntest <- function() {\r\n  options(digits.secs = 6) # milliseconds\r\n  start.time <- Sys.time()\r\n  count(cache(gapply(df,\r\n                     \"Month_of_Joining\",\r\n                     function(key, group) { group },\r\n                     schema(df))))\r\n  end.time <- Sys.time()\r\n  time.taken <- end.time - start.time\r\n  print(time.taken)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Data (350 MB):**\r\n\r\n```r\r\nobject.size(read.csv(\"500000.csv\"))\r\n350379504 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"500000 Records\"  http://eforexcel.com/wp/downloads-16-sample-csv-files-data-sets-for-testing/\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTime difference of 5.195142 mins\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nTime difference of 12.64185 secs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe performance improvement was around **2465%**.\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\n- For now, Arrow optimization with R does not support when the data is `raw`, and when user explicitly gives float type in the schema. They produce corrupt values.\r\n\r\n- Due to ARROW-4512, it cannot send and receive batch by batch. It has to send all batches in Arrow stream format at once. It needs improvement later.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests were added\r\n\r\n**TODOs:**\r\n- [x] Draft codes\r\n- [x] make the tests passed\r\n- [x] make the CRAN check pass\r\n- [x] Performance measurement\r\n- [x] Supportability investigation (for instance

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch adds UT on testing SPARK-26082 to avoid regression. While #23743 reduces the possibility to make a similar mistake, the needed lines of code for adding tests are not that huge, so I guess it might be worth to add them.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNewly added UTs. Test \"supports setting fetcher cache\" fails when #23743 is not applied and succeeds when #23743 is applied.","created_at":"2019-02-07T14:55:31Z","updated_at":"2019-02-09T21:37:41Z","closed_at":"2019-02-07T16:56:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd0131873ffa94bfbbbd34eb890807dbcedf444f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/23744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/23744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8415f35ff878c2e6914d21b5258df95042ce21e8","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-26082-add-unit-test","ref":"SPARK-26082-add-unit-test","sha":"8415f35ff878c2e6914d21b5258df95042ce21e8","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror
