#28008\r\n\r\nOriginal case was that a user was not able to write to a table with a default column because StorageAPI Write SchemaTransform was performing a strict schema check. This PR removes that check because it's not deemed necessary as rows with mismatch schema will show up in the DLQ.\r\n\r\nThe user tried a workaround of including the default column in the input schema, but that didn't work because when we convert dict to Beam Rows (to ultimately use Java's Storage Write API), we attach the schema to the collection here: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/369265db4cd2aa294e6c4c4a4cfc1c8a9e4614c3/sdks/python/apache_beam/io/gcp/bigquery.py#L2237-L2240\r\n\r\nThis makes Beam throw an error when any Row doesn't match the schema. So even if the default column was in the schema, it wasn't enough because it expected that column to also exist in the Beam Rows. In this PR is a fix to populate any missing nullable fields with `None`. While experimenting, I saw that this is the behavior for `FILE_LOADS`

#27911\r\nFollow-up for #27740\r\n\r\nSwitch to using PeriodicImpulse instead of TestStream, which is only available on Direct and Flink runners.\r\n\r\nHad to make an addition to PeriodicImpulse to make it more streaming friendly. The default behavior is that PeriodicImpulse emits all instants from start until Instant.now(). After that, it starts firing at the specified interval. The changes here add an option to make it fire at the specified interval for all elements. This was needed to test schema update because in this test case we care very much about maintaining a consistent interval period between stream appends. \r\n\r\nOther changes include manually enabling streaming engine. The storage API sink uses GroupIntoBatches, which requires streaming engine. This streaming mode is automatically enabled in Runner V2 but not V1. \r\n\r\nAlso followed @Abacn's suggestion of only running the important tests on TestDataflowRunner so that we don't eat too many resources

now, when using multi_process_shared.py if any public member of an object throws an exception when `getattr` is called on it, the whole object cannot be loaded and an exception is thrown. Some objects, however, will return an exception if a certain attribute is not available on a given platform (even if it is not central to that object functioning). This PR fixes that problem and just logs when encountering cases like that.\r\n\r\nExample failing test run without the changes to multi_process_shared.py - https://github.com/apache/beam/actions/runs/5859613509/job/15885978842?pr=27995\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

change does 3 things:\r\n\r\n1) Uses `always_proxy=True` when using `RunInference` with large models. This guarantees that the model which is being shared across processes has a dedicated process to run in. This means that if a worker goes down, it doesn't have a chance of taking the shared model down with it if it was the one hosting it. This caused the hugging face and pytorch integration tests to fail because pytorch doesn't automatically gracefully handle sharing a model across processes.\r\n2) Updates the hugging face and pytorch model handlers to set `requires_grad(False)` after loading the models. [Gradients](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.Tensor.requires_grad.html) should already never need to be computed for Pytorch in inference mode and we correctly handle this when operating in a single process already with `torch.no_grad` ([example](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/16e7af2ea4148c65e3e1045e6c05f0d40f498db2/sdks/python/apache_beam/ml/inference/huggingface_inference.py#L175)), but when we proxy to the model in a separate process, that `no_grad` is not respected. This change fixes that and allows our tests to pass.\r\n3) Updates the TMPDIR env var in some of our tests to be a shorter path because multiprocessing relies on it being less than 80 chars long and pytest does not do that on Jenkins by default (it does locally, we just have a very long base directory name in our Jenkins tests).\r\n\r\nExample failing postcommit run before applying (2) - https://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PostCommit_Python39_PR/160/consoleFull\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

the original snippet, we create two instances of `Timestamp(micros=s)`, the later is rather short\r\nlived as we immediately use the `__add__` dunder\r\nmethod to create a brand new instance of `Timestamp`.\r\n\r\nThe change in this commit is to remove the construction of this short lived `Timestamp` and reuse the one already constructed for the `start` argument of `IntervalWindow`.\r\n\r\nThe speed gain of this change depends on the specification of the `SlidingWindows`. I have a pipeline that is relatively simple and with GCP's profiler in Dataflow, it revealed about ~2.5% of wall time is wasted in constructing this short lived `Timestamp`.\r\n\r\nGiven that `__add__` doesn't alter the `Timestamp` object inplace (and unlikely to be changed to that behaviour), I think this is a safe change.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
