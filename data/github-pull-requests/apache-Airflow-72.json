need to bump the version in main to 2.9.0. We do it a bit early because we also need to separate FAB provider that needs to have >=2.9.0 dependency on Airflow. But it's also \"proper\". The v2-8-test branch is already cut and we just cherry-pick changes to it, so technically whatever we work on in `main` branch is going to go 2.9 by default.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

change replaces a lot of bash code that was installing selected\r\nAirflow version (from pip, github or package) with Python code, while\r\nfixing a few outstanding issues.\r\n\r\n* Always remove Airflow code when you set \"use airflow version\"\r\n\r\nWhen we are running compatibility checks, we should not mount\r\nairflow from sources (not even skipping it), because if we removed a\r\nprovider, it will be imported from the mounted sources and the provider\r\nmight still be there.\r\n\r\nInstead of mounting airflow sources we use \"none\" which effectively\r\nremoves sources of airflow from CI image - instead airflow is\r\nentirely used from packages that are build during preparation of\r\nthe compatibility check (airflow from tag in git, and providers\r\nfrom the PR).\r\n\r\n* Split installation of airflow and provider into two steps\r\n  (Following best practices for installing Airflow in a reproducible\r\n  way (with constraints for that version) followed by installation of\r\n  extra packages (providers in this case using either specified\r\n  constraints or constraints from the main image by default\r\n\r\n* Extras can be used to perform the reproducible build for Airflow.\r\n\r\n* Better diagnostics\r\n\r\n* Removed a lot of Bash code\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor

happened\r\n\r\n_list_pods function uses kube list_namespaced_pod and list_pod_for_all_namespaces kube functions. Right now, these Kube functions will get the entire pod spec though we are interested in the pod metadata alone. This _list_pods is refered in clear_not_launched_queued_tasks. try_adopt_task_instances and _adopt_completed_pods functions.\r\n\r\nWhen we run the airflow at large scale (with worker pods of more than > 500). The _list_pods function takes a significant amount of time (upto 15 - 30 seconds with 500 worker pods) due to unnecessary data transfer (V1PodList up to a few 10 MBs) and JSON deserialization overhead. This is blocking us from scaling the airflow to run at large scale\r\n\r\nWhat you think should happen instead\r\n\r\nRequest the Pod metadata instead of entire Pod payload. It will help to reduce significant network data transfer and JSON deserialization overhead.\r\n\r\nCloses:

are currently [3 system tests](https://aws-mwaa.github.io/#/open-source/system-tests/dashboard.html) failing for the same reason: each system test creates security groups needed for `RedshiftCreateClusterOperator`. When running these system tests in parallel (which we do), these security group creations happen at the same time which can cause conflict. To fix this, we decided to stop creating these security group but use one already existing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR addresses the issues that were discovered out in the `EksCreateClusterOperator` deferrable mode. There are several changes made.\r\n1. `EksCreateClusterTrigger` did not set a status as failed, but the operator expected a `failed` status if the cluster creation did not go as expected. I've added a new `run` method that yields a `failed` status on failure.\r\n2. In `deferrable_create_cluster_next`, there was a bug where we were assuming the compute type could only be fargate or nodegroup. This is not true; the compute type can be `None` as well. This is fixed by adding an explicit check.\r\n3. Fixed a typo in the operator, and raised an exception on cluster creation failure\r\n4. In the `EksDeleteClusterTrigger`, there was a bug where the cluster would only get deleted if `force_delete_compute` was `True`.  \r\ncloses: #34844 \r\nrelated: #34966 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\nWe use Airflow to build our data pipelines. Our Airflow DAG graph includes 600+ DAGs, highly dependent on one another. A DAG may include ingestion for multiple tables from the same source. A downstream DAG may only need data from a single table and only need to take dependency on a single task instead of an entire DAG.\r\n\r\nOccasionally when an upstream DAG timeout due to whatever reason (higher volume of data, infrastructure issues, ...) we have an on-call rotation that fixes the issues based on the severity of the DAG. In general, we value no data over wrong/missing data. Hence, when an upstream DAG timeout, we would address the issue and ensure the upstream DAG rerun successfully prior to re-enable (clear) all the downstream DAGs. \r\n\r\nWith the default settings, when the DAG timeout, the unfinished tasks are marked as `skipped`, which is a successful state. With this, downstream DAG whose depends on the unfinished task will start even though the data not yet arrived/ not completed.\r\n\r\nWe previously fork `apache/airflow` to change this behavior to mark unfinished tasks as `failed`. We are working on getting rid of our fork and hope that we can expose this option to modify the state of unfinished tasks for our use case.\r\n\r\n### Other considerations\r\n\r\nAlternatively, with dataset, we can eventually convert our (600+) DAGs to depend on the data arriving rather than the upstream task instance. However, we are currently running Airflow 2.0.2 and working on upgrading to Airflow 2.7. Making our DAG depends on dataset is not yet available for our users. This change will enable us upgrade directly to `apache/airflow` v2.7 without maintaining our fork nor impacting our users.\r\n\r\n### Summary of changes\r\n\r\nThis pull request introduces a new configuration parameter `default_unfinished_ti_state` under `core` section. This parameter is used to define the state of unfinished tasks when a DAG times out. The changes involve adding the new configuration parameter in the `config.yml` file and modifying the `_schedule_dag_run` method in `scheduler_job_runner.py` to use this new parameter.\r\n\r\nConfiguration changes:\r\n\r\n* <a href=\"diffhunk://#diff-0a480a8b563e200f749424d7e761555e543588ff39a0b11cce7e34d522f38e0eR258-R264\">`airflow/config_templates/config.yml`</a>: Introduced a new configuration parameter `default_unfinished_ti_state` under the `core` section. This parameter is used to specify the state of unfinished tasks when a DAG times out.

This also helps in cases tests are adding/removing code in Airflow sources while testing, when several containers are running tests in parallel.\r\n\r\nHowever in case of static checks we still want to mount sources in order to make sure that all the sources (including ci scripts) ar coming from local sources rather than from the image, because those scripts in the iamge can have the main version of scripts from \"Build images\" workflow.\r\n\r\nInstead of forcing \"skip\" when tagged image is used. we are now settings \"MOUNT_SOURCES\": \"skip\" for the whole CI workflow, leaving \"SKIP\" only in case of mypy checks (as added in #36038)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

@vincbeck @potiuk\r\nHi all! \r\nI have opened a PR in main repository so more people can be involved in this discussion :)\r\nbased on the conversation in this issue https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/35234, i am trying to update BaseAuthManager() class to use FlaskApp instead of FlaskApi as suggested here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/35234#issuecomment-1793449425\r\nThe problem that i have faced is trying to update BaseAuthManager class will lead to errors on the users side who actually use this class with FlaskApi return type from method get_api_endpoints(). Another idea from the Robbe came to fix this problem by combining functionality from Connexion 2 and Connexion 3, but i am not sure how it will look like. Any ideas will be appreciated!\r\nThank you :)\r\nP.S. I am not an expert in this specific part of Airflow, but will be happy to become one :D\r\n\r\nCo-Authored: @RobbeSneyders  \r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This fixes the issue and add tests to prevent it from happening in the future. \r\n\r\nThe issue was that we decreased try_number in `on_task_instance_failed` as we wanted it to be the same as in `on_task_instance_running` (try_number is used to generate deterministic run_id). As it turned out, when `on_task_instance_failed` is called, the try_number is not yet automatically increased by Airflow, so we do not have to do that - it just need to be done in `on_task_instance_success`.\r\n\r\nIf You want to reproduce the issue run the below dag with OpenLineage integration, You should receive different run_id in START and FAIL event.\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id='test',\r\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 11, 30),\r\n    schedule_interval=None\r\n) as dag:\r\n    task = BashOperator(\r\n        task_id='run_bash',\r\n        bash_command='exit 1;'\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

PR introduces the [`sphinx-design`](https://sphinx-design.readthedocs.io/en/alabaster-theme/index.html) extension which provides numerous UX components such as tabs, cards, and dropdowns for documentation.\r\n\r\nThere are different ways or flavors of implementing or achieving the same result in Airflow whether that be in configuration, DAG authoring, etc. The current documentation explicitly lists these options as they appear which can lead to some lengthy doc pages as well as inconsistency in their presentation. Adding the ability to render these different options as tabs should combat both the verboseness and inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nCloses:

Mypy runs its check it uses breeze image to do so, and by default on CI the images are built using `main` version of scripts/ci and workflow files. This basically means that running static checks with the breeze image reguies mounting the sources if we want to run those checks on the scripts/ci/ folder or .workflow and breeze CI image is used.\r\n\r\nThe `mypy-dev` check is doing it - it checks `scripts/ci` folder, which means that for mypy checks we need to force mounting the selected sources rather than the ones that are baked in the image.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The proposal introduces SLAs that are measured and contained within the lifetime of a Dag Run, and within the lifetime of a Task Instance which cost significantly less for the Airflow Infrastructure to compute than the existing concept of SLAs. The proposed SLA callback functions will also accept the TI context as the argument, which is a parameter that is used by other callback types (on_success_callback, on_failure_callback, on_execute_callback) to honor a consistent interface.\r\n\r\n### Dag Updates\r\n#### Added \r\n        sla: timedelta | None = None\r\n        on_sla_miss_callback: None | DagStateChangeCallback | list[DagStateChangeCallback] = None\r\n\r\n#### Marked for Deprecation\r\n        sla_miss_callback: None | SLAMissCallback | list[SLAMissCallback] = None\r\n\r\n### Dag Run DB Updates\r\n#### Added \r\n        sla_missed = Column(Boolean, default=False)\r\n\r\n### DagCallbackRequest Updates (callback_data json payload)\r\n#### Added\r\n        sla_miss: bool | None = False\r\n        dagrun_state: DagRunState\r\n#### Removed\r\n        is_failure_callback: bool | None = True\r\n\r\n### Dag SLA Measurement Semantics \r\nSLA tracking logic is evaluated when the active Dag Run is checked for updates using DagRun.update_state which is executed in the main scheduling loop. Dag SLA is tracked for all run types except for DagRunType.BACKFILL_JOB if **sla** parameter is provided in the Dag definition. \r\n\r\nIf **sla_missed** attribute of the Dag Run is already set to True, the scheduler loop will skip the SLA check for that dag run. This condition ensures that the SLA miss callback is generated only once when a scheduler loop has detected that the dag run has just missed its SLA and has been made the corresponding Dag Run record update in the DB.\r\n\r\nSLA is measured against the time between the Dag Run start_date (time) and the current time. If SLA is less than the time between the current time and the Dag Run start_date, SLA has been missed for the active Dag Run. Using the start_date (instead of the scheduled start time according to the time table) allows us to keep a consistent measuring pattern across MANUAL and SCHEDULED run types, and keep the SLA evaluation logic simple for the initial version of this feature.\r\n\r\nSLA callback is indicated by the sla_miss boolean flag on DagCallbackRequest. The State of the DagRun corresponding to the DagCallbackRequest is propagated through the dagrun_state parameter, which is also used to deduce whether a on_success_callback or a on_failure_callback must be executed along with the request. It is now possible for a DagCallbackRequest to be issued without a finished DagRun State (SUCCESS or FAILED); it is upto dagrun.handle_callback function to parse the parameters and execute the appropriate callback related to the given DagRun State or sla_miss flag.\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nis_failure_callback is kept in DagCallbackRequest for backward compatibility, and is only used if dagrun_state parameter is not available on a given callback. This allows the Airflow instance to also be able to properly support DagCallbackRequests that were generated prior to the Airflow version upgrade, that have not yet been executed.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-02T15:38:56Z","updated_at":"2024-01-07T00:20:11Z","closed_at":"2024-01-07T00:17:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bcc6ee9bfe2d96c36dc598c5a61c054e281114fa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bolkedebruin","id":4282712,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3MTI=","avatar_url":"https://a

security policy was quite a bit too long and to unstructured to provide good guideline for the Security Reporters. It was basically a wall of text where - even if you wanted - you could not easily find the part that you could be really interested in - for example assessing the severity of the issue or what happens after you reported the issue.\r\n\r\nThe change is also not about the structure but also about the content that resulted from a number of discussions we had with securtity reporters - answering straight away the questions they had - for example how long they should wait for answer, how should they monitor if the CVE has been announced etc. etc.\r\n\r\nHaving a structured form also allows to link to the particular sections of the policy in case someone had not read and follow it - having it structured and linkable, make it much more fair to a) expect they will be read, b) point out (including pointing out negligence by the reporter) to the particular section. That sounds fair and reasonable if made it clear and directly answering questions the reporters might have.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

change codifies and explains assumptions and decisions made by Airflow maintainers with regards to capabilities of DAG Authors.\r\n\r\nWhile DAG authors are pretty powerful and capable actors in Airflow, they cannot do everything and Deployment Managers have ways to restrict their potential capabilities, especially in the context of influencing other tasks and common components such as Scheduler, Webserver and Triggerer.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a chapter explaining those assumptions and decisions and tell the Deployment Managers what responsibilities they have with that regards and what mechanisms they currently have available to limit capabilities of DAG Authors.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

With False, it is giving the correct status of the task and even retrying upon failure.\r\nThe error occurred because Operation object that is returned in trigger  after calling get_operation() method contains both error and response fields. That is why the first check if response exists in Operation object returns True every time even if the error occurred.\r\nThe actual content of those fields could be retrieved by calling SerializeToString(). \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

some cases you might want to override the default way how\r\nDocker determines where to connect by seting DOCKER_HOST variable.\r\n\r\nThis is generally working out of the box by having the variable\r\nset, but then it does not work well with `--builder` settings\r\nin `builder` plugin. This PR adds support for DOCKER_HOST to be added\r\nto all shell and build commands by disabling the builder when the\r\nvariable is set and explicit forwarding of the DOCKER_HOST\r\nvariable when running docker commands. You can also override the\r\nDOCKER_HOST variable via `--docker-host` command line switch.\r\n\r\nBuild arguments in Breeze commands have been sorted as well as their\r\nclick options as the command option list grew large enough to be\r\nmessy if they are not alphabetically sorted.\r\n\r\nWe also add automated support for docker-in-docker case which we use in\r\nsome tests - the Docker-In-Docker should now work in most cases even\r\nif you set DOCKER_HOST:\r\n\r\n* if the ~/.docker/run/docker.sock is used - we change the mapping\r\n  of socket to /var/run/docker.sock\r\n* if DOCKER_HOST is not a \"unix://\" socket, we pass it through\r\n  (hoping it will **just** work as tcp:// or ssh:// - named pipes\r\n  are not forwardeable anyway)\r\n* if Rootless Docker is used, we follow the rootless docker standard\r\n  for XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/docker.sock (fallback to /run/(UID)/docker.sock\r\n\r\nWithout DOCKER_HOST we just forward /var/run/docker.sock which\r\nshould work also on MacOS - with, or without root-owned socket..\r\n\r\nThis gets a litte tricky because the way it works on MacOS /\r\nDockerDesktop is a little magicalx. If you set DOCKER_HOST manually to\r\npoint to your HOME_DIR socket, you are actually supposed to forward\r\n`/var/run/docker.sock` not the original socket because mappings you\r\ndefine on MacOS are actually the VM mappings (and your home dir is\r\nmounted to VM - EXCEPT the docker socket which is available on the VM as\r\n/var/run/docker.sock)\r\n\r\nMore about it in this issue: https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6529\r\nAlso docs about MacOS Docker: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/permission-requirements/\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

After changing it to \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/airflow/constraints-main/constraints-source-providers-3.8.txt\", things work well.\r\n* BTW, I think https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/4a9824de8e063ee78a18583de24cd59718adc7f7/LOCAL_VIRTUALENV.rst?plain=1#L254\r\n\r\n`-e` flag works negatively here. I had spent quite some time with the environment errors when using this install command. After I had removed the `-e` flag, things started to work.\r\n\r\nWith `-e` flag, I got some errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR:airflow.configuration:cannot import name '__version__' from 'airflow' (unknown location)\r\nERROR:airflow.cli.cli_parser:cannot load CLI commands from auth manager\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `-e` no more works here, what about removing it?

#35288\r\nrelated: #35288 \r\n\r\nWhen a task is deferred then the same attempt is used to queue and resume causing the queued_dttm to be greater than start_date for an execution. This causes queued duration to be displayed with incorrect value taking queued_dttm - start_date which is not correct since start_date should always be greater than queued time. Also this causes start offset and to have a fixed queued duration bar width of 5. start offset and queued duration min width are shown only when queued_dttm is valid by being greater than start_date.\r\n\r\nBefore patch : (Incorrect queued duration of 23 hours and start of the bar is

The docs for [select](https://docs.python.org/3/library/select.html) state:\r\n>When the timeout argument is omitted the function blocks until at least one file descriptor is ready. A time-out value of zero specifies a poll and never blocks.\r\n\r\nI tested the fix with all the supported db backends and saw no adverse effects, but hopefully someone with more experience with `select` can tell if this is a reasonable approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request
