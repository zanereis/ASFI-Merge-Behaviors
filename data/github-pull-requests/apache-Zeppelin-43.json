What is this PR for?\n\nCurrently, all notebooks that binded to the same interpreter setting shares the same interpreter instance.\nFor example, let's say there're `spark-production` interpreter setting and all notebooks are using it.\nThen all notebooks share a single instance of SparkInterpreter, and that result all the variables are being shared across the notebook.\n\nBut sometimes isolated name space for variables per notebook is preferred. In this case we can create per notebook interpreter instance.\n\nThis PR provides generalized facility to provides per notebook interpreter instance, not only for SparkInterpreter but for any other existing interpreter without modification.\n\n**Design**\n\nIt provides toggle switch that user turn on / turn off this mode per interpreter setting.\nWhen per notebook interpreter is turned on, it still creates a single remote interpreter process per interpreter setting. But inside of the process, each notebook will have it's own interpreter instance and the instance is terminated automatically on removal of notebook or unbinding note from interpreter setting.\n\n**SparkInterpreter**\n\nBecause of the design keeps single remote interpreter process and creates multiple interpreter instance inside of it, SparkInterpreter become a problem. While multiple SparkContext can not be created on a single process. So this PR try to, create per notebook scala compiler instance, but share single SparkContext instance. In this way, each notebook can run job concurrently by leveraging fairscheduler of SparkContext without running multiple Spark application (SparkContext).\n\nAnd this approach is inspired by https://github.com/piyush-mukati/incubator-zeppelin/tree/parallel_scheduler_support_spark, this PR trying to generalize it for all other interpreters.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### Todos\n- [x] - Per note interpreter session \n- [x] - Scala compiler instance per note and share a single SparkContext (SparkInterpreter)\n- [x] - Handle Spark class server correctly\n- [x] - Handle SparkInterpreter Progressbar correctly\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-513\n### How should this be tested?\n\nCheck \"Per note session\" of your Spark interpreter setting. \nAnd create two different notebook and check scala variables are not shared.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nCheckbox to enable\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/13270280/e6db3686-da41-11e5-9408-8eaa9c2a7350.png)\n\nHow it works for

some code in order to bypass the test launched by grunt, and it doesn't seem right for `-DskipTests` to no skip the WebApp tests.\n\nIn order to apply that rule, we need to bump the version of

What is this PR for?\n\nThe goal of the PR is to add authorization for notebooks according to the design document [here](https://gist.github.com/prasadwagle/712b7ca1e0f1f4f1aa20).\nThe PR uses Shiro authentication.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### Todos\n- [x] - Find way to get roles for a user in SecurityUtils (Not possible at the moment, see SHIRO-492)\n- [x] - Investigate how to use Shiro authorization\n- [x] - Use groups associated with user to determine if operation is permitted\n- [x] - Check if user has permissions to modify note permissions\n- [x] - Add checks in more NotebookServer operations\n- [x] - Improve UI (explain permissions, error messages)\n- [x] - Add unit tests\n- [x] - Documentation\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nZEPPELIN-549\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Enable Basic Auth Security by changing conf/shiro.ini.\n2. Create a note. By default all operations are allowed by any authenticated user.\n3. Update readers, writers and owners by clicking on the lock icon in the top right area.\n4. Check if users can or cannot perform operations according to the permissions.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n[Screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/870829/12711820/c70fa336-c877-11e5-84e8-e282231988b2.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\n\nThis is a PR to add **utilities functions for the AngularJS system** and a new **Hide/Show Paragraph Id** feature. \n\n> See screenshots below to have a feeling of how it works\n#### 1) AngularJS Utility Functions\n- **`runParagraph('paragraphId')`** : run a paragraph given its id\n- **`runParagraphs(['paragraphId1', 'paragraphId2'])`** : run a list of paragraphs given their id\n- **`pushToServer('varName', value, parameters)`** : push a variable _varName_ with its _value_ to the server/interpreter **angular object repository** using current **noteId** and provided interpreter(s) (and optionally paragraph id(s)). _parameters_ is a map with the following properties:\n  \n  Ex: \n  \n  ``` javascript\n  parameters = {\n       interpreter: 'spark',\n       interpreters: ['md', 'sh'],\n       paragraph: '20160126-153136_1060166247',\n       paragraphs: ['20160126-171914_843040190', '20160126-181556_1915782845'],\n       scope: 'note',\n       runParagraphs: false    \n  }\n  ```\n  - **interpreter**: name of the interpreter to be used for angular object repository lookup\n  - **interpreters**: name of the interpreters to be used for angular object repository lookup\n  - **paragraph**: paragraph id used to update the angular object repository\n  - **paragraphs**: paragraph ids used to update the angular object repository\n  - **scope**: scope of the angular object, can be _note_ or _paragraph_. Default = _paragraph_\n  - **runParagraphs**: if _true_, run the paragraphs listed by the properties **paragraph** or **paragraphs**. Default = _true_\n    <br/>\n\nRemarks:  \n\n> 1. if both **interpreter** and **interpreters** are provided, the single **interpreter** will be added to    the **interpreters** list. Same remark for **paragraph** and **paragraphs**\n> 2. if a list of **interpreters** and **paragraphs** are provided, **for each interpreter the object will be pushed only to the paragraphs which matches this interpreter**\n> 3. if one or several **paragraph** is provided, the object will be pushed to the registry using the _(current note id, paragraph id)_ scope. This correspond to the default _paragraph_ value for the **scope** variable. However, it is also possible to save the same object to the _current note id_ scope. In this case set the **scope** variable to _note_. In this case the object will be saved using paragraph scope and note scope\n> 4. if **scope** = _paragraph_ and no paragraph id is provided, the object will be saved using the _current note id_ scope\n> 5. if **runParagraphs** = _true_ and no paragraph id is provided, it will be ignored\n> 6. set **runParagraphs** to _false_ if you want to push the variable to the back-end without refreshing paragraph\n- **`removeFromServer('varName', parameters)`**: remove the variable _varName_  from server/interpreter **angular object repository** using current **noteId**.\n  \n  Ex: \n  \n  ``` javascript\n  parameters = {\n       interpreter: 'spark',\n       interpreters: ['md', 'sh'],\n       paragraph: '20160126-153136_1060166247',\n       paragraphs: ['20160126-171914_843040190', '20160126-181556_1915782845']\n  }\n  ```\n  - **interpreter**: name of the interpreter to be used for angular object repository lookup\n  - **interpreters**: name of the interpreters to be used for angular object repository lookup\n  - **paragraph**: paragraph id used to remove object from the angular object repository\n  - **paragraphs**: paragraph ids used to remove object from the angular object repository\n\nRemarks:  \n\n> 1. if both **interpreter** and **interpreters** are provided, the single **interpreter** will be added to    the **interpreters** list. Same remark for **paragraph** and **paragraphs**\n> 2. if a list of **interpreters** and **paragraphs** are provided, **for each interpreter the object will be pushed only to the paragraphs which matches this interpreter**\n> 3. if one or several **paragraph** is provided, the object will be remove from the registry using the _(current note id, paragraph id)_ scope\n> 4. if no **paragraph** is provided, the object will be remove from the registry using the _current note id_ scope\n#### 2) Hide/Show Paragraph Id\n\n This feature is necessary for the above AngularJS functions to work. One can always retrieve the current paragraph Id using the code\n\n``` scala\n z.getInterpreterContext().getParagraphId()\n```\n\nBut it is far from being user-friendly. Therefore, now you can show or hide paragraph Id using a toggle. This is placed at the same place as Show/Hide line numbers.\n\nThe paragraph id is displayed at the top left corner, above the Title. \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/12614525/cce59d80-c500-11e5-8233-4f1c9e9c7c34.png)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/12614545/e480aa0c-c500-11e5-8278-611ea146d71a.png)\n\nI'm completely open to any suggestion with regard to the _location of the display_\n#### 3) Technical Impl\n1. First I have added a new **Thrift** method _angularRegistryPush()_. This method is used to push the current angular object registry from the Zeppelin server to the remote interpreter. According to @leemoonsoo, when a note is loaded from the JSON file, the interpreter **may not be initialized** yet so we need to store all the angular variables in the local registry. As soon as the remote interpreter is started, we can call the _angularRegistryPush()_ method to push the local registry to the remote interpreter\n2. A new public constructor has been added  to the `AngularObject` class. The reason is because when we push the whole `Map<String, Map<String, AngularObject>>` registry to the remote interpreter using _angularRegistryPush()_, the registry is serialized using **Gson**. At the remote interpreter side, the payload is deserialized back into a `Map<String, Map<String, AngularObject>>`. If a class **do not have a public constructor** then **Gson** will use some `Unsafe` tricks to create it (see **[here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18645050/is-default-no-args-constructor-mandatory-for-gson)**). Consequently, the `private transient List<AngularObjectWatcher> watchers = new LinkedList<AngularObjectWatcher>();` property will NOT be initialized and will throw `NullPointerException` later when the code access the `watchers`\n3. The `runParagraph()` and `runParagraphs()` Angular functions are injected into the **isolated scope** created for each paragraph so that people can access them. Currently I'm using the following trick to retrieve the paragraph details for a given paragraphId:\n   \n   ``` javascript\n   var paragraphDiv = angular.element('#' + paragraphId +\n                                   '_paragraphColumn_main[ng-controller=\"ParagraphCtrl\"]');\n   \n   var paragraph = paragraphDiv.scope().paragraph;\n   ```\n   \n    It's not the cleanest way. Ideally, we should inject into the isolated scope the `note.paragraphs` array from the Note scope but I'm not sure if it is recommended to leak such information into an isolated scope. Any idea/suggestion is welcomed\n4. New message operations **`ANGULAR_OBJECT_CLIENT_UPDATE`**  and **`ANGULAR_OBJECT_CLIENT_REMOVE`** have been added to support `pushToServer()` and `removeFromServer()` Angular functions. The core functionalities are implemented in `NotebookServer.angularObjectClientUpdate()` and `NotebookServer.angularObjectClientDelete()`. I also add 8 unit tests for those 2 methods. Similar to `runParagraph()`, the `pushToServer()` and `removeFromServer()` AngularJS functions are injected into the **isolated scope** to be available for end users.\n   \n   > A remark on the unit tests. I had to mock a bunch of classes for the tests, which suggest that the code is somehow entangled. I try to make the method as modular as possible but there are a lot of dependencies on objects like Notebook, Note, InterpreterGroup etc ... Maybe a general refactoring later would be nice\n5. The `ZeppelinContext.getAngularObject()` private method has been updated. Right now it look for variable using only the note scope. I change the code so that now, we look for a variable using:\n   - first _(noteId, current paragraphId)_ as key\n   - if no object found, then use _noteId_ as key\n   - if no object found, then look at the **global scope** \n6. Last but not least, **I have changed the current behavior of dynamic form**. In the method `Paragraph.jobRun()`, when we encounter a variable definition block ( ${var = ...} ) while parsing, we first look into the **angular object registry** using _(noteId, paragraphId)_ scope, then _(noteId)_ scope. If we find a matching variable we'll use it and **we do not create any form input for the paragraph**. At worst, we can just remove the last commit, it is independent from the other features.\n\n@Leemoonsoo  @jongyoul @bzz @felixcheung @corneadoug  I really need your remarks/comments for the above 6 technical points.

What is this PR for?\n\nWith this PR user will be able to set external libraries to be loaded to specific interpreter.\n\nNote that the scope of this PR is downloading libraries to local repository, not distributing them to other nodes. Only spark interpreter distributes loaded dependencies to worker nodes at the moment. \n\nHere is a brief explanation how the code works.\n1. get rest api request for interpreter dependency setting from front-end\n2. download the libraries in `ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo` and copy them to `ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/{interpreterId}`\n3. `ZEPPELIN_HOME/local-repo/{interpreterId}/*.jar` are added to interpreter classpath when interpreter process starts\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] Add tests\n- [x] Update docs\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-630\nAnd this PR will resolve [ZEPPELIN-194](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-194) [ZEPPELIN-381](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-381) [ZEPPELIN-609](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-609) \n### How should this be tested?\n1. Add repository(in interpreter menu, click gear button placed top right side)\n   \n   ```\n   id: spark-packages\n   url: http://dl.bintray.com/spark-packages/maven\n   snapshot: false\n   ```\n2. Set dependency in spark interpreter(click edit button of spark interpreter setting)\n   \n   ```\n   artifact: com.databricks:spark-csv_2.10:1.3.0\n   ```\n3. Download example csv file\n   \n   ```\n   $ wget https://github.com/databricks/spark-csv/raw/master/src/test/resources/cars.csv\n   ```\n4. run below code in paragraph\n   \n   ```\n   val df = sqlContext.read\n   .format(\"com.databricks.spark.csv\")\n   .option(\"header\", \"true\") // Use first line of all files as header\n   .option(\"inferSchema\", \"true\") // Automatically infer data types\n   .load(\"file:///your/download/path/cars.csv\")\n   df.registerTempTable(\"cars\")\n   ```\n   \n   ```\n   %sql select * from cars\n   ```\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n- Toggle repository list\n  <img width=\"1146\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-01-25 at 12 24 44 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8503346/12563475/52f060ac-c35f-11e5-8621-d8eb97b4d6a1.png\">\n- Add new repository\n  <img width=\"1146\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-01-25 at 12 25 23 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8503346/12563472/52eb545e-c35f-11e5-9050-a5306d2765f1.png\">\n- Show repository info\n  <img width=\"1146\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-01-25 at 12 25 28 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8503346/12563473/52ebab84-c35f-11e5-9acb-3a356c855dc7.png\">\n- Interpreter dependency\n  <img width=\"1146\" alt=\"screen shot 2016-01-25 at 12 27 27 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8503346/12563471/52eadd9e-c35f-11e5-8e1a-f583ea8800aa.png\">\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

Fix to allow using Zeppelin with the latest (Java 8 based) Geode see: [ZEPPELIN-375](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-375)\n#### Changes:\n- Make sure the that the `zeppelin-distribution` is build after the `geode` module. By default if you activate the geode profile (`-Pgeode`) the maven reactor will order the geode after the zeppelin-distribution. In result the geode is never added to the zeppelin binary distro. \n- Document how to build Zeppelin with Geode. Note that the only way to use Zeppelin with Geode is to build Zeppelin with `Java8`\n","created_at":"2016-01-24T00:49:45Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:21Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"073621a8e37ec4fdcf66a225379267b2d4577703","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/670/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/670/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/670/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/8f006bd4f71876a271918b6ec0ce6150e8be7373","head":{"label":"tzolov:ZEPPELIN-375","ref":"ZEPPELIN-375","sha":"8f006bd4f71876a271918b6ec0ce6150e8be7373","user":{"login":"tzolov","id":1351573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE1NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1351573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov","html_url":"https://github.com/tzolov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39763329,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTc2MzMyOQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"tzolov/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tzolov","id":1351573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTE1NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1351573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov","html_url":"https://github.com/tzolov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tzolov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tzolov/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nRight now the keyboard shortcut modal shows 'alt' but on macs 'alt' maps to 'opt'. Could be confusing to some people who don't see 'alt' on the keyboard on their macs.\n\nThere are many way to achieve this mapping. I used this to minimize code change and take advantage of when paragraphs check for appVersion to set keyboard shortcuts. \n\nOpen to suggestions on best approach to solve this problem. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-626\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Emulate browser to be Mac and open keyboard shortcut\n2. Emulate browser to be Windows and open keyboard shortcut\n### Screenshots (if

What is this PR for?\n\nFeatures developed for dynamic loads Notebook Storage Module.\nIn addition to the current Local Storage S3, it is possible to manage the notebook with Git.\nBut, at the same time you can not use another Notebook Storage Module, always include the Zeppelin Project shall be developed and downloaded.\n\nTo Solved, getting down the Notebook Storage Module from the Maven repository, and configure it so that you can dynamically load.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-546\n\n```\nparams:\n   artifact - maven artifact (groupId:artifactId:version)\n   className - Interpreter class\n   repository (optional) - additional maven repository address\n```\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [x] - Implement dynamic load notebook storage module in notebooksync.java\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-625\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-546\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Create a new Notebook storage module for testing.\n   example\n\n```\nmyNotebookStorage/org/apache/zeppelin/myNotebookStorage/MyNotebookStorage.java\n\npublic class MyNotebookStorage implements NotebookRepo {\n    ...implement interface method.\n}\n```\n1. maven local repository build.\n   incubator-zeppelin root directory path.\n\n```\nmvn install -pl '!spark-dependencies,!spark,!flink,!ignite,!lens,!hive,!phoenix,!postgresql,!tajo,!cassandra,!kylin,!elasticsearch,!zeppelin-distribution' -DskipTests\n```\n\nthen execute normal build.\n\n```\nmvn clean package -Pspark-1.6 -Phadoop-2.4 -Ppyspark -DskipTests\n```\n1. It calls for the implementation of the method.\n   (This is an example)\n\n```\nloadDynamicNoteBookStorage(\"org.apache.zeppelin.myNotebookStorage.MyNotebookStorage\",

What is this PR for?\n\nRight now, the Maven profile **cassandra-spark-1.5** is broken because an older version of Guava is used (**15.0** to be exact). This PR addresses this issue and also update the version of the Spark/Cassandra connector:\n- Guava version set to **16.0.1** because the spark-cassandra connector is pulling the Java driver **3.0.0-rc1** which requires Guava 16.0.1\n- spark-cassandra connector set to **1.5.0-RC1**\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Test by the community\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\n**[ZEPPELIN-620](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-620)**\n### How should this be tested?\n- Build Zeppelin with `mvn clean package -Pcassandra-spark-1.5 -DskipTests`\n- Download **Cassandra 3.2** here: http://cassandra.apache.org/download/\n- Unzip the archive somewhere\n- Edit the $CASSANDRA_HOME/conf/cassandra.yaml file to set\n  - listen_address: 127.0.0.1\n  - rpc_address: 127.0.0.1  \n- Start Cassandra with the command `$CASSANDRA_HOME/bin/cassandra`\n- Wait 10 seconds for **Cassandra** to start\n- Connect to the CQL client with `$CASSANDRA_HOME/bin/cqlsh` (if it fails, re-try after a few time because Cassandra may have not finished bootstrapping)\n- Create the following dataset in Cassandra:\n  - `CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};`\n  - `CREATE TABLE test.data(id int PRIMARY KEY, val text);`\n  - `INSERT INTO test.data(id,val) VALUES(1, 'one');`\n  - `INSERT INTO test.data(id,val) VALUES(2, 'two');`\n  - `INSERT INTO test.data(id,val) VALUES(3, 'three');`\n- Edit the Spark interpreter to add this property\n  - spark.cassandra.connection.host: 127.0.0.1\n- Create a new notebook **Spark/Cassandra**\n- Create a first paragraph to register the **Cassandra** table: \n\n```\n%sql\nCREATE TEMPORARY TABLE data USING org.apache.spark.sql.cassandra OPTIONS(cluster \"Test Cluster\", keyspace \"test\", table \"data\")\n```\n- Create a second paragraph to request data using SparkSQL\n\n```\n%sql\nSELECT * FROM data\n```\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nSpark interpreter config\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1532977/12419074/07c8ee32-beb4-11e5-809c-8a52224cf6ca.png)\n\nCassandra data

changes for older versions? --> No\n- Does this needs documentation? --> No\n","created_at":"2016-01-19T12:56:54Z","updated_at":"2016-02-08T03:33:35Z","closed_at":"2016-02-08T03:33:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3953ed93a7a93567df4582ffff5db9984c4a0bda","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/657/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/657/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/657/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/4e91064929bc2f13d63c0081ebf8611988aaa8ca","head":{"label":"doanduyhai:UpdateCassandraSpark1.5Profile","ref":"UpdateCassandraSpark1.5Profile","sha":"4e91064929bc2f13d63c0081ebf8611988aaa8ca","user":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35973266,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTk3MzI2Ng==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"doanduyhai/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"doanduyhai","id":1532977,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI5Nzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532977?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai","html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/doanduyhai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/doanduyhai/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

Reason about this issue is sqlline:sqlline:jar:1.1.8 is served from conjar repo. But sqlline:sqlline:jar:1.1.9 is served from maven repo. So add the dependency of sqlline1.1.9 can solve it.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nBefore\n`BUILD FAILURE`\n\nWhen you add this dependency\nAfter \n\n```\n[INFO] Zeppelin: Kylin interpreter ........................

What is this PR for?\n\nThe current default name for a notebook in create dialog is random, which is difficult to remember.\nInstead of randomly generating names it's useful to have a prefix \"Untitled Note \" + seq number.\neg: Untitled Note 1, Untitled Note 2 etc.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### How should this be tested?\n\nCreate note with default names populated in the field and check if the naming sequence is correct.\nWhen there are no notes with \"Untitled Note <num>\" the default name should be \"Untitled Note 1\", otherwise it should be max num + 1.\n###

What is this PR for?\n\nOutput from interpreter is displayed after completion of paragraph execution.\nIt'll be useful if output can be streamed to front-end during execution.\n\nPrevious work #593 injects InterpreterOutput stream object to Interpreter.\nThis PR is based on #593 and stream the data from InterpreterOutput to front-end.\n\nThis implementation only streams output is %text. Other output type (%html, %angular, %table) is not streamed to the front end.\n\nWhile this PR keeps backward compatibility, Interpreter who want to use this feature will need to modify code to write output into `InterpreterOutput` instead of return with `InterpreterResult`.\n\nThis PR includes modification of SparkInterpreter to use InterpreterOutput.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### Todos\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-554\n### How should this be tested?\n\nRun such code using Spark interpreter\n\n```\n(1 to 10).foreach{ i=>\n    Thread.sleep(1000)\n    println(\"Hello \" + i)\n}\n```\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![stream_output](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1540981/12188677/6df08900-b56c-11e5-95d9-e5f6fad91007.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\n\nThis PR is related to #590. This documentation may explain the overall process of **Dynamic Interpreter Loading** in [Helium Proposal](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-533). \nMoreover, at the last this documentation, Zeppelin users can get the basic information about step by step of interpreter setting & configuring & binding. Since I assumed that they are novice at Zeppelin.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nDocumentation\n### Todos\n- [x] - Add docs image under `/docs/assets/themes/zeppelin/img/docs-img/`\n- [x] - Add dynamicinterpreter.md\n- [x] - Add dynamicinterpreter.html location to `docs/_includes/themes/zeppelin/_navigation.html`\n### Is there a relevant Jira issue?\n1. [ZEPPELIN-533 Helium](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-533)\n2. [ZEPPELIN-546](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-546)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nI add a link of this documentation to `interpreter tab` in Zeppelin web page. \n![screen shot 2016-01-07 at 12 39 54 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/12182295/20711f30-b53c-11e5-8369-2ec42c99f4e2.png)\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\nHopefully, below image helps you to understand this process : )\n![zeppelin_user](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/12180839/b0240d30-b533-11e5-97e1-87c7833ee47f.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?
