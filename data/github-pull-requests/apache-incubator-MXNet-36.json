Other tutorials on Sparse NDArray exist but cover low-level details and Module API, not Gluon API. Also shows how to handle data using LibSVM, and why to avoid Dataset and DataLoader. And provides an implementation of a Gluon Block that can be used efficiently with sparse input (unlike nn.Dence).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

Description ##\r\nThere is some unnecessary complexity in the shorthand aliasing scheme this work aims to correct.

For example, `AI::MXNet::Context` the class vs. `AI::MXNet->Context()` the shorthand for `AI::MXNet::Context->new()`.\r\n- [x] Folds the '_' suffixed shadow classes enhancements into the full name classes.\r\n- [x] Retool of `register()` methods to not mangle stack traces.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- I believe these changes are backwards compatible to the documented API, and brings the API as a whole closer to the designed intent.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here, I was unable to convert `AI::MXNet::Gluon::Block->register()` to use the `AUTOLOAD` scheme even though it seems to need the same class vs. method collision avoidance as in other places.

this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\nAdd the docs for multinomial, dot, cumsum, clip, abs, exp and arctan.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis is the initial PR to start supporting Sparse `NDArray` for the Scala package. \r\n\r\n`SparseNDArray` is a child class of MXNet NDArray. It supports the following types:\r\n- row sparse\r\n- CSR\r\n\r\nCurrently, users can call `toSparse` method to convert a `NDArray` from dense to sparse or cast a `NDArray` to `SparseNDArray`. User can also call the following two methods to create Sparse NDArray from scratch\r\n- `SparseNDArray.csrMatrix`\r\n- `SparseNDArray.rowSparseArray`\r\n\r\n@gigasquid @zachgk @yzhliu @nswamy

refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAdd the docs for the numpy operators in title.\r\n`linspace` may need image in doc.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nImplemented the dsplit operator.\r\nIt seems indices are not allowed to be passed into the `indices_or_sections` parameter, so the corresponding tests are disabled.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAdd the docs for the above mentioned operators.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- three unary operators are registered to npi namespace, and wrapped in corresponding files\r\n- `mean` is registered into npi namespace, and wrapped to have same signature as in numpy\r\n- website building looks normal\r\n- unittests for operators still pass\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThank @reminisce , @haojin2  for reviewing\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-26T08:08:21Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T09:16:33Z","closed_at":"2019-07-03T09:16:33Z","merged_at":"2019-07-03T09:16:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"44e5b25743633812685716f9be60647cdc28607e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f2427153e27a7ed5847e0c85a08d00e5da1c21e0","head":{"label":"mikemwx:wenxu-doc-fix","ref":"wenxu-doc-fix","sha":"f2427153e27a7ed5847e0c85a08d00e5da1c21e0","user":{"login":"mikemwx","id":20072919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcyOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20072919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemwx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":188980347,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODg5ODAzNDc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"mikemwx/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mikemwx","id":20072919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDcyOTE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20072919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemwx","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemwx/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mikemwx/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis pr fix build with openmp by:\r\n1. find openmp using `FindOpenMP` module from cmake\r\n2. if not found, use build openmp from source using 3rd party submodule.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\nThis pr is a minor modification of `CMakeLists.txt`, simply find openmp firstly in the system, and then build from source if not found.","created_at":"2019-06-26T07:47:29Z","updated_at":"2019-07-03T01:23:26Z","closed_at":"2019-07-02T03:19:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eabc12b15e30f5db8a53fd37ddaf5090b0d99320","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe current MXNet build process adds external dependencies to the JAR, which may conflict with local dependencies on the classpath.  In my case commons-io was replaced by MXNet and caused some method-not-found errors.\r\n\r\nPlease find my proposed change in the PR.  It's work in progress and I'm happy to iterate if we agree on the the general direction.  I have seen a similar change on the 1.5.x branch, so I assume we can apply a similar change here.\r\n\r\nNo testing was done locally and I hope Travis will catch obvious problems.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-25T20:13:31Z","updated_at":"2019-07-08T19:01:00Z","closed_at":"2019-07-01T21:51:32Z","merged_at":"2019-07-01T21:51:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"e368ea24895b92f7e6b43fc0a51b3b0131193f12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1085340072,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDg1MzQwMDcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Java","name":"Java","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Label

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\n[numpy hsplit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.hsplit.html?highlight=hsplit#numpy.hsplit)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] implement Split an array into multiple sub-arrays horizontally (column-wise).\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- can't support indices_or_sections ==1 \r\n- indices must less than the shape of  ary[axis] \r\n\r\n@haojin2

to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge,

Description ##\r\nAdd operator arctan2 with its test code\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] To the my best

Description ##\r\nAdded python list and set as supported types for parameter 'indices_or_sections'\r\nAdded python frontend support for [numpy.vsplit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.vsplit.html)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added python list and set as supported types for parameter 'indices_or_sections'\r\n- [x] Added python frontend support for [numpy.vsplit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.vsplit.html)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Note: numpy.split and numpy.vsplit still does not support type ndarray for parameter 'indices_or_sections'.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-25T02:36:32Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T06:20:29Z","closed_at":"2019-08-23T06:20:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff0df172131808d7b4ac4fb8b8a051db2b8b8fbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15346/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15346/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15346/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f0d3eb6ef03185509bb39deb68c551968536d740","head":{"label":"zoeygxy:np_vsplit","ref":"np_vsplit","sha":"f0d3eb6ef03185509bb39deb68c551968536d740","user":{"login":"zoeygxy","id":33736316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzM2MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33736316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy","html_url":"https://github.com/zoeygxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192449299,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI0NDkyOTk=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"zoeygxy/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zoeygxy","id":33736316,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzM2MzE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33736316?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy","html_url":"https://github.com/zoeygxy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zoeygxy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zoeygxy/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nAdded the sub/mul operators to the MXnet -> ONNX conversion, for usage in the ONNX -> tensorRT conversion.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added ConvertElementwiseSub in nnvm_to_onnx-inl.h / nnvm_to_onnx.cc\r\n- [x] Added ConvertElementwiseMul in nnvm_to_onnx-inl.h / nnvm_to_onnx.cc\r\n- [x] Minor: fixed typo in CMakelists\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The implementation directly follows ConvertElementwiseAdd.\r\n- Fixes a bug since these missing operators were registered as TRTcompatible even before this commit.","created_at":"2019-06-24T23:16:14Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T08:21:58Z","closed_at":"2019-06-25T23:11:13Z","merged_at":"2019-06-25T23:11:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"51acd4d328c6da475c058806565d93bcddee7402","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"rahul003","id":3457240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NTcyNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3457240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003","html_url":"https://github.com/rahul003","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahul003/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15344/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/15344/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/15344/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/30601768f77c7530febb1031af8fab9edfb3ef46","head":{"label":"bermanmaxim:trtops","ref":"trtops","sha":"30601768f77c7530febb1031af8fab9edfb3ef46","user":{"login":"bermanmaxim","id":5989894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODk4OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5989894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim","html_url":"https://github.com/bermanmaxim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":193003813,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTMwMDM4MTM=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"bermanmaxim/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bermanmaxim","id":5989894,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5ODk4OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5989894?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim","html_url":"https://github.com/bermanmaxim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bermanmaxim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bermanmaxim/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR enables using TensorRT through cpp api\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ x ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ x ] All changes have test coverage: \r\n- [ x ] Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n     - I have updated the inference test but I don't think this is part of the ci task since I am not sure what is the easiest way to add this test in ci.\r\n- [ x ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [ x ]For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [ x ]For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ x ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ X ] inception_inference.cpp : update example for bind with TRT\r\n```\r\n./inception_inference --symbol

running inception_inference\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n  - This change is for enabling ability to use TensorRT integration through C++ API\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-23T18:32:38Z","updated_at":"2019-07-04T00:27:46Z","closed_at":"2019-07-04T00:27:45Z","merged_at":"2019-07-04T00:27:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"fc54781e08c3d20c184fdf108ee993d349542384","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n-  Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- add stack internal interface\r\n- add python interface\r\n- add unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-22T13:01:58Z","updated_at":"2019-08-11T17:42:56Z","closed_at":"2019-08-11T17:42:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4df8848b10a9d4443adfefbc0e39f7170dd90d51","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":

Description ##\r\nNumpy compatible dstack with existing kernel from concat\r\n[Numpy dstack](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dstack.html)\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes \r\n- Shape Inference added in src/operator/numpy/np_matrix_op.cc\r\n- Forward and Backward compute in src/operator/nn/concat-in.h\r\n- CPU and GPU registration in src/operator/numpy/np_matrix_op.cc and src/operator/numpy/np_matrix_op.cu\r\nPass CPU/GPU and lint tests.\r\n\r\n#### Test Case Covered\r\n- scalar tensor\r\n- zero size tensor\r\n- tensors with number of dimensions from 1 to 4\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\nThank @haojin2 for guidance and reviewing!","created_at":"2019-06-21T11:41:44Z","updated_at":"2019-08-13T07:36:55Z","closed_at":"2019-08-13T07:36:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ae05d64d6db44fea2f62baa7c9b92282bc3ab78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR has solved the problem of low efficiency to sample from the multinomial distribution, especially the distribution with a large number of possible outcomes. As it was described in #15231, it costs ~44 s using `mx.nd.random.multinomial`, while `np.random.multinomial` costs ~0.019 s. After our optimization, it decreases to ~0.054 s.\r\n\r\n## Feature changes ##\r\n### New features ###\r\n- Efficient sampling strategy for the multinomial distribution using binary search.\r\n- Use `double` type to define some cumulative variables for high precision with very small probabilities.\r\n- Reserve the CDF array for sampling many times without duplicated addition operations.\r\n\r\n### Performance ###\r\nWe compared the time costs of `mx.nd.random.multinomial` on branch master(b8b352d) and our PR shown in the table below. The result shows that the time cost of the original sampling strategy rises much more rapidly than that of our PR with the increasing number of outcomes.\r\n\r\n| Number of outcomes | Master(b8b352d) Costs (ms) | PR(6c3c49b) Costs (ms) |\r\n|-------------------:|---------------------------:|-----------------------:|\r\n|      10|       0.125                            | 0.066|\r\n|     100|       0.270                            | 0.058|\r\n|    1000|       0.729                            | 0.130|\r\n|   10000|       62.717                           |  0.996|\r\n|  100000|       5372.306                         | 12.125|\r\n| 1000000|    -                                   |173.534|\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n@pengzhao-intel @ciyongch @TaoLv Please help me refine this PR and have some review on it.

Description ##\r\nachive [numpy bitwise_xor](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.bitwise_xor.html) \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x ] Added  element-wise operator: bitwise_xor \r\n\r\n## Comments

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- Shape Inference added in src/operator/numpy/np_matrix_op.cc\r\n- Forward and Backward compute in src/operator/nn/concat-in.h\r\n- CPU and GPU registration in src/operator/numpy/np_matrix_op.cc and src/operator/numpy/np_matrix_op.cu\r\nPass CPU/GPU and lint tests.\r\n\r\n#### Test cases covered\r\n- 1-D tensors with 0-D tensors\r\n- zero size tensors\r\n- multidimensional tensors with different dimension sizes on the second axis\r\n## Comments ##\r\nScalar tensor can be hstacked with 1-D tensor similar to the behavior of numpy.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-21T03:05:53Z","updated_at":"2019-07-12T17:08:11Z","closed_at":"2019-07-12T17:08:11Z","merged_at":"2019-07-12T17:08:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"a26b2010183c5ad167c53d1c8e57d950959a3ac3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\n\r\nUtility to dump the computational graph, specially during backward for human consumption.\r\n\r\nDumps the graph to a dot file that can be rendered.\r\n\r\nThis is intended for developers, although if there's demand it can be exposed easily from python to get the graph from any variable if is_recording is true. It is done from C++ directly, no Python is required.\r\n\r\nAdded an environment variable which triggers the logic.\r\n\r\nIt should have no performance impact when it's not enabled as there's only one additional boolean check during backward, it access the environment only once.\r\n\r\n@apeforest @anirudh2290 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove

Description ##\r\nTutorial did not properly preprocess images and as such produce incorrect predictions. The example would set default values for mean but not for std_dev. So if the user does not provide the file that contains those values, the example would crash.

Description ##\r\nNumpy compatible argsort with existing kernals.\r\n[Numpy argsort API](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.argsort.html)\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nModify the `ArgSortShape` and `ArgSort` function in src/operator/tensor/ordering_op-inl.h to accommodate the following cases:\r\n#### Tensor types\r\n- [x] Scalor tensor \r\n- [x] Zero-size tensor\r\n- [x] Other tensor\r\n#### Axis types\r\n- [x] Default: -1, last axis is used\r\n- [x] None: flattened array is used\r\n- [x] Other integer in range `[0, input.ndim()-1]` or `[-input.ndim(), -1]`\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n(Please see appendix for experiment details)\r\n\r\nPR #14192  that enables dynamic shapes slows down a model that originally runs in 235.65 ms by 7.26 ms (to 242.91 ms).\r\n\r\nAlso noted that a seemingly relevant PR #14665 suggesting itself to be improving \"[performance]\", does not change performance number in any means - It still runs in 242.35 ms.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by caching the checking result of whether dynamic shape exists. The mechanism itself is quick simple: if the dynamic shape existence has been checked, let's simply don't do it again, because the graph does not change.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Changes ##\r\n- Added a new flag `dynamic_shape_checked` in CachedOp, which indicates whether dynamic shape existence has been checked.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nExperiment environment: EC2 p2.8xlarge, CUDA 10 and cuDNN 7.5. The model itself is confidential.\r\n\r\nThe detailed benchmark is as below (mean ± stdev). The experiment is conducted in 20 runs, warmup run is excluded. \r\n\r\n0) On commit 39412b37f (right before PR #14192 is merge):\r\nHybridize w/ static_alloc: 235.65 ± 0.22246 ms\r\n\r\n1) On commit 83d2c2d0e (where PR #14192 is merged):\r\nHybridize w/ static_alloc: 242.91 ms ± 0.71125 ms\r\n\r\n2) PR #14665 patched to commit 83d2c2d0e\r\nHybridize w/ static_alloc: 242.35 ± 0.25124 ms\r\n\r\n3) After this patch applied to commit 83d2c2d0e\r\nHybridize w/ static_alloc: 234.95 ± 0.39334 ms\r\n\r\nCC: @szha @zheng-da please review

Description ##\r\nNumpy-compatible version of trace with a new kernel\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] numpy-compatible trace operator on CPU and GPU\r\n- [x] unit tests on CPU\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- not tested on GPU\r\n\r\n@haojin2

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nFixes #15239 We were allowing non 2D NDArrays to be created as a CSR that caused inconsistencies and also caused a crash when one tried to access .data on a CSR Matrix. The crash was coming from here : https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/tensor/cast_storage-inl.h#L238.\r\nThe other places constructing CSRNDArray are already guarded by the shape checks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nPreviously it would be impossible to do `SymbolBlock.imports(...)` with non-fp32 parameters.\r\nThe problem was that the type inference would fail all the time and parameters types would default to fp32.\r\nNow we use the parameters type as provided in the parameter file, by casting the parameters to them (new `dtype_source` for the `load` `_load_init` and `load_parameters` functions to complement the `cast_dtype` flag)\r\nIf the parameters are not provided we attempt an automatic type inference with fp32 input.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease

Description ##\r\nMake MXNDArrayFromDLPack backward compatible, and add an additional Ex API.\r\nAdd backward compatibility tests.\r\n\r\n@junrushao1994 @roywei @szha \r\n\r\nThis will need to go in 1.5 branch.\r\n\r\nThanks to @frankfliu for pointing this.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-12T20:40:36Z","updated_at":"2019-06-13T03:06:14Z","closed_at":"2019-06-13T03:06:14Z","merged_at":"2019-06-13T03:06:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"a862270beb2d796c1ba311183f7f4a766a18ad6c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review
