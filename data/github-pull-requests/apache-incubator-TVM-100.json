is a pretty long discussion [thread](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/python-debugger-segfaults-with-tvm/843/9?u=junrushao1994).\r\n\r\nWe are finally able to narrow down the root cause: some pre-build libLLVM.so are usually linked with libedit.so (e.g. ones from apt-get); when libtvm.so is linked against libLLVM.so, the libedit.so conflicts with readline used in pdb/ipdb. This causes the entire program to crash.\r\n\r\nTwo workarounds:\r\n1) import readline before loading libtvm.so. (this PR)\r\n2) build TVM with static LLVM, so that unused linkage in libLLVM.so are ignored. ``set(USE_LLVM \"/path/to/llvm-config --ignore-libllvm\")``\r\n\r\nSome personal experience about pre-built LLVM: [clangdev](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/clangdev/files) and [llvmdev](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/llvmdev/files) from conda-forge works best with python, and have the most comprehensive versions. llvmdev is used to build llvmlite. which is used in numba JIT; clangdev comes with extra toolchain including clang, clang-format, etc.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconda install -c conda-forge clangdev=$VERSION\r\n```\r\n\r\nCC: @jwfromm @icemelon9 @gussmith23

The build times can be reproduced  with the script [here](https://github.com/dpankratz/TVMFuzz/blob/master/bugs/floormod/measure_build_times.py). This is due to the very complicated TIR expression generated when FloorMod or FloorDiv are lowered. \r\n\r\nI was able to improve upon this by changing how these operators were lowered to use the `tir.floor` intrinsic which also has the benefit of matching the [definitions of the operators](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/math-floormod-method-in-java/). \r\n\r\n## Topi testcase\r\n\r\nThere are existing tests for `tir.floormod` and `tir.floordiv` through the topi `test_topi_broadcast.py` file. However, I noticed that this files used `np.fmod` and `np.floor_divide` as points of reference which are not equivalent to `floormod` and `floordiv`.\r\n\r\nI fixed the testcase to use a correct version of `floormod` and `floordiv`.

improved the `Simplify` transformation to remove useless `IfThenElse` nodes. If the condition of a node can be proved true or false, the condition will be removed. For example, TVM often emit duplicated boundary guards like\r\n\r\n```cuda\r\nif (threadIdx.y * 100 + threadIdx.x < 1000) {\r\n  if (threadIdx.y * 100 + threadIdx.x < 1000) {\r\n    if (threadIdx.y *

PR uses the new Relay pattern language to simplify the `MergeComposite` pass implementation. Here are some highlights and discussions:\r\n\r\n- **After this PR, the patterns for composite functions must be rewritten.**\r\n- All patterns in the unit tests are rewritten to be DFPattern.\r\n- All unit tests are passed with the simplified implementation.\r\n- All unit tests include graph structure checking.\r\n- Add a new test case for a pattern with optional operators.\r\n- DNNL patterns are rewritten to be DFPattern.\r\n- The `MergeComposite` pass implementation becomes a simple wrapper to call `PartitionPattern`.\r\n\r\ncc @mbrookhart @mbaret @masahi @zhiics

debugmode.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-05-22T16:16:33Z","updated_at":"2020-07-20T15:53:08Z","closed_at":"2020-05-22T20:36:43Z","merged_at":"2020-05-22T20:36:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"896557d935999391dcc8bda001fb67d79e2f9ef8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c7ab54b2eb5eab5126c136a4d3a93720347263e2","head":{"label":"tqchen:const","ref":"const","sha":"c7ab54b2eb5eab5126c136a4d3a93720347263e2","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos

couple of patches to improve the debugging experience for µTVM:\r\n1. Make UTVMDone noreturn, so that the device doesn't jump to arbitrary code locations after stopping the debugger. This was causing it to often execute from peripheral memory and HardFault.\r\n\r\n2. Make debug mode extendable using a PackedFunc.

PR implements CoreML codegen using the BYOC feature and enables us to offload subgraphs to Apple’s Neural Engine on iOS devices.\r\n\r\n- The CoreML codegen is implemented with Python coremltools.\r\n- The `CoreMLRuntime` class is splitted into two classes, `CoreMLModel` and `CoreMLRuntime`, to support multiple models (subgraphs).\r\n- The CoreML runtime supports SaveToBinary and LoadFromBinary.  Compiled CoreML directories (mlmodelc) are serialized into a binary format with NSFileWrapper.\r\n- A mobilenet test is added to illustrate the usage of the CoreML codegen.  We can try it with [iOS TVM RPC](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/tree/master/apps/ios_rpc) workflow.\r\n\r\nRFC: https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-coreml-codegen/6415\r\n\r\n@tqchen @ZihengJiang

destined for external codegen keep their kCompiler attribute which means SkipFunction returns true when running a pass over them. This makes sense during graph partitioning, however when lowering the functions for codegen there is no reason to keep this behavior.\r\n\r\nRemoving this behavior will mean a codegen can run a pass on functions only intended for the 3rd party library - specifically, allowing pre-processing of a series of sub-graphs right before it is passes through codegen. This can help to ensure that the functions destined for the 3rd party library are in the expected format. For example, we may want to ensure that these functions have a kernel layout of OHWI because the 3rd party library only supports OHWI. This wouldn't be possible before partitioning the graph as we don't know how the graph will be partitioned ahead of time.\r\n\r\nChange-Id:

add bfloat16 as a new type named \"bf16\" in the frontend. Completed LLVM backend for generating bf16.\r\n\r\n * Use int16 as the storage type in LLVM\r\n * Add legalization to enable computations on bf16\r\n * Add runtime frontend support (e.g. allow converting numpy's uint16 array to bf16 NDArray)\r\n\r\n# Details on legalization\r\n\r\nSince most of the HW has no native support for computation on bf16, we added a pass `BF16Legalization` to use fp32 computing bf16 data. It adds `cast_to_fp32()` before each Op involing bf16 operands, and use Ops of fp32 to compute. Finally, it adds a 'cast_to_bf16()' after each Op that is altered. e.g.\r\n\r\n`add(a,b)` => `cast16(add(cast32(a), cast32(b)))`\r\n\r\nWe call this phase as \"BF16Promotion\". It is a sub-pass of `BF16Legalization` pass.\r\n\r\nWe note that this will add redundant casting. e.g.\r\n\r\n`add(a, neg(b))` => `cast16(add(cast32(a), cast32(cast16(neg(cast32(b))))) `\r\n\r\nThe pattern `cast32(cast16(some_fp32_value))` can be simplified to `some_fp32_value`.\r\n\r\nThus, we add an optimization pass after \"BF16Promotion\" in `BF16Legalization` pass, which eliminates redundant casts.\r\n\r\nAfter `BF16Legalization` pass, there will be no bf16 related computation in the AST, except casting between fp32 and bf16, bf16 value comparasion and assignment.\r\n\r\n# Casting between fp32 and bf16\r\n\r\nWe follow PyTorch's bf16 [casting](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/c10/util/BFloat16.h) implementation.\r\n

PR introduces the data structure `tvm:runtime::Array`, which replaces the original `tvm::Array`.\r\n\r\nRelated discussion: https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/discuss-runtime-array-containers-array-adt-string/4582.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Removes dependency to `std::vector`\r\n* The new array is POD-C compatible in terms of Itanium C++ ABI\r\n* Copy-on-write semantic is preserved in `Array`\r\n* `make_object` is specialized and overloaded to properly support creating `ArrayNode`\r\n* New features on `Array` that mimics `std::vector`, including `Array::insert`, `Array::erase`, `Array::resize`, `Array::reserve`, `Array::clear`, etc\r\n* This PR, in the meantime, also improves the stack usage, because we have identified the stack over-utilization problem, and patched dmlc-core during the development. Hopefully this would allow the recursive visitor pattern in TVM/Relay to deal with deeper neural networks :smile:. See [my post below](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/5585#issuecomment-631147088) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes\r\n* `ArrayNode` no longer has the field `std::vector data`\r\n* Read-only member access in `ArrayNode` is supported via `ArrayNode::at`, which comes with proper boundary checking\r\n*  Capacity change is no longer supported in `ArrayNode`\r\n*  In-place changing an item is supported via `ArrayNode::SetItem`, but it is never recommended even before this PR (because `ArrayNode` doesn't have copy-on-write semantic like `Array` does)\r\n*  Iterating through `ArrayNode` is supported with a raw constant pointer\r\n\r\n### Performance impact\r\n* We ran several end-to-end workloads, and didn't find any significant performance change\r\n* This shouldn't affect the size of `libtvm_runtime`, because the registration logic remains outside of `tvm::runtime`.\r\n\r\n### Future work\r\n* Move registration logic from `src/node` to `src/runtime`, and closely monitor the change of binary size\r\n* Refactor/Remove `IterAdaptor`, make it more correct, and add more features (e.g. -=)","created_at":"2020-05-13T06:50:45Z","updated_at":"2020-05-21T23:27:34Z","closed_at":"2020-05-21T23:27:15Z","merged_at":"2020-05-21T23:27:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"b4d4193aae7e2d15b0a0645b0b27736f08662a85","assignee":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

PR enables clang-format as a linter check stage.
