Change Logs\r\n\r\nJIRA: [HUDI-6079] Improve the code of HMSDDLExecutor, HiveQueryDDLExecutor.\r\n\r\n> Improve the log format of `hudi-hive-sync`.\r\n\r\nCase1:  Use non-standard logging.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nLOG.info(String.format(\"Time taken to getTableSchema: %s ms\", (end - start)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nLOG.info(\"Time taken to getTableSchema: {} ms.\", (end - start));\r\n```\r\n\r\nCase2:  Our logs have been changed to `slf4j`. \r\nThis log format recommends using placeholders to record logs\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nLOG.error(databaseName + \".\" + tableName + \" add partition failed\", e);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nLOG.error(\"{}.{} add partition failed.\", databaseName, tableName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nCase3:  Part of the log prints the `tableName` , and part of the log prints the `databaseName.tableName`\r\nuniformly modified to `databaseName.tableName`.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nHMSDDLExecutor#updateTableDefinition\r\nLOG.error(\"Failed to update table for \" + tableName, e);\r\n\r\nHMSDDLExecutor#addPartitionsToTable\r\nLOG.error(databaseName + \".\" + tableName + \" add partition failed\",

e);\r\n\r\nHMSDDLExecutor#addPartitionsToTable\r\nLOG.error(\"{}.{} add partition failed.\", databaseName, tableName);\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Remove redundant code\r\n3. Increase code readability\r\n \r\n> There are a lot of `append` when generating SQL, it is very difficult to read.\r\n\r\nCase1:\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString partitionsStr = String.join(\",\", partitionFields);\r\n    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\r\n    if (config.getBoolean(HIVE_CREATE_MANAGED_TABLE)) {\r\n      sb.append(\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \");\r\n    } else {\r\n      sb.append(\"CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS \");\r\n    }\r\n    sb.append(HIVE_ESCAPE_CHARACTER).append(config.getStringOrDefault(META_SYNC_DATABASE_NAME)).append(HIVE_ESCAPE_CHARACTER)\r\n            .append(\".\").append(HIVE_ESCAPE_CHARACTER).append(tableName).append(HIVE_ESCAPE_CHARACTER);\r\n    sb.append(\"( \").append(columns).append(\")\");\r\n    if (!config.getSplitStrings(META_SYNC_PARTITION_FIELDS).isEmpty()) {\r\n      sb.append(\" PARTITIONED BY (\").append(partitionsStr).append(\")\");\r\n    }\r\n    if (config.getString(HIVE_SYNC_BUCKET_SYNC_SPEC) != null) {\r\n      sb.append(' ' + config.getString(HIVE_SYNC_BUCKET_SYNC_SPEC) + ' ');\r\n    }\r\n    sb.append(\" ROW FORMAT SERDE '\").append(serdeClass).append(\"'\");\r\n    if (serdeProperties != null && !serdeProperties.isEmpty()) {\r\n      sb.append(\" WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (\").append(propertyToString(serdeProperties)).append(\")\");\r\n    }\r\n   .....\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n```\r\nafter:\r\nST command = new ST(CREATE_TABLE_TEMPLATE);\r\ncommand.add(DATABASE_NAME, dataBaseName);\r\ncommand.add(TABLE_NAME, tableName);\r\ncommand.add(EXTERNAL, getExternal(config));\r\ncommand.add(LIST_COLUMNS, getColumns(storageSchema, config));\r\nif (!config.getSplitStrings(META_SYNC_PARTITION_FIELDS).isEmpty()) {\r\n  command.add(PARTITIONS, getPartitions(storageSchema, config));\r\n}\r\ncommand.add(ROW_FORMAT, getRowFormat(serdeClass, serdeProperties,\r\n    inputFormatClass, outputFormatClass));\r\nif (config.getString(HIVE_SYNC_BUCKET_SYNC_SPEC) != null) {\r\n  command.add(BUCKETS, config.getBuckets());\r\n}\r\ncommand.add(LOCATION_BLOCK, getLocationBlock(config.getAbsoluteBasePath()));\r\ncommand.add(PROPERTIES, propertyToString(tableProperties));\r\nreturn command.render();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using field types, strings are used extensively. We have a type definition system that can be used directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`clustering.plan.strategy.target.file.max.bytes`'s unit is byte, `clustering.plan.strategy.small.file.limit` should be unified with it.  And they also compare sizes somewhere, there's not even a uniform unit here, like this\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  this.conf.setLong(FlinkOptions.CLUSTERING_PLAN_STRATEGY_SMALL_FILE_LIMIT.key(),\r\n      this.conf.getLong(FlinkOptions.CLUSTERING_PLAN_STRATEGY_TARGET_FILE_MAX_BYTES) > this.conf.getLong(FlinkOptions.CLUSTERING_PLAN_STRATEGY_SMALL_FILE_LIMIT)\r\n        ?

Change Logs\r\n\r\n1. Implement some basic `Expression`s for HUDI\r\n2. Try to convert all spark `Expression` to HUDI `Expression`\r\n3. Implement `PartialBindVisitor` and `BindVistor` to bind values to HUDI `Expression`\r\n4. Currently, we only support push down `EqualTo` Filters if it's the first level of partitions(by path prefix), this pr tries to pushdown more complex partition filters(Like `And`, `Or`, `EqualTo` etc) when fetching partitions. Through Parallel listing partition paths,  will use `PartialBindVisitor` to bind partitions which are listed, and change the unresolved references to `AlwaysTrue`.\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nGiven the table has 3 partition levels: year, month, day. And the existing table partition paths are:\r\nyear=2023/month=2/day=11\r\nyear=2023/month=2/day=12\r\nyear=2024/month=2/day=12\r\nIf we want to push down the filter `year=2023 AND day=12`, When listing the partition first level `year`, will bind schema `year` to `PartialBindVisitor`.\r\nSince `day` is not provided, the filter will be modified to `year=2023 AND TRUE`(optimized to `year=2023`), so the first 2 paths will be selected.\r\nThen starts to parallel listing first 2 paths, since the day is still not provided, these 2 paths still are selected.\r\nAnd finally listing the last partition level, the filter `year=2023 AND day=12` will be used and return `year=2023/month=2/day=12`\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of [discuss1](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8452#discussion_r1191971668) [discuss2](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8452#discussion_r1199997268), this feature would take effect if:\r\n1. For `FileSystemBackedTableMetadata`: `hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning` and `hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.urlencode` are both enabled\r\n2. For `HoodieTableBackedTableMetadata`(`hoodie.metadata.enable` is true): only `hoodie.datasource.write.hive_style_partitioning` is enabled\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\nNone, will fall back to old behavior if cannot be pushed down.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\nmedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nOriginal `ClusteringUtils::getOldestInstantToRetainForClustering` is based on inflight clean instant, but there maybe a moment when the last clean is complete and the next clean plan not generated, if timeline archive execute at this moment, no replace commit will be retained.  \r\nThis pr propose to decide OldestInstantToRetainForClustering based on latest completed clean instant, return the first replace commit after the `earliestInstantToRetain` of last complete clean or first replace commit after last clean instant if `earliestInstantToRetain` is empty, and return the first replace commit in active timeline if there is no clean instant.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`HoodieTableSource` supports the implementation of `SupportsFilterPushDown` interface that pushes down the `CallExpression` filter into `FileIndex`. `HoodieTableSource` should support parquet predicate push down to improve query performance, which evaluates `FilterPredicate` from `CallExpression` to push down `FilterPredicate` to `ParquetColumnarRowSplitReader`.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe impact is mainly query performance via parquet predicate push down.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nLooks like table services are not propoerly shut down when post write termination kicks in. This patch fixes the flow, and in regular ingestion, any table service will shut down correctly when it is terminated after enabling write and meets the conditions (including compaction/clustering).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves the usability of post write termination strategy for deltastreamer in continuous mode.\r\n\r\nAlso tested w/ a manual deltastremaer execution. w/o the fix, spark job just hangs, and w/ the fix, it shutsdown gracefully,including compaction/clustering.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf both archival and cleaner is based on num_commits, we do have some validations in place that archival should not be aggressive compared to cleaner. But if cleaner is based on hours, we don't have any such conditions. we need to add them to ensure archival does not clean up any commits which cleaner has not cleaned up yet. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdding guard rails to archival when cleaner is based on num hours policy. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe are adding [auto record key gen](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8107) mainly to cater to append only use-cases. So, as part of the work stream, this is a follow up patch. This patch makes bulk_insert as the default operation type for append only use-cases. For regular pipelines (immutable), \"upsert\" will be the default operation. \r\n\r\nThis is stacked on top of #8107. commit to review: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8389/commits/cf7b54b92491c7fe516b19097d58a7f04392497a\r\n\r\nWith this patch, users can now do the following w/ hudi. \r\n\r\n```\r\na. non-partitioned: df.write.format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").save(path) -> will use bulk_insert. \r\nb. partitioned dataset: df.write.partitionBy(colA).format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").save(path) -> will use bulk_insert. \r\nc. multi-field partitioning: df.write.partitionBy(colA, colB).format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").save(path)  -> will use bulk_insert. \r\n``` \r\n\r\nIf any of the config is set among (partition path, record key or partition path), default operation is chosen to be \"upsert\" which has been the behavior so far. \r\n\r\n```\r\ndf.write.partitionBy(colA).format(\"hudi\").\r\noption(\"hoodie.table.name\",\"hudi_tbl\").\r\noption(\"hoodie.datasource.write.precombine.field\",\"updated_at\").\r\nsave(path) -> will use upsert. \r\n```\r\n\r\nWe do have a limitation wrt MOR table still, since precombine is a mandatory field for MOR table. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGreatly improves the performance of hudi for append only use-cases. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNeed to update our hudi website w/ sufficient docs. \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the fallback mechanism in Hive and Glue catalog sync so that if the last commit time synced falls behind to be before the start of the active timeline of Hudi table, the sync gets all partition paths on storage and resolves the difference compared to what's in the metastore, instead of reading archived timeline which can be expensive in I/O.  The PR also enhances the tests to cover the new logic.\r\n\r\nNote that, the last commit time synced CAN fall behind, especially for Glue catalog, where `hoodie.datasource.meta_sync.condition.sync` is recommended to be set to `true` so that the last commit time synced is only updated upon partition changes, to limit the number of versions of data in Glue catalog.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAvoids loading archived timeline during Hive and Glue Sync.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNo documentation update needed.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n-

Change Logs\r\n\r\nLooks like when we fallback to full partition cleaning in clean planner, we do FS based listing even though metadata is enabled. It was added in https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5169 mainly due to how delete_partition was designed back then. Later delete_partition logic evolved and now we should be good to make this metadata based if applicable. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWill improve clean planning latency for large tables.\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFix remained ser/des concurrency conflicts when aysnc compaction/clustering enabled.\r\n\r\n#### 1.  fix conflicts caused by ```WatermarkStatus```\r\n\r\nConflicts will result from ```Watermark```, ```LatencyMarker``` and ```WatermarkStatus```, the community has fix other issues except ```WatermarkStatus```. We will fix it in this PR.\r\n    \r\nflink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/runtime/io/AbstractStreamTaskNetworkInput.java\r\n\r\n```\r\n    private void processElement(StreamElement recordOrMark, DataOutput<T> output) throws Exception {\r\n        if (recordOrMark.isRecord()) {\r\n            output.emitRecord(recordOrMark.asRecord());\r\n        } else if (recordOrMark.isWatermark()) {\r\n            statusWatermarkValve.inputWatermark(\r\n                    recordOrMark.asWatermark(), flattenedChannelIndices.get(lastChannel), output);\r\n        } else if (recordOrMark.isLatencyMarker()) {\r\n            output.emitLatencyMarker(recordOrMark.asLatencyMarker());\r\n        } else if (recordOrMark.isWatermarkStatus()) {\r\n            statusWatermarkValve.inputWatermarkStatus(\r\n                    recordOrMark.asWatermarkStatus(),\r\n                    flattenedChannelIndices.get(lastChannel),\r\n                    output);\r\n        } else {\r\n            throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Unknown type of StreamElement\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n####  2. Since the ```WatermarkStatus```  is introduced since Flink1.14, this PR will add ```SafeAsyncOutputAdapter``` in multi modules, to coordinate Flink1.13 and Flink1.14 above\r\n\r\nThe ```Output```  is actually the root cause of concurrency conflicts, so let's just refactor it but not the compact/cluster operator to minimize the impacts.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nfix bugs in multi Flink versions.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor the kafka source, when pulling data from kafka, the default parallelism is the number of kafka partitions.\r\nThere are cases: \r\n1. Pulling large amount of data from kafka (eg. maxEvents=100000000), but the # of kafka partition is not enough, the procedure of the pulling will cost too much of time\r\n2. There is huge data skew between kafka partitions, the procedure of the pulling will be blocked by the slowest partition\r\n\r\nto solve those cases, I add a parameter `hoodie.deltastreamer.source.kafka.minPartitions` to control the maxEvents in one kafka partition input, default 0 means not trun this feature on.\r\n\r\nHere is the comparison of this feature:\r\nmax executor core is 128.\r\nbefore: \r\n<img width=\"1370\" alt=\"image\"

cores).\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Default should be no impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_none._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- `hoodie.deltastreamer.source.kafka.minPartitions` the config controls the desired partitions when reading from kafka \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently hudi's savepoint only saves base file, and filter the files in it when clean. But when using the MOR table with INMEMORY(FLINK_STATE) index (which is default when using Flink), hudi's savepoint may be invalid, because there may no base file in a FG. \r\n\r\nIn addition, savepoint should save the logfiles, because the combination of the base file and the log files is a full snapshot at the savepoint’s instant time.\r\n\r\nIn this PR:\r\n- Add log files to savepoint metadata\r\n- Add `getAllLatestFileSlicesBeforeOrOn` in `SliceViewWithLatestSlice`\r\n- Add two test (will fail without this PR)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdd log files to savepoint metadata\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n1. Add a new method to `HoodieCLIUtils.scala` so that we could get HoodieCatalogTable which is not in the current session. `hoodie.properties` file only record table name with `hoodie.table.name` property, we will get error message like [HUDI-6004](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6004).\r\n\r\n3. Add some test cases for this change.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nexpand the ability  of `run_clustering`、`run_clean`、`run_compaction` procedures\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

This sort of duplicates will reside in the dataset and won't be reconciled unless manually dedup the table.\r\n\r\nThis patch ensure dedup happens within the indexing (tagging) phase.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nGlobal index has an extra dedup step for some records, which may slow down the whole process if a lot partition updates happen. In most scenarios, this is rare and perf impact is negligible.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- [ ] New config `hoodie.global.index.dedup.parallelism`\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-03-31T21:42:54Z","updated_at":"2023-05-29T12:03:56Z","closed_at":"2023-05-29T12:03:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"37e568895ba9caf234f12d55d24f8747a977cb26","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/8344/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/8344/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/8344/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/f021bc3227eea58d049420227564b9c98589534e","head":{"label":"xushiyan:HUDI-5968-fix-global-index-dup","ref":"HUDI-5968-fix-global-index-dup","sha":"f021bc3227eea58d049420227564b9c98589534e","user":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":217592800,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTc1OTI4MDA=","name":"hudi","full_name":"xushiyan/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan/hudi","description":"Upserts
