Today this is more complex than necessary. Even though the `df.observe()` API has been around in Spark since Spark 3.3, it's usage is not widespread.\r\n\r\nTo give users a more visible API for understanding the data flow execution in Spark, this patch adds a new method to the DataFrame API called `df.debug()`. Debug will by default do the following:\r\n\r\n  1. Create a new observation with the name `debug:<uuid>`\r\n  2. Add a `count(1)` observation to it\r\n  3. Capture the call stack and attach it to the observation.\r\n\r\nAfter the execution, users can now access the observation using the execution info property of the DataFrame.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndf = spark.range(100).debug()\r\ndf = df.filter(df.id < 10).debug()\r\ndf.collect()\r\nei = df.executionInfo\r\nfor o in ei.observations:\r\n    print(o.debugString())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe debug String contains the reference to the observation, the call site and the values.\r\n\r\n```\r\nObservation(name=debug:945125d7-2c0b-495c-a94b-3fdd56560b2f, planId=0, metrics=count_values=100, callSite=<ipython-input-1-df562d17bba7>:1@<module>)\r\nObservation(name=debug:d8a11a55-58ed-4b62-80ef-14a862c1f446, planId=2, metrics=count_values=10, callSite=<ipython-input-2-4a176498c5c4>:1@<module>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1200\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/3421/736e59b2-ae08-4c2b-862f-5f82b7d8f323\">\r\n\r\nIn addition to the count, we have defined several useful additional debug observations that can be easily injected.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.metrics import DataDebugOp\r\ndf = spark.range(100).debug(DataDebugOp.max_value(\"id\"))\r\ndf = df.filter(df.id < 10).debug(DataDebugOp.max_value(\"id\"))\r\ndf.collect()\r\nei = df.executionInfo\r\nfor o in ei.observations:\r\n     print(o.debugString())\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduces the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nObservation(name=debug:a682f617-ddde-45bc-8263-8c3220cf9887, planId=4, metrics=count_values=100, max_value_id=99, callSite=<ipython-input-7-a374a4f978f1>:2@<module>)\r\nObservation(name=debug:a82808b6-039e-406d-acc5-c9922be84893, planId=6, metrics=count_values=10, max_value_id=9,

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently the default behavior of `collect_list` and `collect_set` is to exclude null values. This means that these functions is not usable for some applications. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nOther SQL implementations of  `array_agg` for example postgres (https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/functions-aggregate.html) will include nulls by default. By allowing the user to control the behavior of how nulls should be treated we cover more use cases and make it easier to migrate from other SQL engines.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, adds a new parameter `ignoreNulls` that can be provided to `collect_list` and `collect_set`.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew and existing tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to make `IndexShuffleBlockResolver` have explicit constructors from Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough `IndexShuffleBlockResolver` is `private` and there is no contract to keep class constructor signatures, from Apache Spark 4.0.0, we had better reduce the following situations with the old libraries built against old Spark versions.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCause: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: 'void org.apache.spark.shuffle.IndexShuffleBlockResolver.<init>(org.apache.spark.SparkConf,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPrevious [PR1](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46665) and [PR2](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46665) introduced parser and interpreter changes for SQL Scripting. This PR is a follow-up to introduce the concept of labels for SQL Scripting language and proposes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Changes grammar to support labels at start and end of the compound statements.\r\n- Updates visitor functions for compound nodes in the syntax tree in AstBuilder to check if labels are present and valid.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found in [Jira item](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-48529) for this task and its parent (where the design doc is uploaded as well).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe intent is to add support for various SQL scripting concepts like loops, leave & iterate statements.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\nThis PR is among first PRs in series of PRs that will introduce changes to sql() API to add support for SQL scripting, but for now, the API remains unchanged.\r\nIn the future, the API will remain the same as well, but it will have new possibility to execute SQL scripts.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThere are tests for newly introduced parser changes:\r\n\r\nSqlScriptingParserSuite - unit tests for execution nodes.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-28T13:09:01Z","updated_at":"2024-07-11T03:12:25Z","closed_at":"2024-07-11T03:12:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f56e9c12de5202367c5419d11cb0aa8c2141b2f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/79bc852869f35f74b6c85f53b306c5ea3554f6cb","head":{"label":"miland-db:sql_batch_labels","ref":"sql_batch_labels","sha":"79bc852869f35f74b6c85f53b306c5ea3554f6cb","user":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":768539955,"node_id":"R_kgDOLc79Mw","name":"spark","full_name":"miland-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"miland-db","id":162123620,"node_id":"U_kgDOCanPZA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/162123620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db","html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/miland-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/miland-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the `pyspark.logger` module to facilitate structured client-side logging for PySpark users.\r\n\r\nThis module includes a `PySparkLogger` class that provides several methods for logging messages at different levels in a structured JSON format:\r\n- `PySparkLogger.info`\r\n- `PySparkLogger.warning`\r\n- `PySparkLogger.error`\r\n\r\nThe logger can be easily configured to write logs to either the console or a specified file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## DataFrame error log improvement\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves the DataFrame API error logs by leveraging this new logging framework:\r\n\r\n### **Before**\r\n\r\nWe introduced structured logging from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45729, but PySpark log is still hard to figure out in the current structured log, because it is hidden and mixed within bunch of complex JVM stacktraces and it's also not very Python-friendly:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"ts\":

we have to manually set up and customize the Python logging module, for example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"TestLogger\")\r\nuser = \"test_user\"\r\naction = \"test_action\"\r\nlogger.info(f\"User {user} takes an {action}\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis logs an information just in a following simple string:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINFO:TestLogger:User test_user takes an test_action\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not very actionable, and it is hard to analyze not since it is not well-structured.\r\n\r\nOr we can use Log4j from JVM which resulting in excessively detailed logs as described in the above example, and this way even cannot be applied to Spark Connect.\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\nWe can simply import and use `PySparkLogger` with minimal setup:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.logger import PySparkLogger\r\nlogger = PySparkLogger.getLogger(\"TestLogger\")\r\nuser = \"test_user\"\r\naction = \"test_action\"\r\nlogger.info(f\"User {user} takes an {action}\", user=user, action=action)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis logs an information in a following JSON format:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"ts\": \"2024-06-28 19:44:19,030\",\r\n  \"level\": \"WARNING\",\r\n  \"logger\": \"TestLogger\",\r\n  \"msg\": \"User test_user takes an test_action\",\r\n  \"context\": {\r\n    \"user\": \"test_user\",\r\n    \"action\": \"test_action\"\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** we can add as many keyword arguments as we want for each logging methods. These keyword arguments, such as `user` and `action` in the example, are included within the `\"context\"` field of the JSON log. This structure makes it easy to track and analyze the log.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the PySpark client-side logging is improved.\r\n\r\nAlso added user-facing documentation \"Logging in PySpark\":\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1395\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-16 at 5 40 41 PM\"

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse `CollationAwareUTF8String.lowerCaseCodePoints` logic to properly lowercase strings according to UTF8_LCASE collation, instead of relying on `UTF8String.toLowerCase()` method calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid correctness issues with respect to code-point logic in UTF8_LCASE (arising when Java to performs string lowercasing) and ensure consistent results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, collation aware string function implementations will now rely on `CollationAwareUTF8String` string lowercasing for UTF8_LCASE collation, instead of `UTF8String` logic (which resorts to Java's implementation).\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests, with some new cases in `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n6 expressions are affected by this change: `contains`, `instr`, `find_in_set`, `replace`, `locate`, `substr_index`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse our own invalid UTF-8 byte sequence replacement logic in UTF8String, before all `.toString()` method calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid relying on Java to perform invalid UTF-8 byte sequence replacement, and ensure consistent results.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, collation aware string function implementations will now rely on our own invalid UTF-8 string replacement implementation, instead of Java's.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests, with some changes in `UTF8StringSuite` and `CollationSupportSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

#46942 to 3.5\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen change log checkpointing is enabled, the lock of the **RocksDB** state store is acquired when uploading the snapshot inside maintenance tasks, which causes lock contention between query processing tasks and state maintenance thread. This PR fixes lock contention issue introduced by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/45724. \r\n\r\nThe changes include:\r\n1. Removing lock acquisition in `doMaintenance()`\r\n2. Adding a `copyFileMappings()` method to **RocksDBFileManager**,  and using this method to deep copy the file manager state, specifically the file mappings `versionToRocksDBFiles` and `localFilesToDfsFiles`,  in `load()`\r\n3. Capture the reference to the file mappings  in `commit()`.\r\n\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want to eliminate lock contention to decrease latency of streaming queries so lock acquisition inside maintenance tasks should be avoided. This can introduce race conditions between task and maintenance threads. By making a deep copy of `versionToRocksDBFiles` and `localFilesToDfsFiles` in **RocksDBFileManager**, we can ensure that the file manager state is not updated by task thread when background snapshot uploading tasks attempt to upload a snapshot.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore, aggregate queries containing a window function without a window specification (e.g. `PARTITION BY`) would return a non-descriptive internal error message: \r\n\r\n`org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.UnresolvedException: [INTERNAL_ERROR] Invalid call to exprId on unresolved object SQLSTATE: XX000`\r\n\r\nThis PR catches the user error early and returns a more accurate description of the issue:\r\n\r\n`Window specification is not defined in the WINDOW clause for <windowName>. For more information about WINDOW clauses, please refer to '<docroot>/sql-ref-syntax-qry-select-window.html'.`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change produces a more descriptive error message for window functions, improving the Spark user experience. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit test in `sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/AnalysisErrorSuite.scala`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nDisable writing collated types to data sources that don't support them. However, spark managed tables should still work as the schema is in HMS and not in the file itself.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nRight now, when users write a collated type directly to json, text, orc.. they will not see that collation when reading back.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded new UTs\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen resolving of default value being done in method resolveColumnDefaultInAssignmentValue, exception that should be thrown in case default value is not resolvable is created in any case (positive or negative outcome), but exception creation can be expensive (because reading error-classes file to get exception message) we should avoid it and create exception only when it is needed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPerf improvement (less file reads)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNo tests yet\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR uses `SortShuffleManager#taskIdMapsForShuffle` to track the migrated shuffle files on the destination executor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is a long-standing bug in decommission where the migrated shuffle files can't be cleaned up from the executor. Normally, the shuffle files are tracked by `taskIdMapsForShuffle` during the map task execution. Upon receiving the `RemoveShuffle(shuffleId)` request from driver, executor can clean up those shuffle files by searching `taskIdMapsForShuffle`. However, for the migrated shuffle files by decommission, they lose the track in the destination executor's  `taskIdMapsForShuffle` and can't be deleted as a result.\r\n\r\nNote this bug only affects shuffle removal on the executor. For shuffle removal on the external shuffle service (when `spark.shuffle.service.removeShuffle` enabled and the executor stores the shuffle files has gone), we don't rely on `taskIdMapsForShuffle` but using the specific shuffle block id to locate the shuffle file directly. So it won't be an issue there.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo. (Common users won't see the difference underlying.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdd unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-27T11:34:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T15:57:19Z","closed_at":"2024-06-27T15:57:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"197707b7ddffaebf53402fb353cebf2d86833714","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dbc4da4ea94904c763cd843d4ca99de7d441993f","head":{"label":"Ngone51:SPARK-46957-3.5","ref":"SPARK-46957-3.5","sha":"dbc4da4ea94904c763cd843d4ca99de7d441993f","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add `Origin` (from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46789) to `Relation.RelationCommon`\r\nThis is a revert of the revert.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo have the common protobuf message to keep the source code info.\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-  // TODO(SPARK-48639): Add origin like Expression.ExpressionCommon\r\n-\r\n-  // (Required) Shared relation metadata.\r\n-  string source_info = 1;\r\n+  // (Optional) Shared relation metadata.\r\n+  reserved 1;\r\n```\r\nThis is considered as a breaking change, and we should fix up all other branches down to avoid, which isn't really worthwhile.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is not used.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI should validate protobuf definition, and exiting tests should pass.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIntroducing virtual column family to RocksDB. We attach an 2-byte-Id prefix as column family identifier for each of the key row that is put into RocksDB. The encoding and decoding of the virtual column family prefix happens at the `RocksDBKeyEncoder` layer as we can pre-allocate extra 2 bytes and avoid additional memcpy.\r\n\r\n- Remove Physical Column Family related codes as this becomes potentially dead code till some caller starts using this.\r\n- Remove `useColumnFamilies` from `StateStoreChangelogV2` API.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently within  the scope of the arbitrary stateful API v2 (transformWithState)  project, each state variable is stored inside one [physical column family](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Column-Families) within the RocksDB state store instance. Column families are also used to implement secondary indexes for various features. Each physical column family has its own memtables, creates its own SST files, and handles  compaction independently on those independent SST files.\r\n\r\nWhen the number of operations to RocksDB is relatively small and the number of column families is relatively large, the overhead of handling small SST files becomes high, especially since all of these have to be uploaded in the snapshot dir and referenced in the metadata file for the uploaded RocksDB snapshot. Using prefix to manage different key spaces / virtual column family could reduce such overheads.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. If `useColumnFamilies` are set to true in the `StateStore.init()`, virtual column family will be used.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests in `RocksDBStateStoreSuite`, and integration tests in `TransformWithStateSuite`.\r\nMoved test suites in `RocksDBSuite` into `RocksDBStateStoreSuite` because some previous verification functions are now moved into `RocksDBStateProvider`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-26T21:15:00Z","updated_at":"2024-07-09T03:02:39Z","closed_at":"2024-07-09T03:02:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3eeba36a487aec2d7f78419eeaae521635284e25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUpdate `InitCap` Spark expressions to use ICU case mappings for UTF8_BINARY collation, instead of the currently used JVM case mappings. This behaviour is put under the `ICU_CASE_MAPPINGS_ENABLED` flag in SQLConf, which is true by default. Note: the same flag is used for `Lower` & `Upper` expressions, with changes introduced in: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47043.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo keep the consistency between collations - all collations shouls use ICU-based case mappings, including the UTF8_BINARY collation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the behaviour of `initcap` string function for UTF8_BINARY will now rely on ICU-based case mappings. However, by turning the `ICU_CASE_MAPPINGS_ENABLED` flag off, users can get the old JVM-based case mappings. Note that the difference between the two is really subtle.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests, with extended `CollationSupport` unit tests for InitCap to verify both ICU and JVM behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

UNSET TBLPROPERTIES ...` in v1 and v2.\r\n(this means that in the v1, regardless of whether `IF EXISTS` is specified or not, when unset a `non-existent` property, it is `ignored` and no longer `fails`.)\r\n- update the description of `ALTER TABLE ... UNSET TBLPROPERTIES ...` in the doc `docs/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-alter-table.md`.\r\n- unify v1 and v2 `ALTER TABLE ... UNSET TBLPROPERTIES ...` tests.\r\n- Add the following `scenario` for `ALTER TABLE ... SET TBLPROPERTIES ...` testing\r\nA.`table to alter does not exist`\r\nB.`alter table set reserved properties`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- align the command `ALTER TABLE ... UNSET TBLPROPERTIES ...` in v1 and v2, avoid confusing end-users.\r\n- to improve test coverage.\r\n- align with other similar tests, eg: `AlterTableSetTblProperties*`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, in the `v1`, regardless of whether `IF EXISTS` is specified or not, when unset a `non-existent` property, it is `ignored` and no longer `fails`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdate some UT & Pass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39218, there is a fix when python pinned thread mode is on, and `query.stop()` sends an interrupted signal, for example (from the original ticket):\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport time\r\n\r\ndef func(batch_df, batch_id):\r\n    time.sleep(10)\r\n    print(batch_df.count())\r\n\r\nq = spark.readStream.format(\"rate\").load().writeStream.foreachBatch(func).start()\r\ntime.sleep(5)\r\nq.stop()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause all python errors are wrapped inside `PY4JJavaError`, the fix was to do reg-ex match on that error string:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/94763438943e21ee8156a4f1a3facddbf8d45797/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamExecution.scala#L690-L692\r\n\r\nHowever, this regex only checks the case when the exception is thrown in `time.sleep(10)` (my understanding). So only errors like this would be captured:\r\n```\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o44.count.\r\n: java.lang.InterruptedException\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut say the interrupted signal is sent when executing a spark query:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef func(batch_df, batch_id):\r\n    batch_df.sparkSession.range(10000000).write.saveAsTable(\"oops\")\r\n    print(batch_df.count())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we would see such errors:\r\n```\r\npy4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError: An error occurred while calling o2141502.saveAsTable.  \r\n: org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted.  \r\n<REDACTED>\r\n<REDACTED>\r\n<REDACTED>\r\n...\r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StreamExecution$$anon$1.$anonfun$run$2(StreamExecution.scala:262)  \r\nat scala.runtime.java8.JFunction0$mcV$sp.apply(JFunction0$mcV$sp.java:23)  \r\nat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.StreamExecution$$anon$1.run(StreamExecution.scala:262)  \r\n*Caused by: java.lang.InterruptedException  \r\nat java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.doAcquireSharedInterruptibly(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:1000)*  \r\nat java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquireSharedInterruptibly(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:1308)  \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn such cases, query.stop() would actually cause the query to throw, although it shouldn't.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we propose to relax the regex and match more InterruptedException.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAs described in issue [SPARK-39901](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39901) the design of the current `ignoreCorruptFiles` feature has certain flaws. It excessively matches `IOException`s, which may cause a file to be Ignored by mistake when encountering some transient and sporadic IO exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a new config `spark.files.ignoreCorruptFiles.errorClasses`. By setting this config, Spark users can accurately ignore corrupt files caused by specific exceptions. \r\n\r\nFor example, if the config value is set as belows:\r\n\r\n-   `java.lang.IOException:not a Sequence file,java.lang.EOFException`\r\n(config format: className[:keyMsg],className[:keyMsg])\r\n\r\nIt means that when an `IOException` is encountered and the error message contains key information `not a Sequence file`, or when a `java.lang.EOFException` is encountered (note that only class needs to be judged here), corrupted files should be ignored.\r\n\r\nThe default value of this config is \"\", which means that the error class list for ignoring corrupt files has not been set. At this time, the behavior of `ignoreCorruptFiles` remains exactly the same as before.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nOptimize the defects of the current `ignoreCorruptFiles` feature.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, Spark users can change the behavior of `ignoreCorruptFiles` by setting the new config; but by default, the behavior remains the same as before. So don't worry it's a breakchange for users.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nAdd some new test cases and Pass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR aims to fix incorrect conf settings of `ignoreCorruptFiles` related tests case in `ParquetQuerySuite`. The inner `withSQLConf (SQLConf.IGNORE_CORRUPT_FILES.key -> \"false\")` will overwrite the outer configuration, making it impossible to test the situation where `sqlConf` is true.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix test coverage logic.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a index range check for `UnsafeRow.pointTo()` when `baseObject` is byte array.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAll the other places like `readExternal()`, `read()` ensures `sizeInBytes` can't be larger than the lenght of `baseObject` when it is a byte array excepet `pointTo()`. So adding this check helps us to get better error stack info in the first place when the index went wrong. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark 4.0 added a new `df.mergeInto` API, but it is missing from PySpark. This PR fixes that.\r\nThe support for this API in Spark Connect Python API will be added later by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46960.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBecause PySpark does not support `df.mergeInto`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, the user would be able to use the `df.mergeInto` API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'common/utils/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAlternative fix to the one suggested in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/47081\r\n\r\nBecause of the rule HandleNullInputsForUDF ScalaUDF will propagate null for primitive types. The problem is that this is currently not reflected in the implementation of `nullable` for ScalaUDF. This currently leads to wrong nullability of the result in some cases. This patch fixes this by making the implemenation of `nullable` for ScalaUDF reflect that it propages null for primitive types.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix nullability.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, fixes nullability.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew and existing tests.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo,\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR propose to improve concurrency performance for `FunctionRegistry`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, `SimpleFunctionRegistryBase` adopted the `mutable.Map` caching function infos. The `SimpleFunctionRegistryBase`  guarded by this so as ensure security under multithreading.\r\nBecause all the mutable state are related to `functionBuilders`, we can delegate security to `ConcurrentHashMap`.\r\n`ConcurrentHashMap ` has higher concurrency activity and responsiveness.\r\nAfter this change, `FunctionRegistry` have better perf than before.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nGA.\r\nThe benchmark test.\r\n```\r\nobject FunctionRegistryBenchmark extends BenchmarkBase {\r\n\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n * Replace NumPy types removed in NumPy 2.0 with their equivalent counterparts\r\n * Make tests compatible to new `__repr__` of numerical scalars\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPySpark references some code which was removed with NumPy 2.0:\r\n * `np.NaN` was removed, should be replaced with `np.nan`\r\n * `np.string_` was removed, [is an alias for](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.26.5/numpy/__init__.pyi#L3134) `np.bytes_`\r\n * `np.float_` was removed, [is defined the same as](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.26.5/numpy/__init__.pyi#L3042-3043) `np.double`\r\n  * `np.unicode_` was removed, [is an alias for](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/v1.26.5/numpy/__init__.pyi#L3148) `np.str_`\r\n\r\nNumPy 2.0 changed the `__repr__` of numerical scalars to contain type information (e.g. `np.int32(3)` instead of `3`). Old behavior can be enabled by setting `numpy.printoptions(legacy=\"1.25\")` (or the older `1.21` and `1.13` legacy modes). There are multiple tests and doctests that rely on the old behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests for modules `pyspark-connect`, `pyspark-core`, `pyspark-errors`, `pyspark-mllib`, `pyspark-pandas`, `pyspark-sql`, `pyspark-resource`, `pyspark-testing` were executed in a local venv with `numpy==2.0.0` installed.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-25T11:31:15Z","updated_at":"2024-07-29T23:01:32Z","closed_at":"2024-07-03T00:23:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ab45b5726d7f495d2bc2a60952bb28abaa38182","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

team, Lucas here from Databricks. We have seen some customers that while trying to change some HMS ORC/AVRO tables column name by using RENAME COLUMN they face an error: [UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.TABLE_OPERATION] The feature is not supported: Table `hive_metastore`.`schema`.`table` does not support RENAME COLUMN. Please check the current catalog and namespace to make sure the qualified table name is expected, and also check the catalog implementation which is configured by \"spark.sql.catalog\".

While looking into the current documentation it mentions that this is available for v2 tables but does not show what are v2 tables, it should be good for customers/users to understand what are these v2 tables.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes changes to count memory used by external cache in storage memory and include it in overall spill logic.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have a scenario that use Spark together with a 3rd party file source cache, which is an independent lib and has its internal logic for cache entry creation, eviction and remove. Currently we allocate dedicated memory for this cache but the problem is that the memory can't be shared along with Spark execution/storage memory. It will be more effective for memory usage if we can count it in the UnifiedMemoryManager and include it in memory spill logic.\r\n\r\nWe also have a requirement of memory management for a native RDD cache implementation. The existing interfaces in MemoryStore is generally bound with Spark SerializerManager and BlockEvictionHandler. It's not easy to extend for such customized RDD cache.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. It introduces some configurations for memory management: `spark.memory.external.cache.enabled`, `spark.memory.external.storageFraction` and `spark.memory.storage.preferEvictExtCache`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIt's tested by tpcds workload with external file source cache.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe `StaticInvoke` class is used extensively by `RuntimeReplacable` expressions, due to its ugly string representation, a plan with multiple or nested `StaticInvoke` is hard to read.\r\n\r\nThis PR overrides `StaticInvoke`'s toString method to improve its readability. \r\n\r\n```diff\r\n Project [left(c7#x, 2) AS left(c7, 2)#x, left(c8#x, 2) AS left(c8, 2)#x, left(v#x, 3) AS left(v, 3)#x, left(s#x, 2) AS left(s, 2)#x]\r\n +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.char_tbl4\r\n-   +- Project [staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.CharVarcharCodegenUtils, StringType, readSidePadding, c7#x, 7, tru\r\ne, false, true) AS c7#x, staticinvoke(class org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.util.CharVarcharCodegenUtils, StringType, readSidePadding, c8#\r\nx, 8, true, false, true) AS c8#x, v#x, s#x]\r\n+   +- Project [static_invoke(CharVarcharCodegenUtils.readSidePadding(c7#x, 7)) AS c7#x, static_invoke(CharVarcharCodegenUtils.readSideP\r\nadding(c8#x, 8)) AS c8#x, v#x, s#x]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the `Invoke`'s toString is overly simple, losing its child's string representations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nimprove plan readability and consistency \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, a plan containing `StaticInvoke` will change its string representation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

 ### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is the final planned SPJ scenario:  auto-shuffle one side + less join keys than partition keys.  Background:\r\n\r\n- Auto-shuffle works by creating ShuffleExchange for the non-partitioned side, with a clone of the partitioned side's KeyGroupedPartitioning.\r\n- \"Less join key than partition key\" works by 'projecting' all partition values by join keys (ie, keeping only partition columns that are join columns).  It makes a target KeyGroupedShuffleSpec with 'projected' partition values, and then pushes this down to BatchScanExec.  The BatchScanExec then 'groups' its projected partition value (except in the skew case but that's a different story..).\r\n\r\nThis combination is hard because the SPJ planning calls is spread in several places in this scenario.  Given two sides, a non-partitioned side and a partitioned side, and the join keys are only a subset:\r\n\r\n1.  EnsureRequirements creates the target KeyGroupedShuffleSpec from the join's required distribution (ie, using only the join keys, not all partition keys).\r\n2.  EnsureRequirements copies this to the non-partitoned side's KeyGroupedPartition (for the auto-shuffle case)\r\n3.  BatchScanExec groups the partitions (for the partitioned side), including by join keys (if they differ from partition keys).\r\n\r\nTake the example partition columns (id, name) , and partition values: (1, \"bob\"), (2, \"alice\"), (2, \"sam\").\r\nProjection leaves us (1, 2, 2), and the final grouped partition values are (1, 2).\r\n\r\nThe problem is, that the two sides of the join do not match at all times.  After the steps 1 and 2, the partitioned side has the 'projected' partition values (1, 2, 2), and the non-partitioned side creates a matching KeyGroupedPartitioning (1, 2, 2) for ShuffleExechange.  But on step 3, the BatchScanExec for partitioned side groups the partitions to become (1, 2), but the non-partitioned side does not group and still retains (1, 2, 2) partitions.  This leads to following assert error from the join:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequirement failed: PartitioningCollection requires all of its partitionings have the same numPartitions.\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: requirement failed: PartitioningCollection requires all of its partitionings have the same numPartitions.\r\n\tat scala.Predef$.require(Predef.scala:337)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.plans.physical.PartitioningCollection.<init>(partitioning.scala:550)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.joins.ShuffledJoin.outputPartitioning(ShuffledJoin.scala:49)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.joins.ShuffledJoin.outputPartitioning$(ShuffledJoin.scala:47)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.joins.SortMergeJoinExec.outputPartitioning(SortMergeJoinExec.scala:39)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.EnsureRequirements.$anonfun$ensureDistributionAndOrdering$1(EnsureRequirements.scala:66)\r\n\tat scala.collection.immutable.Vector1.map(Vector.scala:2140)\r\n\tat scala.collection.immutable.Vector1.map(Vector.scala:385)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.EnsureRequirements.org$apache$spark$sql$execution$exchange$EnsureRequirements$$ensureDistributionAndOrdering(EnsureRequirements.scala:65)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.EnsureRequirements$$anonfun$1.applyOrElse(EnsureRequirements.scala:657)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.exchange.EnsureRequirements$$anonfun$1.applyOrElse(EnsureRequirements.scala:632)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix is to do the de-duplication in first pass.  \r\n\r\n1. Pushing down join keys to the BatchScanExec to return a de-duped outputPartitioning (partitioned side)\r\n2. Creating the non-partitioned side's KeyGroupedPartitioning with de-duped partition keys (non-partitioned side).\r\n\r\n\r\n  ### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is the last planned scenario for SPJ not yet supported.\r\n\r\n  ### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdate existing unit test in KeyGroupedPartitionSuite\r\n\r\n  ### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the new `to_avro` and `from_avro` SQL functions added in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/46977 to return reasonable errors when Avro is not loaded by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAccording to the [Apache Spark Avro Data Source Guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-avro.html), Avro is not loaded into Spark by default. With this change, users get reasonable error messages if they try to call the `to_avro` or `from_avro` SQL functions in this case with instructions telling them what to do, rather than obscure Java `ClassNotFoundException`s.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds golden file based test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo GitHub copilot this time.","created_at":"2024-06-21T23:51:10Z","updated_at":"2024-06-23T23:25:19Z","closed_at":"2024-06-23T23:25:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa46ad182dff88d96864deb39b0bc719893f0ec3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47063/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47063/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47063/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84ac6fb1fbe79a7d7667264808b9976ea4d811b6","head":{"label":"dtenedor:to-from-avro-error-not-loaded","ref":"to-from-avro-error-not-loaded","sha":"84ac6fb1fbe79a7d7667264808b9976ea4d811b6","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR implements multiple performance optimizations for `ParserUtils.unescapeSQLString`:\r\n\r\n1. Don't use regex: following https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31362, the existing code uses regexes for parsing escaped character patterns. However, in the worst case (the expected common case of \"no escaping needed\") it will perform four regex match attempts per input character, resulting in significant garbage creation because the matchers aren't reused.\r\n2. Skip the StringBuilder allocation for raw strings and for strings that don't need any unescaping.\r\n3. Minor: use Java StringBuilder instead of the Scala version: this removes a layer of indirection and may benefit JIT (we've seen positive results in some scenarios from this type of switch).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nunescapeSQLString showed up as a CPU and allocation hotspot in certain testing scenarios. See this flamegraph for an illustration of the relative costs of repeated regex matching in the old code:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/50748/e045d9da-da0f-493c-a634-188acaeab1a9)\r\n\r\nThe new code is almost arbitrarily faster (e.g. can show ~arbitrary relative speedups, depending on the choice of input) for strings that don't require unescaping. For strings that _do_ need escaping, I tested extreme cases where _every_ character needs escaping: in these cases I see ~10-20x speedups (depending on the type of escaping). The new code should be faster in every scenario.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCorrectness is covered by existing unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2024-06-21T23:03:36Z","updated_at":"2024-06-25T09:13:10Z","closed_at":"2024-06-25T09:13:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b6b9ab7498012e021f401d1b684f8905471e64c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/47062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/47062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/07f0ed7516a152ab8d8aeaa1869deda25c7c7f04","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:unescapeSQLString-optimizations","ref":"unescapeSQLString-optimizations","sha":"07f0ed7516a152ab8d8aeaa1869deda25c7c7f04","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds AES-GCM as an optional AES cipher mode for RPC encryption. The current default is using AES-CTR without any authentication. That would allow someone on the network to easily modify RPC contents on the wire and impact Spark behavior. See [SPARK-47172](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47172) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current default is using AES-CTR without any authentication. That would allow someone on the network to easily modify RPC contents on the wire and impact Spark behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds an additional configuration flag is reflected in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests are all ensured to pass. New unit tests are written to explicitly test GCM support and to verify that modifying ciphertext content will cause an exception and fail.\r\n\r\n`build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change adds AES-GCM as an optional AES cipher mode for RPC encryption. The current default is using AES-CTR without any authentication. That would allow someone on the network to easily modify RPC contents on the wire and impact Spark behavior. See [SPARK-47172](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-47172) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current default is using AES-CTR without any authentication. That would allow someone on the network to easily modify RPC contents on the wire and impact Spark behavior.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds an additional configuration flag is reflected in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests are all ensured to pass. New unit tests are written to explicitly test GCM support and to verify that modifying ciphertext content will cause an exception and fail.\r\n\r\n`build/sbt

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdding a new classes of filters which are collation aware.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n#46760 Added the logic of predicate widening for collated column references, but this would completely change the filters and if the original expression did not get evaluated by spark later we could end up with wrong results. Also, data sources would never be able to actually support these filters and they would just see them as AlwaysTrue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current `schema_of_variant` depends on `JsonInferSchema.compatibleType` to find the common type of two types. This function doesn't handle the case of `float x decimal` or `decimal x float` correctly. It doesn't produce the expected result, but consider the two types as incompatible and produces `variant`. This change doesn't affect the JSON schema inference because it never produces `float` beforehand.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is a bug fix and is required to process floats correctly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new unit test that checks all type combinations.\r\n\r\n### Was this
