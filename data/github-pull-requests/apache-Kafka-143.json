for the lock in ConsumerNetworkClient can lead to a livelock situation in which an active commitSync is unable to make progress because its completion is blocked in the heartbeat thread. The fix is twofold:\r\n\r\n1) We change ConsumerNetworkClient to use a fair lock to reduce the chance of each thread getting starved.\r\n2) We eliminate the dependence on the lock in ConsumerNetworkClient for callback completion so that callbacks will not be blocked by an active poll().\r\n\r\nI've left this as a WIP patch since I am still considering test cases.\r\n\r\n###

patch reverts the removal of the --execute option in the offset reset tool and the change to the default behavior when no options were present. These changes were introduced in KIP-171, but they are not compatible with previous releases. We should at least give users a deprecation window for incompatible changes.\r\n\r\nTest cases were not actually validating that offsets were committed when the --execute option was present, so I have fixed that and added basic assertions for the dry-run behavior. I also removed some duplicated test boilerplate.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

This should be backported to the `1.1` branch, and is currently a blocker for 1.1.**\r\n\r\nThe `connect_test.py::ConnectStandaloneFileTest.test_file_source_and_sink` system test is failing with the SASL configuration without a sufficient explanation. During the test, the Connect worker fails to start, but the Connect log contains no useful information. There are actual several things compounding to cause the failure and make it difficult to understand the problem.\r\n\r\nFirst, the `tests/kafkatest/tests/connect/templates/connect_standalone.properties` is only adding in the broker's security configuration with the `producer.` and `consumer.` prefixes, but is not adding them with no prefix. The worker uses the AdminClient to connect to the broker to get the Kafka cluster ID and to manage the three internal topics, and the AdminClient is configured via top-level properties. Because the SASL test requires the clients all connect using SASL, the lack of broker security configs means the AdminClient was attempting and failing to connect to the broker. This is corrected by adding the broker's security configuration to the Connect worker configuration file at the top-level. (This was already being done in the `connect_distributed.properties` file.)\r\n\r\nSecond, the default `request.timeout.ms` for the AdminClient (and the other clients) is 120 seconds, so the AdminClient was retrying for 120 seconds before it would give up and thrown an error. However, the test was only waiting for 60 seconds before determining that the service failed to start. This can be corrected by setting `request.timeout.ms=10000` in the Connect distributed and standalone worker configurations.\r\n\r\nThird, the Connect workers were recently changed to lookup the Kafka cluster ID before it started the herder. This is unlike the older uses of the AdminClient to find and manage the internal topics, where failure to connect was not necessarily logged correctly but nevertheless still skipped over, relying upon broker auto-topic creation to create the internal topics. (This may be why the test did not fail prior to the recent change to always require a successful AdminClient connection.) Although the worker never got this far in its startup process, the fact that we missed such an error since the prior releases means that failure to connect with the AdminClient was not being properly reported.\r\n\r\nThe `ConnectStandaloneFileTest.test_file_source_and_sink` system tests were run locally prior to this fix, and they failed as with the nightlies. Once these fixes were made, the locally run system tests passed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

patch fixes a bug in the validation of the inter-broker protocol and the message format version. We should allow the configured message format api version to be greater than the inter-broker protocol api version as long as the actual message format versions are equal. For example, if the message format version is set to 1.0, it is fine for the inter-broker protocol version to be 0.11.0 because they both use message format v2.\r\n\r\nI have added a unit test which checks compatibility for all combinations of the message format version and the inter-broker protocol version.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

the visibility of the aclMatch function in the SimpleAclAuthorizer class is set to private, thus prohibiting subclasses from overriding this method. I think this was originally done as this function is not supposed to be part of the public Api of this class, which makes sense.\r\nHowever when creating a custom authorizer this would be a very useful method to override, as it allows to reuse a large amount of boilerplate code around loading and applying ACLs and simply changing the way that ACLs are matched.\r\n\r\nBy changing the visibility to _protected_ we allow subclasses to override

a Produce request contains multiple record sets for a single topic-partition, it is better to iterate these before calling Log.append. This is because append will process all the sets together, and therefore will need to reassign offsets even if the offsets for an individual record set are properly formed. By iterating the record sets before calling append, each set can be considered on its own and potentially be appended without reassigning offsets.\r\n\r\n3 tests added to cover this:\r\n- Append a single MemoryRecords that contains multiple batches\r\n- Append a single MemoryRecords that contains no batches\r\n- Append a single MemoryRecords that has an empty batch in the middle of valid batches\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

to this patch, the consumer always blocks in poll() if there are any partitions which are awaiting their initial positions. This behavior was inconsistent with normal fetch behavior since we allow fetching on available partitions even if one or more of the assigned partitions becomes unavailable _after_ initial offset lookup. With this patch, the consumer will do offset resets asynchronously, which allows other partitions to make progress even if the initial positions for some partitions cannot be found.\r\n\r\nI have added several new unit tests in `FetcherTest` and `KafkaConsumerTest` to verify the new behavior. One minor compatibility implication worth mentioning is apparent from the change I made in `DynamicBrokerReconfigurationTest`. Previously it was possible to assume that all partitions had a fetch position after `poll()` completed with a non-empty assignment. This assumption is no longer generally true, but you can force the positions to be updated using the `position()` API which still blocks indefinitely until a position is available.\r\n\r\nNote that this this patch also removes the logic to cache committed offsets in `SubscriptionState` since it was no longer needed (the consumer's `committed()` API always does an offset lookup anyway). In addition to avoiding the complexity of maintaining the cache, this avoids wasteful offset lookups to refresh the cache when `commitAsync()` is used.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

acquires `initializationLock#writeLock` to establish a new connection while processing session expiry WatchEvent. `ZooKeeperClient#handleRequests` acquires  `initializationLock#readLock`, allowing multiple batches of requests to be processed concurrently, but preventing reconnections while processing requests. At the moment, `handleRequests` holds onto the readLock throughout the method, even while waiting for responses and inflight requests to complete. But responses cannot be delivered if event thread is blocked on the writeLock to process session expiry event. This results in a deadlock. During broker shutdown, the shutdown thread is also blocked since it needs the readLock to perform `ZooKeeperClient#unregisterStateChangeHandler`, which cannot be acquired if a session expiry had occurred earlier since this thread gets queued behind the event handler thread waiting for writeLock.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by limiting locking in `ZooKeeperClient#handleRequests` to just the non-blocking send, so that session expiry handling doesn't get blocked.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

fix is in two folds:\r\n\r\n1) For tasks that's closed in `closeZombieTask`, their corresponding partitions are still in `runningByPartition` so those closed tasks may still be returned in `activeTasks` and `standbyTasks`. Adding guards on the returned tasks and if they are closed notify the thread to trigger rebalance immediately.\r\n\r\n2) When triggering a rebalance, un-subscribe and re-subscribe immediately to make sure we are not dependent on the background heartbeat thread timing.\r\n\r\n3) Some minor changes on log4j. More specifically, I moved the log entry of `closeZombieTask` to its callers with more context information and the action going to take.\r\n\r\nI can re-produce the issue with EosIntegrationTest may hand-code the heartbeat thread to GC, and confirmed this patch fixed the issue. Unfortunately this test cannot be added to AK since currently we do not have ways to manipulate the heartbeat thread in unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade
