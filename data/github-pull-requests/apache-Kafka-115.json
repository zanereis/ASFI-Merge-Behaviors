onLeavePrepare we would look into the assignment and try to revoke the owned tasks and notify users via RebalanceListener#onPartitionsRevoked, and then clear the assignment.\r\n\r\nHowever, the subscription's assignment is already cleared in this.subscriptions.unsubscribe(); which means user's rebalance listener would never be triggered. In other words, from consumer client's pov nothing is owned after unsubscribe, but from the user caller's pov the partitions are not revoked yet. For callers like Kafka Streams which rely on the rebalance listener to maintain their internal state, this leads to inconsistent state management and failure cases.\r\n\r\nBefore KIP-429 this issue is hidden away since every time the consumer re-joins the group later, it would still revoke everything anyways regardless of the passed-in parameters of the rebalance listener; with KIP-429 this is easier to reproduce now.\r\n\r\nOur fixes are following:\r\n\r\n• Inside `unsubscribe`, first do `onLeavePrepare / maybeLeaveGroup` and then `subscription.unsubscribe`. This we we are guaranteed that the streams' tasks are all closed as revoked by then.\r\n• [Optimization] If the generation is reset due to fatal error from join / hb response etc, then we know that all partitions are lost, and we should not trigger `onPartitionRevoked`, but instead just `onPartitionsLost` inside `onLeavePrepare`. This is because we don't want to commit for lost tracks during rebalance which is doomed to fail as we don't have any generation info.\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

PR adds a Replica Fetcher benchmark for use in improving the performance and CPU usage of the ReplicaFetcher. In this initial PR I chose to only address one minor performance issue - unnecessary gettimeofday calls in steady state (when partitions are not delayed). I realize there are ways to improve the performance of gettimeofday calls, but it does require action on the part of the user, so I believe this optimization is still worthwhile. I have further performance optimizations that I will address in future PRs once the benchmark has been added.\r\n\r\nBenchmarked on r5.xlarge:\r\n```\r\nBefore:\r\nBenchmark

probing is currently broken when the leader is chosen from one of the new (already upgraded) instances, as older members will blindly upgrade to a version they don't support (then throw an exception) while newer members will receive an assignment with the older version and trigger a new rebalance (leading to rebalance loop if the older members can't upgrade their subscription) because we always send assignments encoded using the min version seen by any client--see ticket for details.\r\n\r\nNote that a real \"version probing\" rebalance is technically one where the leader is old and receives subscriptions it can't understand. In this case we send an assignment back with the old version, which the receiving consumer then knows to downgrade to and trigger another rebalance. \r\n\r\nWhen you have a \"new\" leader however, I propose we:\r\n\r\n- always send assignments back using the same version as the corresponding subscription, EXCEPT if we notice that everyone now supports the latest version but some are still using the older version. this signals the rolling upgrade is complete, so send everyone back the latest version\r\n- if you receive a version greater than the one you sent, it must mean the bounce is over and it is safe to now send new versions. upgrade your subscription version and trigger a final rebalance. this will actually only happen when the leader is the last to be bounced\r\n- if the leader is new, it can understand all subscriptions so we just wait for everyone to be bounced and allow new members to keep sending new version subscriptions. once the last member is upgraded everyone will already be using the new subscription and we don't need to trigger a second and final rebalance.\r\n- if you receive a version less than what you sent, this is version probing so downgrade your subscription and trigger another rebalance -- this will now only happen when you are actually on a higher version than the leader, so we know this is true version

request/response classes have code to serialize/deserialize directly to\r\n`ByteBuffer` so the intermediate conversion to `Struct` can be skipped for them.\r\nWe have recently completed the transition to generated request/response classes,\r\nso we can also remove the `Struct` based fallbacks.\r\n\r\nAdditional noteworthy changes:\r\n* `AbstractRequest.parseRequest` has a more efficient computation of request size that\r\nrelies on the received buffer instead of the parsed `Struct`.\r\n* Use `SendBuilder` for `AbstractRequest/Response` `toSend`, made the superclass\r\nimplementation final and removed the overrides that are no longer necessary.\r\n* Removed request/response constructors that assume latest version as they are unsafe\r\noutside of tests.\r\n* Removed redundant version fields in requests/responses.\r\n* Removed unnecessary work in `OffsetFetchResponse`'s constructor when version >= 2.\r\n* Made `AbstractResponse.throttleTimeMs()` abstract.\r\n* Using `toSend` in `SaslClientAuthenticator` instead of `serialize`.\r\n* Various changes in Request/Response classes to make them more consistent and to\r\nrely on the Data classes as much as possible when it comes to their state.\r\n* Remove the version argument from `AbstractResponse.toString`.\r\n* Fix `getErrorResponse` for `ProduceRequest` and `DescribeClientQuotasRequest` to\r\nuse `ApiError` which processes the error message sent back to the clients. This was\r\nuncovered by an accidental fix to a `RequestResponseTest` test (it was calling\r\n`AbstractResponse.toString` instead of `AbstractResponse.toString(short)`).\r\n\r\nRely on existing

PR implements changes proposed in [KIP-495](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-495%3A+Dynamically+Adjust+Log+Levels+in+Connect).\r\n\r\nThis change will introduce an `/admin/loggers` endpoint to the Connect worker that can be used to get/modify the log levels of any named logger in the Connect worker.\r\n\r\nThe following new configs are introduced: \r\n\r\n* `admin.listeners` to control where the admin endpoint will be made available. The default value should bring the `/admin` endpoint along with the existing endpoints. Setting it to empty disables the /admin endpoint altogether. Any other host:port string create that listener and only bring the admin endpoints on it.\r\n* The `admin.listeners.https.` prefix is used to find SSL props for any HTTPS endpoints. \r\n\r\nMultiple tests are added to verify adding admin endpoints with various listeners, and to check if the REST endpoints behave as intended. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-27T07:00:53Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T06:17:31Z","closed_at":"2019-10-02T22:00:38Z","merged_at":"2019-10-02T22:00:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c831c22e13fcc59e7e1a9e6c28fd38048eb3f62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7403/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7403/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7403/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/346b075cb061a4cf9ec25e3b0336f69e9ffcdc7d","head":{"label":"wicknicks:KAFKA-7772-2","ref":"KAFKA-7772-2","sha":"346b075cb061a4cf9ec25e3b0336f69e9ffcdc7d","user":{"login":"wicknicks","id":85652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks","html_url":"https://github.com/wicknicks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":110271231,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTAyNzEyMzE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"wicknicks/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wicknicks","id":85652,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1NjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/85652?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks","html_url":"https://github.com/wicknicks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wicknicks/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wicknicks/kafka","description":"Mirror

Jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8945)\r\n[KAFKA-8947 JIra ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8947)\r\n\r\nThe changes here are simple:\r\n• KAFKA-8945: a few checks to ensure that constructor parameters in the `AbstractState` and `ConnectorHealth` classes are non-null and non-empty are fixed. The current logic erroneously ensures that they are either null or empty.\r\n• KAFKA-8947: a bug in how the Connect framework instantiates `TaskState` objects for use by REST extensions (specifically, incorrect order in arguments provided to a constructor) is fixed. The current logic, while erroneous, should never have arisen in the past by REST extension developers, as it would have been covered by KAFKA-8945.\r\n\r\nThe `RestExtensionIntegrationTest` is expanded on to test these changes in the wild, verifying that they work and preventing any future regressions.\r\n\r\nThis fix should be backported through to 2.0, when Connect REST extensions were initially introduced.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-09-25T23:56:50Z","updated_at":"2020-10-16T06:17:31Z","closed_at":"2019-10-15T22:27:26Z","merged_at":"2019-10-15T22:27:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"bcdc6336fc4346f384a742ca88aeb188bd97cb38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/890474f41df79152557e41308183103491841906","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-8945","ref":"kafka-8945","sha":"890474f41df79152557e41308183103491841906","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

change is the client-side part of KIP-360. It identifies cases where it is safe to abort a transaction, bump the producer epoch, and allow the application to continue without closing the producer. In these cases, when KafkaProducer.abortTransaction() is called, the producer actually sends an InitProducerId request, which causes the ongoing transaction to be aborted and the producer epoch to be bumped. The application can then start a new transaction and continue processing.\r\n\r\nFor recoverable errors in the idempotent producer, the epoch is bumped locally. In-flight requests for partitions with an error are rewritten to reflect the new epoch, and in-flights of all other partitions are allowed to complete using the old epoch. \r\n\r\n### Committer

described in KIP-360, this patch changes producer state retention so that prodcuer state remains cached even after it is removed from the log. Producer state will only be removed now when the trasnactional id expiration time has passed. This is intended to reduce the incidence of UNKNOWN_PRODUCER_ID errors for producers when records are deleted or when a topic has a short retention time. Tested with unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

It is probably best to just ignore them.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n-

Add reassignment metrics (KIP-352)\r\n\r\nKIP-352 aims to add several new metrics in order to track reassignments much better. We will be able to measure bytes in/out rate and the count of partitions under active reassignment.\r\nWe also change the semantic of the UnderReplicatedPartitions metric to cater better for reassignment. Currently it reports under-replicated partitions when during reassignment extra partitions are added as part of the process but this PR changes it so it'll always take the original replica set into account when computing the URP metrics.\r\n\r\nThe newly added metrics will be: \r\n- kafka.server:type=ReplicaManager,name=ReassigningPartitions\r\n- kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=ReassignmentBytesOutPerSec\r\n- kafka.server:type=BrokerTopicMetrics,name=ReassignmentBytesInPerSec\r\n\r\nThe changed URP metric:\r\n-

UpdateMetadata{Request, Response}, LeaderAndIsr{Request, Response}\r\nand StopReplica{Request, Response} with the automated protocol classes.\r\n\r\nUpdated the JSON schema for the 3 request types to be more consistent and\r\nless strict (if needed to avoid duplication).\r\n\r\nThe general approach is to avoid generating new collections in the request\r\nclasses. Normalization happens in the constructor to make this possible. Builders\r\nstill have to group by topic to maintain the external ungrouped view.\r\n\r\nIntroduced new tests for LeaderAndIsrRequest and UpdateMetadataRequest to\r\nverify that the new logic is correct.\r\n\r\nA few other clean-ups/fixes in code that was touched due to these changes:\r\n* KAFKA-8956: Refactor DelayedCreatePartitions#updateWaiting to avoid modifying\r\ncollection in foreach.\r\n* Avoid unnecessary allocation for state change trace logging if trace logging is not enabled\r\n* Use `toBuffer` instead of `toList`, `toIndexedSeq` or `toSeq` as it generally performs\r\nbetter and it matches the performance characteristics of `java.util.ArrayList`. This is\r\nparticularly important when passing such instances to Java code.\r\n* Minor refactoring for clarity and readability.\r\n* Removed usage of deprecated `/:`, unused imports and unnecessary

topic deletion, there exists a window where a broker updates\r\nits metadata cache to remove a deleted topic's partitions, and the\r\ncontroller removing the topic's znode. Consequently, it was possible\r\nfor a broker to believe a topic no longer existed, however it couldn't\r\nbe re-created due to outstanding ZK metadata.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to return a transient error for when this condition is\r\nencountered. Given the window is anticipated to be small, a retry\r\nwill eventually resolve the issue.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in rare cases, there existed a window where it was\r\npossible to re-create a topic's znode before its deletion process\r\nwas fully complete. This is fixed by making topic creation account\r\nfor any outstanding topic deletion znode.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation
