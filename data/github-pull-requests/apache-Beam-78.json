Convenience feature: flag to skip building/pushing Docker images\r\n\r\nIt sometimes desired that we skip a time- and resource-consuming step of building and pushing Docker images for backend and frontend apps\r\nFor example, if we did it once, we may want to keep and use the existing images in Artifact Repository, not build them again\r\n\r\nTo skip the step, we introduce a flag:\r\n```\r\n$ ./gradlew playground:terraform:deployBackend -Pproject_environment=\"testing\" -Pdocker-tag=\"testing\"\r\n# ~12Gb sized images built and uploaded\r\n\r\n# do changes in the infrastructure\r\n\r\n$ ./gradlew playground:terraform:deployBackend -Pproject_environment=\"testing\" -Pdocker-tag=\"testing\" -Pskip-push\r\n\r\n# this time it doesn't repeat the image build/push step\r\n```\r\nOf course, you'll have to care about the relevance of your images\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

order to embed Playground into Tour of Beam, reusable code must be extracted from Playground into a shared package.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Extracts a lot of code into `playground_components` package.\r\n- Adds `easy_localization` to Playground to localize strings related to the shared package. In the future, the entire Playground will be migrated to `easy_localization` for consistency.\r\n- Converts `enum SDK` to `class Sdk` so that the frontend may receive examples in a language it is not aware of. This is not a complete feature yet. In the future, we may allow such code to be shown but not be runnable. This is useful because in Beam docs there are now occasional TypeScript snippets for which we do not have a runner (although they are on the website only and not in the DB). With a closed enum, we would not be able to show such snippets at all becasue the embedded playground cannot be combined with ordinary HTML snippets under a signle set of tabs.\r\n- Renames `PlaygroundState` to `PlaygroundController`. Traditionally such change notifiers are called controllers in Flutter, e.g. `TextEditingController`, `TabController`, `ScrollController`, etc.\r\n- Renames `ExamplesState` to `ExampleCache` to limit its responsibility which is not defined now. In addition to caching catalog examples, it still performs non-cached calls like getting an example by path (for which we can introduce caching later), but it has functionality even more alien than that which will be removed soon.\r\n- Introduces a theme extension to store the app's colors and styles which is new to Flutter 3. Drops separate classes and inherited widgets that were used for this before.\r\n- Introduces `ExampleBase` and `Example` instead of a single `ExampleModel` class. Before there was no distinction between a codeless example pre-fetched in a list and a fully fetched example, and example's code had to be inspected to tell one from another. The two new classes allow for compile-time check that example code and other full info is fetched. The new classes are also immutable for even more safety.\r\n- Has some other renamings that improve clarity.\r\n- Adds the tour screen into Tour of Beam app with an embedded Playground.\r\n- Removes all generated mocks from version control. They are now generated at deployment and must be manually generated for local runs.\r\n- Adds `playground:frontend:playground_components` Gradle projects with `precommit` as the most notable task. Updates `playgound:frontend:precommit` and friends to account for the new package.\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses on establishing a more or less stable interface between the two apps and the shared package. It blocks all work on the entire frontend due to its scale, so with any local issues we still prefer this merged to work on them later separately.\r\n\r\nI carefully did `git mv` when moving files, but it turned out that it is insufficient for git to recognize renaming (it happens to only compare file contents anyway), and many moved files appear deleted and added. If it is a problem for the review, please tell me so, and I will make a proper branch, although it might take a day or so.\r\n\r\nI guess the only guaranteed way is to:\r\n1. Move a file.\r\n2. Commit.\r\n3. Edit the file.\r\n4. Commit again.\r\n\r\nNext time I will do it the right way.\r\n\r\nThis work aggregates the Tour of Beam screen and the Playground refactoring in a single PR because this was the fastest workflow that allowed us to avoid waiting for merges.

fixes #23213\r\n\r\nThis refactors AvroSource to use the standard DataFileReader from Avro.

the latest versions of the EduTools plugin, the previous katas stopped working, and this made it impossible to release new versions of the katas (e.g. after a new Beam release).\r\n\r\nThe main change is in the testing method. EduTools now uses Python's `unittest` for checking the exercises. So this pull request changes the test for all the katas (the test cases are the same, the format of the tests is the one expected by EduTools).\r\n\r\nI have also re-organized some of the katas (e.g. windowing and triggers are now under the Streaming category), and updated the katas to Beam 2.41.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master
