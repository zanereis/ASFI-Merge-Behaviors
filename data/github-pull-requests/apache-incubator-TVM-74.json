However, it broke the Vulkan+Windows builds, which expected symbols due to the `__declspec(dllexport)` defintion of `TVM_DLL` on MSVC (see #8805).

this commit is used to add calibration and tensorrt int8 mode in the original src/runtime/contrib/tensorrt (thanks for @trevor-m help). Currently, I tested several models including mobilenet_v2 and resnet34, and all of them have greater performance gain. Here is my GitHub gist for testing trt int8 result: https://gist.github.com/tiandiao123/67adb11ab3d73df8e83a1469707d7db4\r\n\r\nFirstly, users need to provide calibration data to do calibration, then use the following command line to run your program:\r\n```\r\nTVM_TENSORRT_USE_INT8=1 TENSORRT_NUM_CALI_INT8=10 python test_trt.py\r\n```\r\n, where TVM_TENSORRT_USE_INT8 denotes whether to use trt int8, and TENSORRT_NUM_CALI_INT8 denotes how many times we need to do data calibration (we'll do 10-times data calibration in the example). \r\n\r\nHere are some testing results (based on T4 machine, and TRT 7):\r\n```\r\n                                   INT8 TRT                    FP16 TRT\r\nresnet18                    0.38039684295654297 ms             0.5254888534545898 ms\r\nsuper_resolution            0.2799248695373535 ms              0.44 ms\r\n```\r\nresnet18 python testing script: https://gist.github.com/tiandiao123/c535b62918677d0a7c45fc005a44f27d\r\nsuper_resolution testing script: https://gist.github.com/tiandiao123/de52ef96f574645c2dccb3544b291487\r\n\r\nAlso, in my script, I used a single image for calibrating data for 10-times (just for demonstration). In real project, we should use authors' own data to do calibration. \r\n\r\nAlso, I used this test file (https://github.com/tiandiao123/tvm/blob/pr_trt_int8/tests/python/contrib/test_tensorrt_int8_exp.py) to test trt int8 precision result with respect to different kinds of resnet. I tested several cosine distances between outputs of the original torch models and the corresponding trt int8 tvm ouputs. I think all of them are under expectation since their similarities are greater than 0.99. The calibration results really depend on which models we choose, and what kind of sample data we choose to do calibration, and how many times do we need to do calibrations. In my experience, the number of calibration times also impact final calibration results. We need to make sure the calibration data is from actual models' training data or evaluation data, otherwise the cosine difference will be impacted. @jcf94 \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n                      cosine distance\r\nresnet34             0.005518794059753418\r\nresnet18             0.005487024784088135\r\nresnet50             0.002280294895172119\r\n```\r\nI also used the python script above to test densenet161 and mobilenet_v2, and both of them's cosine distance around 0.02~0.03. Since my image used is based on tutorial (https://tvm.apache.org/docs/tutorials/frontend/from_pytorch.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-frontend-from-pytorch-py), and the sample image is actually from resnet evaluation data, probably we need to use actual sample data belonging to densenet161 and mobilenet_v2 to get actual cosine distance, but overall the results are under expectation.

this PR, I introduce a pass-version of LowerTE called LowerTEPass. I also introduce two utility functions , IRModuleToLoweredModule and LoweredModuleToIRModule. These functions convert between IRModule and LoweredModule and preserve all information during the conversion.\r\n\r\nI also replaced some calls to LowerTE with an application of LowerTEPass. I used the conversion functions to make this change as minimal as possible.\r\n\r\nFor context, this work is the first step in removing LoweredModule from the codebase. We will convert sections of the code to use IRModule instead of LoweredModule, and push the conversion functions further down the stack. Eventually, we will be able to delete the LoweredModule and the conversion functions.\r\n\r\n@mbs-octoml @michalpiszczek @jroesch @tkonolige Please take a

mentioned in https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/8182, `TranposedConv2d` is an important operator in GAN related applications and `groups` should also be supported for this operator.  This PR was set to implement this missing feature. \r\n\r\nHowever, there are parts I am still confusing\r\n\r\n* Which names should be used for the topi function? \r\n  In topi.nn.conv2d, there are `data, kernel, strides, padding, out_dtype, output_padding` as well as `Input, Filter, strides, padding, out_dtype, output_padding`, which one should be used for newly added function?\r\n* Should we add a new function, or extend existing ones? \r\n  In most DL frameoworks (e.g., PyTorch), `conv2d` is a unified function with support of various arguments such as padding, dilation, groups. But in `topi`, `conv2d` (w/o groups) and `group_conv2d` are two differnet function. While I understand this might be important to backward compability, I would recommend to merge these functions for simplicty.\r\n\r\nPlease comment if you have any thoughts.

This PR switches the graph, VM and AOT executors to use the merged\r\ndevice_planner.cc from #9038, thus finally removing DeviceMap from the LowerTE Pass.\r\n\r\n- We retire analysis/context_analysis.cc and\r\n  transforms/device_annotation.cc (and their tests). That\r\n  includes the CollectDeviceInfo, CollectDeviceAnnotationOps and\r\n  ContextAnalysis entry points. These are all subsumed by the\r\n  PlanDevices pass and the device aware visitors.\r\n- The following passes now use the new 'Device Aware' visitors to\r\n  recover the device for every Relay sub-expression:\r\n     - backend/aot_executor_codegen.cc (AOTOnDemandAllocator)\r\n     - backend/graph_plan_memory.cc (StorageAllocaBaseVisitor etc)\r\n     - backend/te_compiler.cc (LowerTensorExprMutator)\r\n     - transforms/memory_alloc.cc (DialectRewriter)\r\n     - backend/vm/compiler.cc (VMFunctionCompiler)\r\n- The following passes/utils must maintain the device information\r\n  encoded by the device planner within \"on_device\" annotations and\r\n  \"param_device_types\"/\"result_device_type\" function attributes:\r\n     - backend/vm/lambda_lift.cc (LambdaLifter)\r\n     - transforms/to_a_normal_form.cc (Fill)\r\n     - ir/expr_functior.cc (Bind)\r\n- Remove a lot ad-hoc 'homogeneous' vs 'hetrogeneous' conditionals\r\n  in favor of just asking for the device. Also removed a lot of ad-doc\r\n  encodings of the 'default' device.\r\n- We no longer need to run device-planning twice (before and after\r\n  lowering). Device planning is also decoupled from memory planning.\r\n- The LowerTE Pass no longer needs an expression-to-device side table\r\n  (which was the problem which kicked this series of PRs off in the

commit is to move in the direction of including Vulkan tests in the CI.  No vulkan tests are enabled yet, since [the CI's config.cmake](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/main/tests/scripts/task_config_build_gpu.sh#L26) does not enable vulkan.\r\n\r\n- The environment variable NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES must include \"graphics\" in order to expose Vulkan drivers to the container.  This is added both to Dockerfile.ci_gpu for future image builds, and to docker/bash.sh for compatibility with current images.\r\n\r\n- The configuration files needed by the vulkan launcher and glvnd must be exposed to the container.  These are only included in  `docker/bash.sh`, as they may vary by host and so cannot be baked into the image.","created_at":"2021-08-18T13:50:31Z","updated_at":"2021-08-20T03:02:38Z","closed_at":"2021-08-20T01:33:43Z","merged_at":"2021-08-20T01:33:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"36ea17a0d15ce44fdd5d758de2717d75eac4a97e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"areusch","id":532957,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjk1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/532957?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch","html_url":"https://github.com/areusch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/areusch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jroesch","id":696509,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjUwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/696509?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch","html_url":"https://github.com/jroesch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jroesch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"leandron","id":437416,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzQxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/437416?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron","html_url":"https://github.com/leandron","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leandron/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8784/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/8784/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/8784/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/80cc0d9e28deb6131eab83c021b11c5343344c9d","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:docker_expose_vulkan_drivers","ref":"docker_expose_vulkan_drivers","sha":"80cc0d9e28deb6131eab83c021b11c5343344c9d","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/

cell was unified and implemented in common.py. It is used by pytorch and ONNX frontend of TVM. Critical fix was done on ONNX GRU implementation side. Performance tests for different modification of GRU before and after new implementation were carried out. Onnxruntime device is “CPU”. Desktop AMD Ryzen 5 3600 6-Core Processor is used. TVM target is “llvm -mcpu=k6”. The results are collected in the table:\r\n\r\nTable 1. Average time per run (microsec) for 10000 runs. The following parameters are used (small input size): with biases = True, batch first = True, linear before reset = True, feature size = 5, hidden size = 10, number of stacked layers = 2, sequence length = 3, batch size = 1, trials number = 100.\r\n\r\n| Frontend name/GRU type  |   uni  |    b    |     s     |    sb    | \r\n| :-----------------------------| :-----:|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|\r\n|Onnx                                    | 23.3  | 48.6   | 46.4   | 100.8   |\r\n|Onnx dev                             | 19.0  | 39.2   | 36.0   |  79.8   |\r\n|Onnx tuned                          |  3.44 | 4.93   |   5.4   |  9.21   |\r\n|Onnx dev tuned                   |  2.9   | 4.1     |  4.42   |  7.48   |\r\n|Pytorch dev                          |  9.49  | 16.17 | 18.87 |  33.3   |\r\n|Pytorch dev tuned               |  2.74  | 3.93   | 3.99   | 6.61   |\r\n|Onnxruntime                       | 13.06  | 16.89 | 19.2  |  25.9   |\r\n\r\nSuffix \"dev\" means implementation in this patch. There are several GRU types: uni – unidirectional, b – bidirectional, s – stacked (2 layers are used in the tests), sb - stacked bidirectional. Compiled by TVM pytorch GRU is faster than tuned ONNX GRU and onnxruntime! Tuned pytorch is strongly quicker. \r\n\r\nLowlights:\r\n1. using of TVM target “llvm -mcpu=core-avx2” for test machine led to issues related to accuracy after tuning and worse performance.\r\n2. Onnx GRU has issues related wrong implementation but unit test checks accuracy and does not catch it. Need more detail investigation, potentially it can be big problem for other ops.\r\n\r\n@masahi please

increase the TVM accessibility for PyTorch users, we add PyTorchTVM module to support the following workflow:\r\n1. convert a torchscript module to tvm graph\r\n2. build and tune tvm graph\r\n3. export well-tuned tvm graph as a pytorch op\r\n4. torch jit trace the tvm pytorch op with other pytorch modules, then save/load/serve as normal pytorch model\r\n\r\nThe example usage is here:

an issue with #8504 where the `arduino-cli` tool wanted to live in `~/.arduino15` but was being copied somewhere else. This change explicitly sets where Arduino's `downloads`, `data`, and `user` folders will live, and explicitly sets their permissions. We currently only use the `data` directory (for installing the `due` and `nano33ble` packages), but if we ever use the library manager in the future, we will need `user` and `downloads`.\r\n\r\nI've included below a full test log created from running `./docker/bash.sh tvm.ci_qemu:latest ./tests/scripts/task_python_microtvm.sh` on a branch with the changes from #8766 AND #8708.

PR is part of some work I am doing to remove LoweredModule. We need to have attributes on the IRModules as well as on BaseFuncs to be able to remove it. Adding DictAttrs to IRModule required refactoring some of the attribute utility functions. \r\n\r\nPreviously, GetAttr and HasNonzerAttr were members of BaseFunc. I moved them to be members of DictAttr so that they can also be used for the DictAttr in the IRModule. Finally, I changed WithAttrs so that it can also work for IRModules.\r\n\r\ncc @jroesch @mbs-octoml @tkonolige @michalpiszczek

base-box-tool 'test' command will skip destroying the test VM\r\nif a single provider is specified (i.e. --provider virtualbox) even if\r\nall release tests pass. This is confusing (no warning is displayed to\r\nthe user) and that will leave host resources (like USB devices necessary\r\nto run the test) locked by the VM. So if the user tries to use the same\r\nUSB device the program using the device (e.g. openocd) will cryptically\r\nfail.\r\n\r\nMoreoever, even if all tests pass and more than one provider is\r\nspecified but the option '--skip-build' is set a VM will be left running\r\nwithout notice.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes that behavior by:\r\n\r\n1. Always destroying the VM if the release test pass\r\n2. Always keeping the VM up and running if a test fails\r\n\r\n1. guarantees no resource remains locked by the VM without necessity. A\r\nnew flag '--skip-destroy' is introduced in case the user still wants to\r\nkeep a VM up and running if the release test pass. 2. guarantees the VM\r\nwhere the test failed is left running for further inspection of the test\r\nthat failed.\r\n\r\nFinally, for both 1. and 2. cases a proper message is displayed to the\r\nuser to inform if a VM was left running or not and about what actions\r\nthe user can take next accordingly to the test result in the VM.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

base-box-tool.py 'build' command will fail with a 'packer'\r\nerror message on the second run if it's run twice and the box for a\r\nprovider built on the first run is not removed manually before the\r\nsecond run.\r\n\r\nThis commit avoids that failure by checking for the existence of a box\r\nfor each specified provider and if a box already exists it will refuse\r\nto overwrite the box (since building a box takes a quite amount of time\r\nto be done), exiting and warning the user. A new option '--force' is\r\nadded to the 'build' command that allows the user to explicitly rebuild\r\nthe box in case one already exists.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Gustavo Romero <gustavo.romero@linaro.org>\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

reorganization or renaming of tutorials could cause documentation tests to fail in CI.  The CI checks out the version to be tested, which may still have generated documents in `docs/tutorials` and `docs/vta/tutorials`.  If a PR moves these to different folders, then they show up as duplicate `*.rst` files, resulting in sphinx warnings.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes a `docs/_staging` folder in which sphinx is run.

PR adds code to sanitize the names of input tensors (by replacing special characters with underscores) before using them in the header file generated by the  generate_c_interface_header() function. In particular, this is necessary because using the Tensorflow API to create models can result in input names containing colons e.g. `serving_default_x:0_int8` . Using these tensor names directly as variable names, results in invalid C code.\r\n\r\n@Mousius @manupa-arm @areusch
