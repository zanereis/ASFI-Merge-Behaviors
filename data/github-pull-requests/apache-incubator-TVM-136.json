wrap TVM compiled function as an NDArray function.

The hard part is that we need to use MXNet's engine to run the compiled function, instead of running them directly.\r\n\r\nSince TVM relies on LLVM, it is a bit too early to directly introduce this dependency. This PR does this differently. The TVM bridge depends on a header only component of TVM and does not have to link against tvm runtime.\r\n\r\nWhen a user has TVM installed in their environment, TVM queries the MXTVMBridge function to get the wrapper logic and use it to run MXNet's function asynchronously. When a user does not have TVM installed, the additional logic won't add any additional link dependencies.\r\n\r\nBecause of this optional linking logic, I did not include test case for MXNet's CI. But have verified that the code works locally on GPU and CPU case [here]( https://github.com/tqchen/tvm/blob/c1151420ac1376e2f4502564d8da5108089ae37d/tests/python/contrib/test_mxnet_bridge.py)\r\n\r\n## Restriction\r\nMXNet and TVM need to be built with same C++ ABI (because we pass around PackedFunc). This is somewhat a restriction but makes the code sharing easier by using the PackedFunc system. This usually can be achieved by using the same c++ compiler. For example, (g++4.8 and g++5.0 are not compatible, usually, the latest version of clang is compatible with latest version of g++), running incompatible ABI will cause undefined behavior in the code and possible segfault. This restriction can be possibly removed by forcing a pure C ABI, but requires additional work and may also affect the conciseness of code.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-25T05:17:28Z","updated_at":"2018-02-25T19:45:46Z","closed_at":"2018-02-25T19:45:46Z","merged_at":"2018-02-25T19:45:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"30eaf463e34d7c301357c31a010945d11df16537","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/930/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/930/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/930/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/c1151420ac1376e2f4502564d8da5108089ae37d","head":{"label":"tqchen:master","ref":"master","sha":"c1151420ac1376e2f4502564d8da5108089ae37d","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/t

is a step towards implementing NNVM issue https://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/issues/343\r\n\r\nThis PR sets up a C++ registry to back the target.generic_func mechanism in Python, which allows C++ to also register target-specialized functions (schedules and ops) in a Python compatible way. This mechanism provides compatibility in both directions: C++ can call functions registered in Python and vice versa. Python code can also override any function registered via C++ if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the case of C++ calling Python, a target string is provided which is parsed and entered on the python side. In the case of Python calling C++, the global current target object is stringified and passed to the registered function as an extra first argument.","created_at":"2018-02-11T19:10:23Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T11:37:26Z","closed_at":"2018-03-19T07:17:26Z","merged_at":"2018-03-19T07:17:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"4afc2f9bcb30e3f744ad6a7653bf295a42b50dcc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

changed PR title. Previous title was: \"Add functions to serialize/deserialize BuildConfig to a string in python and C++\"\r\n\r\nBoth the python BuildConfig and C++ BuildConfig can be serialized to a string and parsed back from a string. Tests are added for both.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis pertains to NNVM issue https://github.com/dmlc/nnvm/issues/343\r\nI have implemented, but not yet committed a C++ implementation of NNVM's build_module.py. The only place where this is not compatible with python is in the PackedFuncs `nnvm.compiler.lower` `nnvm.compiler.build_target`, called by the GraphFuseCompile pass. These rely on the global instance of BuildConfig set previously by python. In order to make the C++ implementation compatible with python, they need to be able to share BuildConfigs, and avoid accessing the global instance. This PR allows them to be serialized to a string and treated in a similar way to target strings. The stringified BuildConfig can then be passed to the PackedFuncs via graph attributes, or some other

a data member to the Stage class so that a Stage object knows what Schedule object it belongs to.\r\nTo do autotensorize (see #695), we need to check tensorization conditions at the time Python's tensorize() is called. To do that we first need to make a copy of the schedule and normalize it (in Stage::autotensorize()). To do this, a Stage object needs to know what Schedule object it belongs to. Finally, we check those conditions on the copied schedule and stage objects.\r\nI have made quite a few changes for autotensorize but to keep it more organized and make it easier to understand and review, I'm going to submit them in pieces.","created_at":"2018-01-29T20:48:08Z","updated_at":"2018-03-16T22:14:07Z","closed_at":"2018-03-10T04:06:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fb1845be2ed6cd772cdb9b40bfffb21e0dee6486","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/840/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/840/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/840/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5ab92d2e78a10a6f22d9abb78f814c8974a3c228","head":{"label":"derisavi-huawei:master","ref":"master","sha":"5ab92d2e78a10a6f22d9abb78f814c8974a3c228","user":{"login":"derisavi-huawei","id":33945117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTQ1MTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33945117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei","html_url":"https://github.com/derisavi-huawei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112238709,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIyMzg3MDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"derisavi-huawei/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"derisavi-huawei","id":33945117,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzOTQ1MTE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33945117?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei","html_url":"https://github.com/derisavi-huawei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/derisavi-huawei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/derisavi-huawei/tvm","description":"End

In order to pass in this array to OpenGL shader, we need to add type info to `AllocWorkspace`.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Added `int dtype_code_hint` and `int dtye_bits_hint` to `TVMBackendAllocWorkspace`.\r\n- Added `TVMType type_hint` to `DeviceAPI::AllocWorkspace`.\r\n- In `HostDeviceSplitter`, record type into `handle_data_type_` every time we see `Allocate* op`. In this way the device function knows type of the allocated array (instead of `void*`).\r\n- Modified lower.\r\n- Modified stackvm runner.\r\n- Added
