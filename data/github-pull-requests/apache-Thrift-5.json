Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\nZephyr's byteorder is defined in `<zephyr/sys/byteorder.h>`. However, the `bswap_xx` macros are also defined there. They need to be `#undef`d first when building for big-endian architectures, since the Thrift byteorder macros are no-ops for little-endian architectures.\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?

limitation is to create recurrence types with a default value of the same type because it generates inf recursion.\r\n\r\nApache Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-4623\r\n\r\n

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\n- Adds a full Swift cross test suite, implementing nearly all of the tests (except for one-way functions which the Swift generator doesn't currently support [THRIFT-5468](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5468)).\r\n- Adds Swift to the list of cross test languages running on Github Actions.\r\n- Adds UUID support to the Swift generator and client lib ([THRIFT-5629](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5629)). I thought about separating this into a separate pull request but these changes are needed for the cross tests to pass against the kotlin/java libraries which currently run on CI.\r\n- Fixes [THRIFT-5630](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-5630) where the TSocketServer does not work on Linux. Again this is included here because without it the cross tests won't pass on CI\r\n- Fixes a few small issues in the Swift library cross compatibility that weren't detected before tests\r\n- Makes a small change to insanity test in the kotlin/java cross test servers because they don't provide the value of `userMap` or `xtructs` fields in the Insanity object. These fields are required in the Swift generated code (because the field is not marked as optional in the TestThrift.thrift specification and the Swift generator doesn't support default values yet) \r\n\r\nPossible breaking change: \r\n- In the `TType` enum, the integer value of 17 was already taken by `TType.utf16` but this was incompatible with java/kotlin which use the value 17 for the `uuid` type. I'm not sure if this type is in use or considered part of the public API because it's not listed in the spec: https://thrift.apache.org/docs/idl.html \r\n\r\nI understand this is a fairly large PR, I'm open to suggestions on splitting it up if necessary, either merging in the tests first (which wouldn't pass), or merging in fixes individually first (but then there won't be any tests run against those PRs)\r\n\r\nThanks to @janosvitok for the WIP of the cross test suite, of which the PR is based off of. \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing properly.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-20T23:24:35Z","updated_at":"2022-10-23T02:19:46Z","closed_at":"2022-10-08T06:13:01Z","merged_at":"2022-10-08T06:13:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9da9eb05993a235df999226303bc594e4778805","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2670/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/2670/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/issues/2670/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/thrift/statuses/c9713b9950604256b9f1551ba973ead210514946","head":{"label":"kinoroy:THRIFT-4547-swift-cross-tests","ref":"THRIFT-4547-swift-cross-tests","sha":"c9713b9950604256b9f1551ba973ead210514946","user":{"login":"kinoroy","id":22554212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTU0MjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22554212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy","html_url":"https://github.com/kinoroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":533547780,"node_id":"R_kgDOH81LBA","name":"thrift","full_name":"kinoroy/thrift","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kinoroy","id":22554212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTU0MjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22554212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy","html_url":"https://github.com/kinoroy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kinoroy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kinoroy/thrift","description":"Apache

Description\r\nThis PR adds minimum token permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN in GitHub Actions workflows using https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows. \r\n\r\nGitHub Actions workflows have a GITHUB_TOKEN with `write` access to multiple scopes. \r\nHere is an example of the permissions in one of the workflows:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/thrift/actions/runs/3045440603/jobs/4907003617#step:1:19\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the scopes will be reduced to the minimum needed for each workflow. \r\n\r\n### Motivation and Context\r\n\r\n- This is a security best practice, so if the GITHUB_TOKEN is compromised due to a vulnerability or compromised Action, the damage will be reduced. \r\n- GitHub recommends defining minimum GITHUB_TOKEN permissions. \r\nhttps://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token\r\n- The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) [Scorecards](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard) also treats not setting token permissions as a high-risk issue. This change will help increase the Scorecard score for this repository. \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Varun Sharma <varunsh@stepsecurity.io>\r\n  \r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [ ] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nIt seems that Apache Thrift wants to drop Boost dependency eventually.\r\nSee also: https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/4646a3557b822c3893dc6773882a689118b77611/lib/cpp/CMakeLists.txt#L20-L21\r\n\r\n    # Remove the following once lib/cpp no longer depends on boost headers:\r\n    include(BoostMacros)\r\n\r\nThis is a step for it. We don't need to use boost::scoped_array because\r\nwe can use std::unique_ptr. We require C++11 or later and std::unique_ptr\r\ncan be used with C++11 or later.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?  (not required for trivial changes)\r\n- [x] If a ticket exists: Does your pull request title follow the pattern \"THRIFT-NNNN: describe my issue\"?\r\n- [x] Did you squash your changes to a single commit?  (not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?  If one was needed, did you label the Jira ticket with \"Breaking-Change\"?\r\n- [x] If your change does not involve any code, include `[skip ci]` anywhere in the commit message to free up build resources.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  The Contributing Guide at:\r\n  https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n  has more details and tips for committing

(not required, but preferred)\r\n- [x] Did you do your best to avoid breaking changes?

Explain the changes in the pull request below: -->\r\n\r\nCurrently Kotlin compiler generates an extension file per package in order to enhance TProcotol.java and have a clean generated file. The extension methods are inline only so no impact on the runtime but these methods can further be helpful for Java libraries.\r\n\r\nWe can improve the TProtocol.java by incorporating these methods, and also clean up the code a bit by splitting into read and write interfaces.\r\n\r\nThis pull request also adds missing `@Overrides` annotations.\r\n\r\n<!-- We recommend you review the checklist/tips before submitting a pull request. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Did you create an [Apache Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/THRIFT/issues/) ticket?
