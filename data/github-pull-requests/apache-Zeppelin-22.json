This result in classloading problems when SparkInterpreter is trying to build up Spark Context, in case SparkInterpreter is started by scheduler on same thread.\r\n\r\nIn short when running subsequent paragraphs, users will get an ambiguous NullPointerException, which is hard to understand as it hides the root cause of the problem. As a safety measure to prevent such cases RemoteInterpreterServer should save & restore original thread context classloader.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3209\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* Use Spark 2.2 and Scala 2.11.8\r\n* create a notebook with two paragraphs\r\n* in first paragraph use %spark.dep interpreter and add load some dependencies\r\n* in second paragraph use %spark interpreter and run some spark code\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-07T10:46:08Z","updated_at":"2018-07-04T14:20:32Z","closed_at":"2018-02-20T17:08:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"783cadcf28cbd0ed9bfc4c7442896d83d1016cc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/2771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/2771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/dd3a305daac922424d5acdf4a73f7297274cdfc5","head":{"label":"banzaicloud:master-ZEPPELIN-3209","ref":"master-ZEPPELIN-3209","sha":"dd3a305daac922424d5acdf4a73f7297274cdfc5","user":{"login":"banzaicloud","id":32848483,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMyODQ4NDgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32848483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud","html_url":"https://github.com/banzaicloud","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/banzaicloud/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"bf923dc13c6051bc1a2622724300c56458d7ca08","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nSupport saving notebooks to Google Cloud Storage, similar to implementations for S3 and Azure. It uses the same authentication mechanisms as the BigQuery interpreter.\r\n\r\nI am new to Maven, so please check my work on the pom.xml files. In particular, I upgraded Guava to 23.0, which was required for `google-cloud-java`. Going through hello-world with my changes seems to work.\r\n\r\nAlso, I modified the BigQuery interpreter docs to point to the **latest** GCS storage docs.

Such as unused import is not detected. The is the first PR for adding code style check. It just improve the code style check file , but just disable it for now. I have created subtask under ZEPPELIN-3137 for each module.  This `checkstyle.xml` is from spark project.
