declares several methods with SQL statement and parameters like this\r\n```java\r\npublic boolean execute(String sql, List<Object> params) throws SLQException {\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis declaration has one major drawback: it's not possible to pass as an argument the List which is not exactly `List<Object>`, e.g. `List<Integer>`.\r\n\r\nThis List is only iterated, hence using wildcard here is safe. Also changing the type to wildcard as receiving argument should be binary compatible.\r\n\r\nSuggested method signature (example; address all such methods of Sql class):\r\n```java\r\npublic boolean execute(String sql, List<?> params) throws SLQException {\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n* there are few methods that return `List<Object>`, e.g. `SqlWithParams.getParams()` - in this case the Object generic should be preserved.\r\n* For reference: pretty similar problem solved for cassandra-java-driver

should vastly reduce the number of network requests made by the <code>wrapper-validation-action</code>, by hardcoding the checksums of all known Gradle wrapper jars at time of release. With this improvement, a number of long-standing issues should be addressed (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/164\">#164</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/162\">#162</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/57\">#57</a>).</p>\n<p>The action should now only make network requests to validate the checksums of an unknown <code>gradle-wrapper.jar</code>. This can happen if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gradle version was published after this action was released</li>\n<li>The <code>gradle-wrapper.jar</code> is truly invalid</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[NEW] Hardcode list of known checksums to avoid network requests in most cases (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/161\">#161</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Huge thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a> for contributing this long-awaited improvement.</p>\n<h2>v2.0.1</h2>\n<p>This patch release fixes error reporting when failing to retrieve the checksums from services.gradle.org</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[FIX] After migration from v1 to v2 silently fails (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/174\">#174</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/commit/f9c9c575b8b21b6485636a91ffecd10e558c62f6\"><code>f9c9c57</code></a> Bump to v3.5.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/commit/88425854a36845f9c881450d9660b5fd46bee142\"><code>8842585</code></a> Bump to v3.4.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/commit/9ba54b687bf0f59b62abbf91e0d60de082e8ebc4\"><code>9ba54b6</code></a> Bump to v3.4.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/commit/26ffd686eccbbcbf168186b5363c8ee8edbe39f6\"><code>26ffd68</code></a> Bump to v3.4.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/commit/216d1ad2b3710bf005dc39237337b9673fd8fcd5\"><code>216d1ad</code></a> Bump to v3.3.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/commit/5188e9b5527a0a094cee21e2fe9a8ca44b4629af\"><code>5188e9b</code></a> Bump to use v3.3.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/commit/460a3ca55fc5d559238a0efc7fa9f7465df8585d\"><code>460a3ca</code></a> Delegate to 'gradle/actions/wrapper-validation' (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/200\">#200</a>)</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/compare/v2...v3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=gradle/wrapper-validation-action&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=2&new-version=3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

GitHub Action will use the <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/wrapper\">Codecov Wrapper</a> to encapsulate the <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-cli\">CLI</a>. This will help ensure that the Action gets updates quicker.</p>\n<h3>Migration Guide</h3>\n<p>The <code>v5</code> release also coincides with the opt-out feature for tokens for public repositories. In the <code>Global Upload Token</code> section of the settings page of an organization in codecov.io, you can set the ability for Codecov to receive a coverage reports from any source. This will allow contributors or other members of a repository to upload without needing access to the Codecov token. For more details see <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/codecov-tokens#uploading-without-a-token\">how to upload without a token</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[!WARNING]<br />\n<strong>The following

PR converts the `RuntimeParserException`, which stops compilation, to a more detailed warning about using a `Trait` or `Interface` with more than one generic type parameter via inheritance.  \r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/grails/grails-data-mapping/issues/1811 which is a significant open issue for the Groovy 3.0.x to 4.0.x upgrade in preparation for Grails 7.  Grails 6 and lower were still on Groovy 3.0.x.\r\n\r\nPrecise simplified example of the code which results in the exception with Groovy 4.0.x compiler:  https://github.com/grails/grails-data-mapping/issues/1811#issue-2481317054\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/grails/grails-data-mapping/issues/1811#issuecomment-2419515195 - the decompiled Grails Domain Classes, compiled with Groovy 4.0.23, after changing the exception to a warning.   These Grails Domains, with inheritance, compile and run without issue once the exception is removed during pre-compilation verification.   \r\n\r\nIn each instance the `Trait` or `Interface` which is implemented with 2+ generic types via inheritance, have generic types which are compatible and extend in a lineage hierarchy.  \r\n\r\nThe Groovy 4 compiler only copies the lowest level Trait or Interface methods into the class, before compiling, which was the approach in Groovy 3 and same and expected approach in Groovy 4.\r\n\r\nExample output after restoring Domain Inheritance and Inheritance tests on https://github.com/grails/grails-data-mapping/\r\n\r\n```\r\n> Task :grails-datastore-gorm-tck:compileGroovy\r\nWarning:  on grails.gorm.tests.City the interface GormEntity was

should vastly reduce the number of network requests made by the <code>wrapper-validation-action</code>, by hardcoding the checksums of all known Gradle wrapper jars at time of release. With this improvement, a number of long-standing issues should be addressed (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/164\">#164</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/162\">#162</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/57\">#57</a>).</p>\n<p>The action should now only make network requests to validate the checksums of an unknown <code>gradle-wrapper.jar</code>. This can happen if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gradle version was published after this action was released</li>\n<li>The <code>gradle-wrapper.jar</code> is truly invalid</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[NEW] Hardcode list of known checksums to avoid network requests in most cases (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/161\">#161</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Huge thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/Marcono1234\"><code>@​Marcono1234</code></a> for contributing this long-awaited improvement.</p>\n<h2>v2.0.1</h2>\n<p>This patch release fixes error reporting when failing to retrieve the checksums from services.gradle.org</p>\n<ul>\n<li>[FIX] After migration from v1 to v2 silently fails (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/174\">#174</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/commit/460a3ca55fc5d559238a0efc7fa9f7465df8585d\"><code>460a3ca</code></a> Delegate to 'gradle/actions/wrapper-validation' (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/issues/200\">#200</a>)</li>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/wrapper-validation-action/compare/v2...v3\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=gradle/wrapper-validation-action&package-manager=github_actions&previous-version=2&new-version=3)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

[codecov/codecov-action](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action) from 3 to 4.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action/releases\">codecov/codecov-action's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>v4 of the Codecov Action uses the <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/the-codecov-cli\">CLI</a> as the underlying upload. The CLI has helped to power new features including local upload, the global upload token, and new upcoming features.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The Codecov Action runs as a <code>node20</code> action due to <code>node16</code> deprecation. See <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/\">this post from GitHub</a> on how to migrate.</li>\n<li>Tokenless uploading is unsupported. However, PRs made from forks to the upstream public repos will support tokenless (e.g. contributors to OS projects do not need the upstream repo's Codecov token). This <a href=\"https://docs.codecov.com/docs/adding-the-codecov-token#github-actions\">doc</a> shows instructions on how to add the Codecov token.</li>\n<li>OS platforms have been added, though some may not be automatically detected. To see a list of platforms, see our <a href=\"https://cli.codecov.io\">CLI download page</a></li>\n<li>Various arguments to the Action have been changed. Please be aware that the arguments match with the CLI's needs</li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>v3</code> versions and below will not have access to CLI features (e.g. global upload token, ATS).</p>\n<h2>What's
