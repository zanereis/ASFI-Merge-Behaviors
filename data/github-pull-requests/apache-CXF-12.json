The first version 6.0.0 was released in December 2017.\nOver the course of more than 5 years we published almost every month a new minor version of PMD 6\nwith new features and improvements.</p>\n<p>Already in November 2018 we started in parallel the development of the next major version 7.0.0,\nand we are now in the process of finalizing the scope of the major version. We want to release a couple of\nrelease candidates before publishing the final version 7.0.0.</p>\n<p>We plan to release 7.0.0-rc1 soon. You can see the progress in [PMD 7 Tracking Issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3898\">#3898</a>](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pmd/pmd/issues/3898\">pmd/pmd#3898</a>).</p>\n<h4>Java 20 Support</h4>\n<p>This release of PMD brings support for Java 20. There are no new standard language features.</p>\n<p>PMD supports <a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/433\">JEP 433: Pattern Matching for switch (Fourth Preview)</a> and\n<a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/432\">JEP 432: Record Patterns (Second Preview)</a> as preview language features.</p>\n<p>In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these language features,\nyou'll need to enable it via the environment variable <code>PMD_JAVA_OPTS</code> and select the new language\nversion <code>20-preview</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview\n./run.sh pmd --use-version java-20-preview ...\n</code></pre>\n<h4>T-SQL support</h4>\n<p>Thanks to the contribution from <a href=\"https://github.com/pguyot\">Paul Guyot</a> PMD now has CPD support\nfor T-SQL (Transact-SQL).</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

describes the noteworthy improvements provided by each release of Eclipse Tycho.</p>\n<h2>4.0.0 (under development)</h2>\n<h3>Class loading changes for Eclipse based tests</h3>\n<p>Due to reported class loading clashes, the ordering of class loading has been modified in Eclipse based tests.\nThe previous loading can be restored by a new <code>classLoaderOrder</code> parameter.\nThis applies to <code>tycho-surefire-plugin:test</code> and <code>tycho-surefire-plugin:plugin-test</code>.</p>\n<h3>new bnd-test mojo</h3>\n<p>Tycho now has a new mojo <code>tycho-surefire-plugin:bnd-test</code> to easily execute tests using the <a href=\"https://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/310-testing.html\">bnd-testing</a> framework.\nThis is similar to <code>tycho-surefire-plugin:plugin-test</code> but uses the BND testing framework, integrates nicely with the <a href=\"https://github.com/osgi/osgi-test\">OSGi Testing Support</a>\nand allows to execute prebuild test-bundles.</p>\n<p>Additional information and a demo can be found here:\n<a href=\"https://tycho.eclipseprojects.io/doc/master/TestingBundles.html#bnd-testing\">https://tycho.eclipseprojects.io/doc/master/TestingBundles.html#bnd-testing</a></p>\n<h3>new tycho-baseline-plugin</h3>\n<p>Tycho now has a new mojo to perform baseline comparisons similar to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/blob/master/maven/bnd-baseline-maven-plugin/README.md\">bnd-baseline-plugin</a> but takes the tycho-dependency model into account.</p>\n<p>A usual configuration looks like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n   &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.tycho&lt;/groupId&gt;\n   &lt;artifactId&gt;tycho-baseline-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n   &lt;version&gt;${tycho.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n   &lt;executions&gt;\n     &lt;execution&gt;\n       &lt;id&gt;baseline-check&lt;/id&gt;\n       &lt;goals&gt;\n         &lt;goal&gt;verify&lt;/goal&gt;\n       &lt;/goals&gt;\n       &lt;configuration&gt;\n         &lt;baselines&gt;\n           &lt;repository&gt;\n\t\t\t   &lt;id&gt;optional, only required for proxy setup or password protected sites&lt;/id&gt;\n\t\t\t   &lt;url&gt;URL of P2 repository that should be used as a baseline&lt;/url&gt;\n\t\t   &lt;/repository&gt;\n         &lt;/baselines&gt;\n       &lt;/configuration&gt;\n     &lt;/execution&gt;\n   &lt;/executions&gt;\n &lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

2018-10-09)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Support Java 9, 10, and 11.</li>\n<li>Fix an ExceptionInInitializerError when plugin is used on Java 11 (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/issues/401\">401</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.0.0</h2>\n<h3>Revamped authentication support</h3>\n<p>Integrates <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-client/blob/dba55b17d09d4a15aa9d26884b22b230d49fce64/docs/user_manual.md#authentication-to-private-registries\">revamped support for authentication from\ndocker-client</a> into the plugin, making it possible for\nthe plugin to be more flexible in regards to authentication credentials used\nwhen pushing/pulling/building images.</p>\n<p>Previous versions of the plugin had the limitation of using the same\nRegistryAuth header for all images, regardless of what registries they came\nfrom.</p>\n<p>In this version, the docker-maven-plugin will automatically use any\nauthentication present in the docker-cli configuration file at <code>~/.dockercfg</code>\nor <code>~/.docker/config.json</code>.</p>\n<p>Additionally the plugin will enable support for Google Container Registry if it\nis able to successfully load <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials\">Google's &quot;Application Default Credentials&quot;</a>.\nThe plugin will also load Google credentials from the file pointed to by the\nenvironment variable <code>DOCKER_GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS</code> if it is defined. Since GCR\nauthentication requires retrieving short-lived access codes for the given\ncredentials, support for this registry is baked into the underlying\ndocker-client rather than having to first populate the docker config file\nbefore running the plugin.</p>\n<p>Lastly, authentication credentials can be explicitly configured in your pom.xml\nand in your Maven installation's <code>settings.xml</code> file as part of the\n<code>&lt;servers&gt;&lt;/servers&gt;</code> block.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/pull/339\">339</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/c34270f4a96ee17675b196861baa06421e0f0fdf\"><code>c34270f</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release v1.2.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/960ed96fe04e1eb0008f6dcdfa9edab8cf17a522\"><code>960ed96</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/issues/438\">#438</a> from spotify/dxia/network-mode</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/80ad9461ba906d0a7f700c1d2b95fedc8ef1e072\"><code>80ad946</code></a> Support 'networkmode' option when building docker image</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/aa7fab35d6bab8022361577b6395177b21b4f8d0\"><code>aa7fab3</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/6dd542b668591cad8915f47667dcf37352161847\"><code>6dd542b</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release v1.2.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/6db655f5966dcbb826d2aa549f9a25345c5efac6\"><code>6db655f</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/issues/430\">#430</a> from spotify/dxia/upgrade-docker-client</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/0ab7e3c886212c4e78c543f43055f70e60a77058\"><code>0ab7e3c</code></a> Ignore two findbugs violations</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/bbe5ce228e995613ff298e38cc3e35c5cd13ab62\"><code>bbe5ce2</code></a> Upgrade findbugs-maven-plugin from 3.0.0 to 3.0.5</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/c93a56b28c4736dcbb22da96c112653e2dedeb91\"><code>c93a56b</code></a> Temporarily disable checkstyle</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/commit/cd24c738299fb669aad4caed8166749365138f66\"><code>cd24c73</code></a> Upgrade docker-client dep from 8.14.1 to 8.16.0</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/docker-maven-plugin/compare/v0.4.9...v1.2.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.spotify:docker-maven-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=0.4.9&new-version=1.2.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

the <a

Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug that forced the <code>init</code> Action to run for at least two minutes on JavaScript. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1494\">#1494</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.39 - 18 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeQL Action v1 is now deprecated, and is no longer updated or supported. For better performance, improved security, and new features, upgrade to v2. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-18-code-scanning-codeql-action-v1-is-now-deprecated/\">this changelog post</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1466\">#1467</a></li>\n<li>Python automatic dependency installation will no longer fail for projects using Poetry that specify <code>virtualenvs.options.no-pip = true</code> in their <code>poetry.toml</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1431\">#1431</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing a stack trace and error message when the action fails to find the SHA at the\ncurrent directory. This will happen in several non-error states and so we now avoid cluttering the\nlog with this message. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1485\">#1485</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.38 - 12 Jan 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-reporter-java/releases\">zipkin-sender-okhttp3's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter 2.12 improves stability of the <code>AsyncReporter</code> during shutdown and with certain sender implementations.</p>\n<p><code>ClosedSenderException</code> was added to signal when a sender is used after having been closed. Previously, sender implementations used an implicit convention of throwing <code>new IllegalStateException(&quot;closed&quot;);</code> to signal this, but this makes it more difficult for logic to differentiate against other <code>IllegalStateException</code> that may be thrown by a sender. All sender implementations going forward should throw <code>ClosedSenderException</code> instead.</p>\n<h2>Zipkin Reporter 2.9</h2>\n<p>Zipkin Reporter v2.9 adds <code>zipkin-sender-activemq-client</code>, supporting the <a href=\"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/tree/master/zipkin-collector/activemq\">ActiveMQ 5.x collector</a> available in Zipkin Server v2.15+.

the Eclipse Java Compiler</h3>\n<p>Previously forking was not supported, now forking is possible and will be used if a custom java home is specified.</p>\n<h3>New option to transform P2 dependencies into real maven coordinates</h3>\n<p>The <code>tycho-consumer-pom</code> mojo has a new option to resolve p2 introduced dependencies to 'real' maven coordinates now, when enabled it queries maven-central with the SHA1 of the file to find out what are the actual maven central coordinates\nand place them in the generated pom consumer-pom.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.tycho&lt;/groupId&gt;\n\t&lt;artifactId&gt;tycho-packaging-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n\t&lt;version&gt;${tycho-version}&lt;/version&gt;\n\t&lt;configuration&gt;\n\t\t&lt;mapP2Dependencies&gt;true&lt;/mapP2Dependencies&gt;\n\t&lt;/configuration&gt;\n&lt;/plugin&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>New tycho-p2-plugin:dependency-tree mojo</h3>\n<p>Sometimes it is useful to find out how dependencies of a project are actually pulled in. Tycho now supports a new <code>tycho-p2-plugin:dependency-tree</code> mojo that outputs a tree view of the P2 dependecies of a tycho project.</p>\n<p>Example with Tycho integration test project:</p>\n<pre><code>tycho-its/projects/reactor.makeBehaviour$ mvn org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-p2-plugin:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT:dependency-tree\n<p>...</p>\n<p>[INFO] --- tycho-p2-plugin:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT:dependency-tree (default-cli) @ feature2 ---\n[INFO] tycho-its-project.reactor.makeBehaviour:feature2:eclipse-feature:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\n[INFO] +- feature2.feature.group (1.0.0.qualifier) --&gt; [tycho-its-project.reactor.makeBehaviour:feature2:eclipse-feature:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT]\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug that forced the <code>init</code> Action to run for at least two minutes on JavaScript. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1494\">#1494</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.39 - 18 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeQL Action v1 is now deprecated, and is no longer updated or supported. For better performance, improved security, and new features, upgrade to v2. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-18-code-scanning-codeql-action-v1-is-now-deprecated/\">this changelog post</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1466\">#1467</a></li>\n<li>Python automatic dependency installation will no longer fail for projects using Poetry that specify <code>virtualenvs.options.no-pip = true</code> in their <code>poetry.toml</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1431\">#1431</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing a stack trace and error message when the action fails to find the SHA at the\ncurrent directory.

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>2.0.0</h2>\n<p>Despite the major version bump, this should be a drop in replacement for almost every project, The two major possible incompatibilities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The minimum supported Java version is now 1.5, up from 1.4 in 1.2.0 and 1.3 in 1.1.6.</li>\n<li>dom4j, XOM, and JDOM are now optional dependencies so if a project\nwas depending on them to be loaded transitively it will need to add\nexplicit dependencies to build.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the plus side, this makes classpaths much smaller and less complex, and will shut up a lot of noise from static analysis tools.</p>\n<p>In addition the Jaxen core code is also a little smaller and has fixed a few minor bugs in XPath evaluation, mostly weird cases found by fuzzing that are unlikely to arise in practice.</p>\n<h2>v1.2.0</h2>\n<p>Deprecate pattern package.\nRequire Java 1.4.\nDon't bundle

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.2 - 06 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug that forced the <code>init</code> Action to run for at least two minutes on JavaScript. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1494\">#1494</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.39 - 18 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeQL Action v1 is now deprecated, and is no longer updated or supported. For better performance, improved security, and new features, upgrade to v2.

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug that forced the <code>init</code> Action to run for at least two minutes on JavaScript. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1494\">#1494</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.39 - 18 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeQL Action v1 is now deprecated, and is no longer updated or supported. For better performance, improved security, and new features, upgrade to v2. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-18-code-scanning-codeql-action-v1-is-now-deprecated/\">this changelog post</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1466\">#1467</a></li>\n<li>Python automatic dependency installation will no longer fail for projects using Poetry that specify <code>virtualenvs.options.no-pip = true</code> in their <code>poetry.toml</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1431\">#1431</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing a stack trace and error message when the action fails to find the SHA at the\ncurrent directory.

href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">github/codeql-action's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug that forced the <code>init</code> Action to run for at least two minutes on JavaScript. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1494\">#1494</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.39 - 18 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeQL Action v1 is now deprecated, and is no longer updated or supported. For better performance, improved security, and new features, upgrade to v2. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-18-code-scanning-codeql-action-v1-is-now-deprecated/\">this changelog post</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1466\">#1467</a></li>\n<li>Python automatic dependency installation will no longer fail for projects using Poetry that specify <code>virtualenvs.options.no-pip = true</code> in their <code>poetry.toml</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1431\">#1431</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing a stack trace and error message when the action fails to find the SHA at the\ncurrent directory. This will happen in several non-error states and so we now avoid cluttering the\nlog with this message. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1485\">#1485</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.38 - 12 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1466\">#1466</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.37 - 14 Dec 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.6. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1433\">#1433</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.36 - 08 Dec 2022</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.5. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1412\">#1412</a></li>\n<li>Add a step that tries to upload a SARIF file for the workflow run when that workflow run fails. This will help better surface failed code scanning workflow runs. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1393\">#1393</a></li>\n<li>Python automatic dependency installation will no longer consider dependency code installed in venv as user-written, for projects using Poetry that specify <code>virtualenvs.in-project = true</code> in their <code>poetry.toml</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1419\">#1419</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.35 - 01 Dec 2022</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Summary\n\nThis pull request is created by [Secure Workflows](https://app.stepsecurity.io/securerepo) at the request of @coheigea. Please merge the Pull Request to incorporate the requested changes. Please tag @coheigea on your message if you have any questions related to the PR. You can also engage with the [StepSecurity](https://github.com/step-security) team by tagging @step-security-bot.\n\n## Security Fixes\n\n### Pinned Dependencies\n\nA *pinned dependency* is a dependency that is explicitly set to a specific hashed version instead of a mutable version. Pinned dependencis ensure that development and deployment are done with the same software versions which reduces deployment risks, and enables reproducibility. It can help mitigate compromised dependencies from undermining the security of the project in certain scenarios. The dependencies were pinned using [Secure WorkFlows](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows)\n\n- [GitHub Security Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)\n- [The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Security Guide](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies)\n\n\n## Feedback\nFor bug reports, feature requests, and general feedback; please create an issue in [step-security/secure-workflows](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows).

Summary\n\nThis pull request is created by [Secure Workflows](https://app.stepsecurity.io/securerepo) at the request of @coheigea. Please merge the Pull Request to incorporate the requested changes. Please tag @coheigea on your message if you have any questions related to the PR. You can also engage with the [StepSecurity](https://github.com/step-security) team by tagging @step-security-bot.\n\n## Security Fixes\n\n### Pinned Dependencies\n\nA *pinned dependency* is a dependency that is explicitly set to a specific hashed version instead of a mutable version. Pinned dependencis ensure that development and deployment are done with the same software versions which reduces deployment risks, and enables reproducibility. It can help mitigate compromised dependencies from undermining the security of the project in certain scenarios. The dependencies were pinned using [Secure WorkFlows](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows)\n\n- [GitHub Security Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)\n- [The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Security Guide](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies)\n### Harden Runner\n\n[Harden-Runner](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) is an open-source security agent for the GitHub-hosted runner to prevent software supply chain attacks. It prevents exfiltration of credentials, detects tampering of source code during build, and enables running jobs without `sudo` access.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Harden runner usage</summary>\n\nYou can find link to view insights and policy recommendation in the build log\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner/blob/main/images/buildlog1.png?raw=true\" width=\"60%\" height=\"60%\">\n\nPlease refer to [documentation](https://docs.stepsecurity.io/harden-runner/getting-started#why-monitor-cicd-runtime) to find more details.\n</details>\n\n### Keeping your actions up to date with Dependabot\n\nThe package ecosystem to update github-actions is added using [Secure WorkFlows](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows). This is recommended by GitHub as well as The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF).\n\n- [GitHub Security Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/working-with-dependabot/keeping-your-actions-up-to-date-with-dependabot)\n- [The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Security Guide](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#dependency-update-tool)\n\n\n## Feedback\nFor bug reports, feature requests, and general feedback; please create an issue in [step-security/secure-workflows](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows).
