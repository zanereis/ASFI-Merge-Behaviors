Description\r\n\r\nThis change is to the base test classes. At the moment they mock out the response, raw response and connection classes. Which is fine but it's led to issues that could have been uncovered in the unit tests because it doesn't represent how the drivers actually respond.\r\n\r\nThis change will replace the mock connection and mock response classes with the actual implementations and use a `requests_mock` session context manager to get the response from the existing methods so hopefully I won't need to change each of the test classes.\r\n\r\nFor more information on contributing, please see [Contributing](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#contributing)\r\nsection of our documentation.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nReplace this: describe the PR status.

Changes Title: Fix impossible location condition\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhen requesting a list of publishers from other parts of the code (such as when listing images), a condition can be encountered where the `location` has been passed in (and therefore is not `None`), but  `self.default_location` is also set. The `location` that is passed in should be used, but the condition doesn't allow it to be.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that

is the second design concept for async support in Libcloud.\r\n\r\nThis will only support Python 3.5+ (but cleanly handle older versions)\r\n\r\nThe concept here is to have Asynchronous Mixins, `LibcloudConnection` uses `requests` and `LibcloudAsyncConnection` uses aiohttp for async transport.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tonybaloney/libcloud/blob/d4fe097476d2f02941e17d5e1b1d405fcf44c0f7/libcloud/connection_async.py#L22-L42\r\n\r\nThe `LibcloudAsyncConnection` is an implementation detail of `AsyncConnection`, which is the API for the drivers to consume.\r\nhttps://github.com/tonybaloney/libcloud/blob/d4fe097476d2f02941e17d5e1b1d405fcf44c0f7/libcloud/common/base.py#L742-L778\r\n\r\nThe drivers then use this mixin for their custom connection classes, e.g. \r\nhttps://github.com/tonybaloney/libcloud/blob/b0e06700bd206b1af10663e2f8c006303536bf4b/libcloud/storage/drivers/google_storage.py#L77\r\n\r\nThey then inherit from `StorageAsyncDriver`, which uses a new set of base methods, e.g. `iterate_containers_async` and can be implemented like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tonybaloney/libcloud/blob/b0e06700bd206b1af10663e2f8c006303536bf4b/libcloud/storage/drivers/google_storage.py#L215-L224 \r\n\r\nNow the consumer can more or less do this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom libcloud.storage.providers import get_driver\r\nfrom libcloud.storage.types import Provider\r\n\r\nimport asyncio\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nKEY = sys.getenv('GOOGLE_KEY')\r\nSECRET = sys.getenv('GOOGLE_SECRET')\r\n\r\nGoogleStorageDriver = get_driver(Provider.GOOGLE_STORAGE)\r\ndriver = GoogleStorageDriver(key=KEY, secret=SECRET)\r\n\r\ndef do_stuff_with_object(obj):\r\n    print(obj)\r\n\r\nasync def run():\r\n    tasks = []\r\n    async for container in driver.iterate_containers_async():\r\n        async for obj in driver.iterate_container_objects_async(container):\r\n            tasks.append(asyncio.ensure_future(do_stuff_with_object(obj)))\r\n    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\r\n\r\nloop = asyncio.get_event_loop()\r\nloop.run_until_complete(run())\r\nloop.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nFYI, this currently doesn't work, it's a rough sketch.\r\nAlso, it hides some of the imports for `aiohttp` and `asyncio` so that existing use cases don't break for Python 3.5<\r\n","created_at":"2017-04-07T03:16:58Z","updated_at":"2017-10-15T01:18:00Z","closed_at":"2017-10-15T01:18:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"31e3f6ead1e6c20c45df44c80180537436917964","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/1027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/1027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/b0e06700bd206b1af10663e2f8c006303536bf4b","head":{"label":"tonybaloney:async_2","ref":"async_2","sha":"b0e06700bd206b1af10663e2f8c006303536bf4b","user":{"login":"tonybaloney","id":1532417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzI0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1532417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney","html_url":"https://github.com/tonybaloney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tonybaloney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"f6aaee21b5adc1e4bfef412062962966d2439f32","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":419555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTk1NTU=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"apache/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud","description":"Apache

Reimplement the CertificateConnection class using urllib3 and requests\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn 2.0, the httplib module was used as a low-level module for making requests to the APIs, some drivers used a `CertificateConnection` class in `libcloud.common.base`, which accepted an x509 certificate to be used for encoding the requests.\r\n\r\nThose drivers are : \r\n- Azure (classic)\r\n- Docker (with TLS)\r\n- OpenStack\r\n\r\nThis PR will reimplement the CertificateConnection class inside `libcloud.httplib_ssl` by mounting a `HTTPAdapter` to the requests session, detecting TLS and signing requests for the cert file.\r\n\r\nWe also need a test for this issue.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Reintroduce S3 multipart upload support with signature v4\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAll S3 regions now support signature V4. Rather than try to implement multipart\r\nuploads with both V2 and V4, all region drivers have been converted to use\r\nthe latter. All multipart changes are based on code which existed in v1.5.0.\r\n\r\nSome minor adjustments were made to the use of requests made throughout\r\nthe BaseS3StorageDriver class. The practice of constructing request paths with\r\nparameters included needed to be removed. It causes issues during the\r\nsignature calculation. The solution is to use the params argument instead.\r\nIn addition, a fix was necessary in the signature calculation to not compute a\r\npayload hash in the event of file uploads. It seems this was already taken into\r\nconsideration but failed to account for the scenario where an iterator is\r\npassed to the data argument.\r\n\r\nI have tested these changes against S3 using each of the following methods and with each regional driver.\r\n\r\nget_container\r\ncreate_container\r\ndelete_container\r\nlist_container_objects\r\nget_object\r\ndelete_object\r\nupload_object\r\nupload_object_via_stream\r\ndownload_object\r\ndownload_object_via_stream\r\nex_iterate_multipart_uploads\r\nex_cleanup_all_multipart_uploads\r\n\r\n###

Bug fix for `ex_destroy_subnetwork`\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nlibcloud assumes that the Google subnetwork API is synchronous which does not appear to be the case. This causes breakage in ansible where the libcloud API for `ex_destroy_subnetwork` reports that is has successfully destroyed the subnetwork. Immediate calls to `ex_destroy_network` seem to indicate that the subnetwork has not been destroyed as the network is reported to still be in use by the subnetwork. This bug fix is also verified to fix this race condition that causes ansible to fail when sequentially executing the code in PR ansible/ansible-modules-core#3773 first for subnetwork deletion and then for network deletion.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [X] [Code

A Driver Implementation for the cloudscale.ch API\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt's pretty simple, I have added a new driver for the cloudscale.ch API (https://www.cloudscale.ch/en/api/v1). The cloudscale.ch API is very simple and doesn't offer a lot more than what libcloud's `compute` module by default offers. I have also tried to communicate this in the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nThe code feels mostly like it's done and ready for review. It passes 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, lint and pylint. I have looked at other drivers in libcloud and tried to copy how they document/test. I haven't added tons of tests, but comparably to others the driver is also smaller and therefore the amount of tests seem to align.\r\n\r\nJust let me know what you think. Happy to improve my code!\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be

Add support for creating multiple nodes on a subnetwork\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a reopen of PR #798 per the request of @supertom. I have rebased and reapplied the changes to current libcloud.\r\n \r\nCurrently for GCE, the multi node creation API does not support creating multiple nodes on a subnetwork. I have made changes to the `ex_create_multiple_nodes` function and the functions it calls to support creation of nodes on a given subnetwork. If subnetwork is `None`, the changes fall back to legacy network behavior on GCE so it is backwards compatible. There was one change to `_create_node_req` that was needed to get disk types which is simply passing in the location provided as an argument to `ex_get_disktype`.\r\n### Status\r\n- ready for

tests have been amended.\r\n\r\nA change has been added to the libcloud/common/base.py file to ensure that a request that returns with a HTTP status of 202 is not flagged as a failed request. Before this, only 200 and 201 were flagged as successful requests.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- Code linting for the compute driver implementation and the accompanying test file has been completed using the ```flake8``` tool.\r\n\r\n- Documentation has been updated consisting of examples of using all core and extended functionality specific to ProfitBricks. A demo file with instructions on creating two servers has been put together and these will be published on the ProfitBricks community website.\r\n\r\n- All test fixtures for api calls have been added in JSON format, replacing the older XML fixtures.
