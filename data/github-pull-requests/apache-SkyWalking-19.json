service or instance or interface latitude in some cases when I only want to see the exception trace, or  the trace that has cost a very long time? But I do not want to configure the global `sampling rate` and `trace latency`, by reason of the storage layer cannot support large data load.\r\n- We  can configure in a yaml:\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  - name: serverName # the server name which show skywalking-ui\r\n    instances:\r\n      - name: hostName@127.0.0.1 # the server instance which show skywalking-ui\r\n        sampleRate: 900 # instance latitude\r\n        duration: 10000 # trace latency time\r\n    endpoints:\r\n      - name: '/url' # the endpoint\r\n        sampleRate: 800\r\n        duration: 10000 # trace latency time\r\n    sampleRate: 1000 # endpoint latitude\r\n    duration: 10000 # trace latency

情况说明\r\n在下近来部署skywalking,使用的是直接在vm上部署（未使用docker）,我觉得了解一个应用最好的方式就是手动开始，而不是使用一些“包装”性的方式。\r\n\r\n但是我发现skywalking的启动脚本中是使用了 `eval exec &`这种放在了后台的方式，且没有其他选项。\r\n\r\n刚开始我想使用supervisor管理skywalking,

created, and the span needs to be finished in asynchronous mode, the attributes in the span cannot be modified after stopping the current span by invoking `org.apache.skywalking.apm.agent.core.context.ContextManager#stopSpan` method.\r\nTherefore, the solution is to judge the `isInAsyncMode` attribute in the span when modifying the span
