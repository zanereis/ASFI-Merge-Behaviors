As a result, the for-loop in computeAllMetrics() can terminate earlier and return an all-0 procfs metric.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn the case of a child pid's stat file missing and the subsequent child pids' stat files exist, ProcfsMetricsGetter.computeAllMetrics() will return partial metrics (the sum of a subset of child pids), which can be misleading and is undesired per the existing code comments in https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/ProcfsMetricsGetter.scala#L214.\r\n\r\nAlso, a side effect of this bug is that it can lead to a verbose warning log if many pids' stat files are missing. An early terminating can make the warning logs more concise.\r\n\r\nThe unit test can also explain the bug well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBoth AQE and DPP can be applied at the same time in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34168, while AQE and DPP can only enable when the join is Broadcast hash join at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThis pr supports Dynamic Partition Pruning in Adaptive Execution  can be applied at the same time in more scenarios , the processing idea is as follows:\r\n1. Firstly, we should check whether the inputPlan has a BroadcastHashJoinExec of the build side before the adaptive dynamic pruning optimizer rule.\r\n2. When the above broadcastHashJoinExec exists but the broadcastQueryStage of the build side of join has't created, we should create a broadcastQueryStage of the build side for the DPP optimizer, and cache it for AQE reuse.\r\n3. When the above broadcastHashJoinExec exists and the broadcastQueryStage of the build side of join has created, we can reuse it again for the DPP optimizer\r\n4. When the above broadcastHashJoinExec does't exist, we should fallback the DPP optimizer.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo support Dynamic Partition Pruning in Adaptive Execution  can be applied at the same time in more scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unittests.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-23T09:51:45Z","updated_at":"2021-07-12T00:07:57Z","closed_at":"2021-07-12T00:07:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e673e0649262bcf7c18a6287dd3c7483fd8a9fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31941/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31941/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31941/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0208465f540323f8df849ef761c6d895541eb714","head":{"label":"weixiuli:support-dpp-aqe","ref":"support-dpp-aqe","sha":"0208465f540323f8df849ef761c6d895541eb714","user":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":140506691,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDA1MDY2OTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"weixiuli/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"weixiuli","id":39684231,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Njg0MjMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39684231?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli","html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weixiuli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/weixiuli/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR intends to fix the bug that does not apply right-padding for char types inside correlated subquries.\r\nFor example,  a query below returns nothing in master, but a correct result is `c`.\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(s\"CREATE TABLE t1(v VARCHAR(3), c CHAR(5)) USING parquet\")\r\nscala> sql(s\"CREATE TABLE t2(v VARCHAR(5), c CHAR(7)) USING parquet\")\r\nscala> sql(\"INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('c', 'b')\")\r\nscala> sql(\"INSERT INTO t2 VALUES ('a', 'b')\")\r\nscala> val df = sql(\"\"\"\r\n  |SELECT v FROM t1\r\n  |WHERE 'a' IN (SELECT v FROM t2 WHERE t2.c = t1.c )\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\nscala> df.show()\r\n+---+\r\n|  v|\r\n+---+\r\n+---+\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because `ApplyCharTypePadding`  does not handle the case above to apply right-padding into `'abc'`. This PR modifies the code in `ApplyCharTypePadding` for handling it correctly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Before this PR:\r\nscala> df.explain(true)\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nv: string\r\nProject [v#13]\r\n+- Filter a IN (list#12 [c#14])\r\n   :  +- Project [v#15]\r\n   :     +- Filter (c#16 = outer(c#14))\r\n   :        +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t2\r\n   :           +- Relation default.t2[v#15,c#16] parquet\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t1\r\n      +- Relation default.t1[v#13,c#14] parquet\r\n\r\nscala> df.show()\r\n+---+\r\n|  v|\r\n+---+\r\n+---+\r\n\r\n// After this PR:\r\nscala> df.explain(true)\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nv: string\r\nProject [v#43]\r\n+- Filter a IN (list#42 [c#44])\r\n   :  +- Project [v#45]\r\n   :     +- Filter (c#46 = rpad(outer(c#44), 7,  ))\r\n   :        +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t2\r\n   :           +- Relation default.t2[v#45,c#46] parquet\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.t1\r\n      +- Relation default.t1[v#43,c#44] parquet\r\n\r\nscala> df.show()\r\n+---+\r\n|  v|\r\n+---+\r\n|  c|\r\n+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fix is lated to TPCDS q17; the query returns nothing because of this bug: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31886/files#r599333799\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-32160 add a config(`EXECUTOR_ALLOW_SPARK_CONTEXT`) to switch allow/disallow to create `SparkContext` in executors and the default value of the config is `false`\r\n\r\n`ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrayBenchmark` will run fail when `EXECUTOR_ALLOW_SPARK_CONTEXT` use the default value because the `ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArrayBenchmark#withFakeTaskContext` method try to create a `SparkContext` manually in Executor Side.\r\n\r\nSo the main change of this pr is  set

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support native session window. Please refer the comments/design doc in SPARK-10816 for more details on the rationalization and design (could be outdated a bit compared to the PR).\r\n\r\nThe definition of the boundary of \"session window\" is [the timestamp of start event ~ the timestamp of last event + gap duration). That said, unlike time window, session window is a dynamic window which can expand if new input row is added to the session. To handle expansion of session window, Spark defines session window per input row, and \"merge\" windows if they can be merged (boundaries are overlapped).\r\n\r\nThis PR leverages two different approaches on merging session windows:\r\n\r\n1. merging session windows with Spark's aggregation logic (a variant of sort aggregation)\r\n2. updating session window for all rows bound to the same session, and applying aggregation logic afterwards\r\n\r\nFirst one is preferable as it outperforms compared to the second one, though it can be only used if merging session window can be applied altogether with aggregation. It is not applicable on all the cases, so second one is used to cover the remaining cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR also applies the optimization on merging input rows and existing sessions with retaining the order (group keys + start timestamp of session window), leveraging the fact the number of existing sessions per group key won't be huge.\r\n\r\nThe state format is versioned, so that we can bring a new state format if we find a better one.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor now, to deal with sessionization, Spark requires end users to play with (flat)MapGroupsWithState directly which has a couple of major drawbacks:\r\n\r\n1. (flat)MapGroupsWithState is lower level API and end users have to code everything in details for defining session window and merging windows\r\n2. built-in aggregate functions cannot be used and end users have to deal with aggregation by themselves\r\n3. (flat)MapGroupsWithState is only available in Scala/Java.\r\n\r\nWith native support of session window, end users simply use \"session_window\" like they use \"window\" for tumbling/sliding window, and leverage built-in aggregate functions as well as UDAFs to simply define aggregations.\r\n\r\nQuoting the query example from test suite:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    val inputData = MemoryStream[(String, Long)]\r\n\r\n    // Split the lines into words, treat words as sessionId of events\r\n    val events = inputData.toDF()\r\n      .select($\"_1\".as(\"value\"), $\"_2\".as(\"timestamp\"))\r\n      .withColumn(\"eventTime\", $\"timestamp\".cast(\"timestamp\"))\r\n      .selectExpr(\"explode(split(value, ' ')) AS sessionId\", \"eventTime\")\r\n      .withWatermark(\"eventTime\", \"30 seconds\")\r\n\r\n    val sessionUpdates = events\r\n      .groupBy(session_window($\"eventTime\", \"10 seconds\") as 'session, 'sessionId)\r\n      .agg(count(\"*\").as(\"numEvents\"))\r\n      .selectExpr(\"sessionId\", \"CAST(session.start AS LONG)\", \"CAST(session.end AS LONG)\",\r\n        \"CAST(session.end AS LONG) - CAST(session.start AS LONG) AS durationMs\",\r\n        \"numEvents\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is same as StructuredSessionization (native session window is shorter and clearer even ignoring model classes).\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/39542bb81f8570219770bb6533c077f44f6cbd2a/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/sql/streaming/StructuredSessionization.scala#L66-L105 \r\n\r\n(Worth noting that the code in StructuredSessionization only works with processing time. The code doesn't consider old event can update the start time of old session.)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This PR brings the new feature to support session window on both batch and streaming query, which adds a new function \"session_window\" which usage is similar with \"window\".\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test suites. Also tested with benchmark code.","created_at":"2021-03-23T00:52:09Z","updated_at":"2021-07-14T00:07:28Z","closed_at":"2021-07-14T00:07:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a65a9d2f3909bd299ba6034633d6e2d3233d4550","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a new config, `spark.shuffle.service.name`, which allows for Spark applications to look for a YARN shuffle service which is defined at a name other than the default `spark_shuffle`.\r\n\r\nAdd a new config, `spark.yarn.shuffle.service.metrics.namespace`, which allows for configuring the namespace used when emitting metrics from the shuffle service into the NodeManager's `metrics2` system.\r\n\r\nAdd a new mechanism by which to override shuffle service configurations independently of the configurations in the NodeManager. When a resource `spark-shuffle-site.xml` is present on the classpath of the shuffle service, the configs present within it will be used to override the configs coming from `yarn-site.xml` (via the NodeManager).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere are two use cases which can benefit from these changes.\r\n\r\nOne use case is to run multiple instances of the shuffle service side-by-side in the same NodeManager. This can be helpful, for example, when running a YARN cluster with a mixed workload of applications running multiple Spark versions, since a given version of the shuffle service is not always compatible with other versions of Spark (e.g. see SPARK-27780). With this PR, it is possible to run two shuffle services like `spark_shuffle` and `spark_shuffle_3.2.0`, one of which is \"legacy\" and one of which is for new applications. This is possible because YARN versions since 2.9.0 support the ability to run shuffle services within an isolated classloader (see YARN-4577), meaning multiple Spark versions can coexist.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the separation of shuffle service configs into `spark-shuffle-site.xml` can be useful for administrators who want to change and/or deploy Spark shuffle service configurations independently of the configurations for the NodeManager (e.g., perhaps they are owned by two different teams).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. There are two new configurations related to the external shuffle service, and a new mechanism which can optionally be used to configure the shuffle service. `docs/running-on-yarn.md` has been updated to provide user instructions; please see this guide for more details.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nIn addition to the new unit tests added, I have deployed this to a live YARN cluster and successfully deployed two Spark shuffle services simultaneously, one running a modified version of Spark 2.3.0 (which supports some of the newer shuffle protocols) and one running Spark 3.1.1. Spark applications of both versions are able to communicate with their respective shuffle services without issue.","created_at":"2021-03-22T23:04:01Z","updated_at":"2021-03-30T16:49:48Z","closed_at":"2021-03-30T15:09:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a856f40be38cbd18bf82e1b4ca111402b0b6075","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31936/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31936/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31936/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ef880526e05b6143c31d98829d22d25cea659401","head":{"label":"xkrogen:xkrogen-SPARK-34828-shufflecompat-config-from-classpath","ref":"xkrogen-SPARK-34828-shufflecompat-config-from-classpath","sha":"ef880526e05b6143c31d98829d22d25cea659401","user":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":273605257,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzM2MDUyNTc=","name":"spark","full_name":"xkrogen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xkrogen","id":6570401,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzA0MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6570401?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen","html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xkrogen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xkrogen/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixes bugs that causes corruption of push-merged blocks when a client terminates while pushing block. `RemoteBlockPushResolver` was introduced in #30062 (SPARK-32916).\r\n\r\nThere are 2 scenarios where the merged blocks get corrupted:\r\n1. `StreamCallback.onFailure()` is called more than once. Initially we assumed that the onFailure callback will be called just once per stream. However, we observed that this is called twice when a client connection is reset. When the client connection is reset then there are 2 events that get triggered in this order.\r\n - `exceptionCaught`. This event is propagated to `StreamInterceptor`. `StreamInterceptor.exceptionCaught()` invokes `callback.onFailure(streamId, cause)`. This is the first time StreamCallback.onFailure() will be invoked.\r\n - `channelInactive`. Since the channel closes, the `channelInactive` event gets triggered which again is propagated to `StreamInterceptor`. `StreamInterceptor.channelInactive()` invokes `callback.onFailure(streamId, new ClosedChannelException())`. This is the second time  StreamCallback.onFailure() will be invoked.\r\n\r\n2. The flag `isWriting` is set prematurely to true. This introduces an edge case where a stream that is trying to merge a duplicate block (created because of a speculative task) may interfere with an active stream if the duplicate stream fails. \r\n\r\nAlso adding additional changes that improve the code.\r\n\r\n1.  Using positional writes all the time because this simplifies the code and with microbenchmarking haven't seen any performance impact.\r\n2. Additional minor changes suggested by @mridulm during an internal review.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese are bug fixes and simplify the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded unit tests. I have also tested these changes in Linkedin's internal fork on a cluster.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Chandni Singh chsingh@linkedin.com\r\nCo-authored-by: Min Shen

This PR refactors the `TreeNode` hierarchy by extracting the children handling functionality into the following traits. `UnaryExpression` and other similar classes now extend the corresponding new trait:\r\n```\r\ntrait LeafLike[T <: TreeNode[T]] { self: TreeNode[T] =>\r\n  override final def children: Seq[T] = Nil\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait UnaryLike[T <: TreeNode[T]] { self: TreeNode[T] =>\r\n  def child: T\r\n  @transient override final lazy val children: Seq[T] = child :: Nil\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait BinaryLike[T <: TreeNode[T]] { self: TreeNode[T] =>\r\n  def left: T\r\n  def right: T\r\n  @transient override final lazy val children: Seq[T] = left :: right :: Nil\r\n}\r\n\r\ntrait TernaryLike[T <: TreeNode[T]] { self: TreeNode[T] =>\r\n  def first: T\r\n  def second: T\r\n  def third: T\r\n  @transient override final lazy val children: Seq[T] = first :: second :: third :: Nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis refactoring, which is part of a bigger effort to make tree transformations in Spark more efficient, has two benefits:\r\n- It moves the children handling methods to a single place, instead of being spread in specific subclasses, which will help the future optimizations for tree traversals.\r\n- It allows to mix in these traits with some concrete node types that could not extend the previous classes. For example, expressions with one child that extend `AggregateFunction` cannot extend `UnaryExpression` as `AggregateFunction` defines the `foldable` method final while `UnaryExpression` defines it as non final. With the new traits, we can directly extend the concrete class from `UnaryLike` in these cases. Classes with more specific child handling will make tree traversal methods faster.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we have also updated many concrete node types to extend these traits to benefit from more specific child handling.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor permanent views (and the new SQL temp view in Spark 3.1), we store the view SQL text and re-parse/analyze the view SQL text when reading the view. In the case of `SELECT * FROM ...`, we want to avoid view schema change (e.g. the referenced table changes its schema) and will record the view query output column names when creating the view, so that when reading the view we can add a `SELECT recorded_column_names FROM ...` to retain the original view query schema.\r\n\r\nIn Spark 3.1 and before, the final SELECT is added after the analysis phase: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-3.1/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/view.scala#L67\r\n\r\nIf the view query has duplicated output column names, we always pick the first column when reading a view. A simple repro:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"create view c(x, y) as select 1 a, 2 a\")\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select * from c\").show\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  x|  y|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the master branch, we will fail at the view reading time due to https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/b891862fb6b740b103d5a09530626ee4e0e8f6e3 , which adds the final SELECT during analysis, so that the query fails with `Reference 'a' is ambiguous`\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to resolve the view query output column names from the matching attributes by ordinal.\r\n\r\nFor example,  `create view c(x, y) as select 1 a, 2 a`, the view query output column names are `[a, a]`. When we reading the view, there are 2 matching attributes (e.g.`[a#1, a#2]`) and we can simply match them by ordinal.\r\n\r\nA negative example is\r\n```\r\ncreate table t(a int)\r\ncreate view v as select *, 1 as col from t\r\nreplace table t(a int, col int)\r\n```\r\nWhen reading the view, the view query output column names are `[a, col]`, and there are two matching attributes of `col`, and we should fail the query. See the tests for details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Add new expression `MultiplyYMInterval` which multiplies a `YearMonthIntervalType` expression by a `NumericType` expression including ByteType, ShortType, IntegerType, LongType, FloatType, DoubleType, DecimalType.\r\n2. Extend binary arithmetic rules to support `numeric * year-month interval` and `year-month interval * numeric`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo conform the ANSI SQL standard which requires such operation over year-month intervals:\r\n<img width=\"667\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-03-22 at 16 33 16\"

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nMarked `RowNumberLike` and `RankLike` as not-nullable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`RowNumberLike` and `RankLike` SQL expressions never return null value. Marking them as non-nullable can have some performance benefits, because some optimizer rules apply only to non-nullable expressions\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Adds a new expression `GroupingExprRef` that can be used in aggregate expressions of `Aggregate` nodes to refer grouping expressions by index. These expressions capture the data type and nullability of the referred grouping expression.\r\n- Adds a new rule `EnforceGroupingReferencesInAggregates` that inserts the references in the beginning of the optimization phase.\r\n- Adds a new rule `UpdateGroupingExprRefNullability` to update nullability of `GroupingExprRef` expressions as nullability of referred grouping expression can change during optimization.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIf aggregate expressions (without aggregate functions) in an `Aggregate` node are complex then the `Optimizer` can optimize out grouping expressions from them and so making aggregate expressions invalid.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT not(t.id IS NULL) , count(*)\r\nFROM t\r\nGROUP BY t.id IS NULL\r\n```\r\nIn this case the `BooleanSimplification` rule does this:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.BooleanSimplification ===\r\n!Aggregate [isnull(id#222)], [NOT isnull(id#222) AS (NOT (id IS NULL))#226, count(1) AS c#224L]   Aggregate [isnull(id#222)], [isnotnull(id#222) AS (NOT (id IS NULL))#226, count(1) AS c#224L]\r\n +- Project [value#219 AS id#222]

+- LocalRelation [value#219]                                          \r\n```\r\nwhere `NOT isnull(id#222)` is optimized to `isnotnull(id#222)` and so it no longer refers to any grouping

This is because the limit counter variable will be used in upstream operators (LIMIT's child plan, e.g. `ColumnarToRowExec` operator for early termination), but in the same stage, there can be some operators doing the shortcut and not calling `BaseLimitExec`'s `doConsume()`, e.g. [HashJoin.codegenInner](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/joins/HashJoin.scala#L402). So if we have query that `LocalLimit - BroadcastHashJoin - FileScan` in the same stage, the whole stage code-gen compilation will be failed.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  test(\"failed limit query\") {\r\n    withTable(\"left_table\", \"empty_right_table\", \"output_table\") {\r\n      spark.range(5).toDF(\"k\").write.saveAsTable(\"left_table\")\r\n      spark.range(0).toDF(\"k\").write.saveAsTable(\"empty_right_table\")\r\n         \r\n      withSQLConf(SQLConf.ADAPTIVE_EXECUTION_ENABLED.key -> \"false\") {\r\n        spark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE output_table (k INT) USING parquet\")\r\n        spark.sql(\r\n          s\"\"\"\r\n             |INSERT INTO TABLE output_table\r\n             |SELECT t1.k FROM left_table t1\r\n             |JOIN empty_right_table t2\r\n             |ON t1.k = t2.k\r\n             |LIMIT 3\r\n             |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuery plan:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExecute InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQuerySuite/output_table, false, Parquet, Map(path -> file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQuerySuite/output_table), Append, CatalogTable(\r\nDatabase: default\r\nTable: output_table\r\nCreated Time: Thu Mar 18 21:46:26 PDT 2021\r\nLast Access: UNKNOWN\r\nCreated By: Spark 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT\r\nType: MANAGED\r\nProvider: parquet\r\nLocation: file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQuerySuite/output_table\r\nSchema: root\r\n |-- k: integer (nullable = true)\r\n), org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.InMemoryFileIndex@b25d08b, [k]\r\n+- *(3) Project [ansi_cast(k#228L as int) AS k#231]\r\n   +- *(3) GlobalLimit 3\r\n      +- Exchange SinglePartition, ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [id=#179]\r\n         +- *(2) LocalLimit 3\r\n            +- *(2) Project [k#228L]\r\n               +- *(2) BroadcastHashJoin [k#228L], [k#229L], Inner, BuildRight, false\r\n                  :- *(2) Filter isnotnull(k#228L)\r\n                  :  +- *(2) ColumnarToRow\r\n                  :     +- FileScan parquet default.left_table[k#228L] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(k#228L)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sq..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(k)], ReadSchema: struct<k:bigint>\r\n                  +- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(input[0, bigint, false]),false), [id=#173]\r\n                     +- *(1) Filter isnotnull(k#229L)\r\n                        +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n                           +- FileScan parquet default.empty_right_table[k#229L] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(k#229L)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sq..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(k)], ReadSchema: struct<k:bigint>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCodegen failure - https://gist.github.com/c21/ea760c75b546d903247582be656d9d66 .\r\n\r\nThe uninitialized variable `_limit_counter_1` from `LocalLimitExec` is referenced in `ColumnarToRowExec`, but `BroadcastHashJoinExec` does not call `LocalLimitExec.doConsume()` to initialize the counter variable.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to move the counter variable initialization to `doProduce()`, as in whole stage code-gen framework, `doProduce()` will definitely be called if upstream operators `doProduce()`/`doConsume()` is called.\r\n\r\nNote: this only happens in AQE disabled case, because we have an AQE optimization rule [EliminateUnnecessaryJoin](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/EliminateUnnecessaryJoin.scala#L69) to change the whole query to an empty `LocalRelation` if inner join broadcast side is empty with AQE enabled.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nNow that all the temporary views are wrapped with `TemporaryViewRelation`(#31273, #31652, and #31825), this PR proposes to update `SessionCatalog`'s APIs for temporary views to take or return more concrete types.\r\n\r\nAPIs that will take `TemporaryViewRelation` instead of `LogicalPlan`:\r\n```\r\ncreateTempView, createGlobalTempView, alterTempViewDefinition\r\n```\r\n\r\nAPIs that will return `TemporaryViewRelation` instead of `LogicalPlan`:\r\n```\r\ngetRawTempView, getRawGlobalTempView\r\n```\r\n\r\nAPIs that will return `View` instead of `LogicalPlan`:\r\n```\r\ngetTempView, getGlobalTempView, lookupTempView\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nInternal refactoring to work with more concrete types.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, this is internal refactoring.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nUpdated existing tests affected by the refactoring.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-19T22:57:34Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T08:18:08Z","closed_at":"2021-03-22T08:18:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f87c017d953daab09c9030b7bedd02a34b6c34ff","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31906/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31906/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31906/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd9480c17ee13defe25a80c7addb778901b480f7","head":{"label":"imback82:use_temporary_view_relation","ref":"use_temporary_view_relation","sha":"fd9480c17ee13defe25a80c7addb778901b480f7","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pull request introduces a helper class that simplifies usage of `Dataset.observe()` for batch datasets:\r\n\r\n    val observation = Observation(\"name\")\r\n    val observed = ds.observe(observation, max($\"id\").as(\"max_id\"))\r\n    observed.count()\r\n    val metrics = observation.get\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, users are required to implement the `QueryExecutionListener` interface to retrieve the metrics, as well as apply some knowledge on threading and locking to pull the metrics over to the main thread. With the helper class, metrics can be retrieved from batch dataset processing with three lines of code (the action on the observed dataset does not count as a line of code here).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, one new class and one `Dataset`` method.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdds a unit test to `DataFrameSuite`, similar to `\"get observable metrics by callback\"` in `DataFrameCallbackSuite`.","created_at":"2021-03-19T22:02:22Z","updated_at":"2021-07-19T15:11:03Z","closed_at":"2021-07-19T09:16:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fc3f8dfcf073946722e4bd133cd64a7060ffc7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31905/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31905/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31905/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec7f7275ca7902db83aef86d174890bd1e240fe7","head":{"label":"G-Research:branch-observation","ref":"branch-observation","sha":"ec7f7275ca7902db83aef86d174890bd1e240fe7","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPass the raised `ImportError` on failing to import pandas/pyarrow. This will help the user identify whether pandas/pyarrow are indeed not in the environment or if they threw a different `ImportError`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis can already happen in Pandas for example where it could throw an `ImportError` on its initialisation path if `dateutil` doesn't satisfy a certain version requirement https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/0.24.x/pandas/compat/__init__.py#L438\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it will now show the root cause of the exception when pandas or arrow is missing during import.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nthe given example uses a non-standard syntax for CREATE TABLE, by defining the partitioning column with the other columns, instead of in PARTITION BY.\r\n\r\nThis works is this case, because the partitioning column happens to be the last column defined, but it will break if instead 'name' would be used for partitioning.\r\n\r\nI suggest therefore to change the example to use a standard syntax, like in \r\nhttps://spark.apache.org/docs/3.1.1/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-hiveformat.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo show the better documentation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this fixes the user-facing docs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCI should test it out.","created_at":"2021-03-19T15:26:09Z","updated_at":"2021-03-23T17:21:08Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T15:13:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b41168f58cd701981941e22123bad16e3e57184b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31900/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31900/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31900/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8a955f637c9f7d1f0e6664f4484447e035d5925c","head":{"label":"robert4os:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"8a955f637c9f7d1f0e6664f4484447e035d5925c","user":{"login":"robert4os","id":1668298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjgyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1668298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os","html_url":"https://github.com/robert4os","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349465513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk0NjU1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"robert4os/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"robert4os","id":1668298,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjgyOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1668298?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os","html_url":"https://github.com/robert4os","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/robert4os/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/robert4os/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis change updates the documentation for several table DDLs (e.g. [Create Table DDL Datasource](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-datasource.html),  [Create Table DDL Hiveformat](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-hiveformat.html),  [Create Table DDL Like](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-like.html)) to reflect the alternative notation of key-value pairs `( key1 [=] val1, key2 [=] val2, ... )`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nDocumentation update to reflect alternative notation\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, the previous documentation did not account for the alternative notation of key value pairs.\r\n\r\nExample for  [Create Table DDL Datasource](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-datasource.html)\r\nPrevious:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_identifier\r\n    [ ( col_name1 col_type1 [ COMMENT col_comment1 ], ... ) ]\r\n    USING data_source\r\n    [ OPTIONS ( key1=val1, key2=val2, ... ) ]\r\n    [ PARTITIONED BY ( col_name1, col_name2, ... ) ]\r\n    [ CLUSTERED BY ( col_name3, col_name4, ... ) \r\n        [ SORTED BY ( col_name [ ASC | DESC ], ... ) ] \r\n        INTO num_buckets BUCKETS ]\r\n    [ LOCATION path ]\r\n    [ COMMENT table_comment ]\r\n    [ TBLPROPERTIES ( key1=val1, key2=val2, ... ) ]\r\n    [ AS select_statement ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_identifier\r\n    [ ( col_name1 col_type1 [ COMMENT col_comment1 ], ... ) ]\r\n    USING data_source\r\n    [ OPTIONS  ( key1 [=] val1, key2 [=] val2, ... ) ]\r\n    [ PARTITIONED BY ( col_name1, col_name2, ... ) ]\r\n    [ CLUSTERED BY ( col_name3, col_name4, ... ) \r\n        [ SORTED BY ( col_name [ ASC | DESC ], ... ) ] \r\n        INTO num_buckets BUCKETS ]\r\n    [ LOCATION path ]\r\n    [ COMMENT table_comment ]\r\n    [ TBLPROPERTIES ( key1 [=] val1, key2 [=] val2, ... ) ]\r\n    [ AS select_statement ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNo tests because it was just a documentation

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to disable fetching shuffle blocks in batch when io encryption is enabled. Adaptive Query Execution fetch contiguous shuffle blocks for the same map task in batch to reduce IO and improve performance. However, we found that batch fetching is incompatible with io encryption. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore this patch, we set `spark.io.encryption.enabled` to true, then run some queries which coalesced partitions by AEQ, may got following error message:\r\n```14:05:52.638 WARN org.apache.spark.scheduler.TaskSetManager: Lost task 1.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 3) (11.240.37.88 executor

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd the support to submit applications to the user-defined cluster manager.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWe have supported users to define the customed cluster manager with ExternalClusterManager trait. However, we can not submit the application with SparkSubmit. The reason is that we check the master whether is the natively support one in SparkSubmit. However, the customed cluster manager is checked in SparkContext. So we could not submit applications with \r\n`SparkSubmit` or pyspark to those user-defined cluster managers.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we extend the existed plugin: `SparkSubmitOperations` to support customize of the submit operation. This makes the `SparkSubmitOperations` a developer API. And decouple the current spark submit preparing code into subclass which makes it easier for maintaining.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

For example, the current thrift server module test in Github action workflow outputs more than 200MB of data for this error only\r\n```java\r\norg.apache.thrift.transport.TTransportException\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.transport.TIOStreamTransport.read(TIOStreamTransport.java:132)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport.readAll(TTransport.java:86)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.transport.TSaslTransport.readLength(TSaslTransport.java:374)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.transport.TSaslTransport.readFrame(TSaslTransport.java:451)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.transport.TSaslTransport.read(TSaslTransport.java:433)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.transport.TSaslServerTransport.read(TSaslServerTransport.java:43)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.transport.TTransport.readAll(TTransport.java:86)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol.readAll(TBinaryProtocol.java:425)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol.readI32(TBinaryProtocol.java:321)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.protocol.TBinaryProtocol.readMessageBegin(TBinaryProtocol.java:225)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.TBaseProcessor.process(TBaseProcessor.java:27)\r\n\tat org.apache.hive.service.auth.TSetIpAddressProcessor.process(TSetIpAddressProcessor.java:53)\r\n\tat org.apache.thrift.server.TThreadPoolServer$WorkerProcess.run(TThreadPoolServer.java:310)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI checked the latest `hive-service-rpc` module in the maven center,  https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hive/hive-service-rpc/3.1.2. \b It still uses the 0.9.3 version. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I tried the newly released `libthrift 0.14.1`(w/o shading it), it breaks the metastore client side.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\njava.lang.NoSuchMethodError: org.apache.thrift.transport.TSocket.<init>(Ljava/lang/String;II)V\r\n```\r\nOn the Thrift side, they just muted it see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-4805 \r\n\r\nSo in this PR, I add a filter to suppress the warning\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor permanent views (and the new SQL temp view in Spark 3.1), we store the view SQL text and re-parse/analyze the view SQL text when reading the view. In the case of `SELECT * FROM ...`, we want to avoid view schema change (e.g. the referenced table changes its schema) and will record the view query output column names when creating the view, so that when reading the view we can add a `SELECT recorded_column_names FROM ...` to retain the original view query schema.\r\n\r\nIn Spark 3.1 and before, the final SELECT is added after the analysis phase: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-3.1/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/analysis/view.scala#L67\r\n\r\nIf the view query has duplicated output column names, we always pick the first column when reading a view. A simple repro:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(\"create view c(x, y) as select 1 a, 2 a\")\r\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = []\r\n\r\nscala> sql(\"select * from c\").show\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  x|  y|\r\n+---+---+\r\n|  1|  1|\r\n+---+---+\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the master branch, we will fail at the view reading time due to https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/b891862fb6b740b103d5a09530626ee4e0e8f6e3 , which adds the final SELECT during analysis, so that the query fails with `Reference 'a' is ambiguous`\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to resolve the view query output column names from the matching attributes by ordinal.\r\n\r\nFor example,  `create view c(x, y) as select 1 a, 2 a`, the view query output column names are `[a, a]`. When we reading the view, there are 2 matching attributes (e.g.`[a#1, a#2]`) and we can simply match them by ordinal.\r\n\r\nA negative example is\r\n```\r\ncreate table t(a int)\r\ncreate view v as select *, 1 as col from t\r\nreplace table t(a int, col int)\r\n```\r\nWhen reading the view, the view query output column names are `[a, col]`, and there are two matching attributes of `col`, and we should fail the query. See the tests for details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

This is because the limit counter variable will be used in upstream operators (LIMIT's child plan, e.g. `ColumnarToRowExec` operator for early termination), but in the same stage, there can be some operators doing the shortcut and not calling `BaseLimitExec`'s `doConsume()`, e.g. [HashJoin.codegenInner](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/joins/HashJoin.scala#L402). So if we have query that `LocalLimit - BroadcastHashJoin - FileScan` in the same stage, the whole stage code-gen compilation will be failed.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  test(\"failed limit query\") {\r\n    withTable(\"left_table\", \"empty_right_table\", \"output_table\") {\r\n      spark.range(5).toDF(\"k\").write.saveAsTable(\"left_table\")\r\n      spark.range(0).toDF(\"k\").write.saveAsTable(\"empty_right_table\")\r\n         \r\n      withSQLConf(SQLConf.ADAPTIVE_EXECUTION_ENABLED.key -> \"false\") {\r\n        spark.sql(\"CREATE TABLE output_table (k INT) USING parquet\")\r\n        spark.sql(\r\n          s\"\"\"\r\n             |INSERT INTO TABLE output_table\r\n             |SELECT t1.k FROM left_table t1\r\n             |JOIN empty_right_table t2\r\n             |ON t1.k = t2.k\r\n             |LIMIT 3\r\n             |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuery plan:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExecute InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQuerySuite/output_table, false, Parquet, Map(path -> file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQuerySuite/output_table), Append, CatalogTable(\r\nDatabase: default\r\nTable: output_table\r\nCreated Time: Thu Mar 18 21:46:26 PDT 2021\r\nLast Access: UNKNOWN\r\nCreated By: Spark 3.2.0-SNAPSHOT\r\nType: MANAGED\r\nProvider: parquet\r\nLocation: file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQuerySuite/output_table\r\nSchema: root\r\n |-- k: integer (nullable = true)\r\n), org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.InMemoryFileIndex@b25d08b, [k]\r\n+- *(3) Project [ansi_cast(k#228L as int) AS k#231]\r\n   +- *(3) GlobalLimit 3\r\n      +- Exchange SinglePartition, ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [id=#179]\r\n         +- *(2) LocalLimit 3\r\n            +- *(2) Project [k#228L]\r\n               +- *(2) BroadcastHashJoin [k#228L], [k#229L], Inner, BuildRight, false\r\n                  :- *(2) Filter isnotnull(k#228L)\r\n                  :  +- *(2) ColumnarToRow\r\n                  :     +- FileScan parquet default.left_table[k#228L] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(k#228L)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sq..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(k)], ReadSchema: struct<k:bigint>\r\n                  +- BroadcastExchange HashedRelationBroadcastMode(List(input[0, bigint, false]),false), [id=#173]\r\n                     +- *(1) Filter isnotnull(k#229L)\r\n                        +- *(1) ColumnarToRow\r\n                           +- FileScan parquet default.empty_right_table[k#229L] Batched: true, DataFilters: [isnotnull(k#229L)], Format: Parquet, Location: InMemoryFileIndex(1 paths)[file:/Users/chengsu/spark/sql/core/spark-warehouse/org.apache.spark.sq..., PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [IsNotNull(k)], ReadSchema: struct<k:bigint>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCodegen failure - https://gist.github.com/c21/ea760c75b546d903247582be656d9d66 .\r\n\r\nThe uninitialized variable `_limit_counter_1` from `LocalLimitExec` is referenced in `ColumnarToRowExec`, but `BroadcastHashJoinExec` does not call `LocalLimitExec.doConsume()` to initialize the counter variable.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to move the counter variable initialization to `doProduce()`, as in whole stage code-gen framework, `doProduce()` will definitely be called if upstream operators `doProduce()`/`doConsume()` is called.\r\n\r\nNote: this only happens in AQE disabled case, because we have an AQE optimization rule [EliminateUnnecessaryJoin](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/adaptive/EliminateUnnecessaryJoin.scala#L69) to change the whole query to an empty `LocalRelation` if inner join broadcast side is empty with AQE enabled.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix query failure.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse fine-grained lock in SessionCatalog.tableExists, in order to lock currentDB variable rather than lock `tableExists` method which will block inner external catalog's behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe have modified the underlying hive meta store which a different hive  database is placed in its own shard for performance. However, we found that the synchronized lock  limits the concurrency.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUse `Utils.getSimpleName` to avoid hitting `Malformed class name` error in `NewInstance.doGenCode`.\r\n\r\nNOTE: branch-2.4 does not have the interpreted implementation of `SafeProjection`, so it does not fall back into the interpreted mode if the compilation fails. Therefore, the test in this PR just checks that the compilation error happens instead of checking that the interpreted mode works well.\r\n\r\nThis is the backport PR of #31709 and the credit should be @rednaxelafx .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nOn older JDK versions (e.g. JDK8u), nested Scala classes may trigger `java.lang.Class.getSimpleName` to throw an `java.lang.InternalError: Malformed class name` error.\r\nIn this particular case, creating an `ExpressionEncoder` on such a nested Scala class would create a `NewInstance` expression under the hood, which will trigger the problem during codegen.\r\n\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29050, we should use  Spark's `Utils.getSimpleName` utility function in place of `Class.getSimpleName` to avoid hitting the issue.\r\n\r\nThere are two other occurrences of `java.lang.Class.getSimpleName` in the same file, but they're safe because they're only guaranteed to be only used on Java classes, which don't have this problem, e.g.:\r\n```scala\r\n    // Make a copy of the data if it's unsafe-backed\r\n    def makeCopyIfInstanceOf(clazz: Class[_ <: Any], value: String) =\r\n      s\"$value instanceof ${clazz.getSimpleName}? ${value}.copy() : $value\"\r\n    val genFunctionValue: String = lambdaFunction.dataType match {\r\n      case StructType(_) => makeCopyIfInstanceOf(classOf[UnsafeRow], genFunction.value)\r\n      case ArrayType(_, _) => makeCopyIfInstanceOf(classOf[UnsafeArrayData], genFunction.value)\r\n      case MapType(_, _, _) => makeCopyIfInstanceOf(classOf[UnsafeMapData], genFunction.value)\r\n      case _ => genFunction.value\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThe Unsafe-* family of types are all Java types, so they're okay.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a bug that throws an error when using `ExpressionEncoder` on some nested Scala types, otherwise no changes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a test case to `org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.encoders.ExpressionEncoderSuite`. It'll fail on JDK8u before the fix, and pass after the

If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIncrement a global counter and use the current value to name LambdaVariables created by higher order functions.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n This moves away from the current hard-coded variable names which break on nested function calls. There is currently a bug where nested transforms in particular fail (the inner variable shadows the outer variable)\r\n\r\nFor this query:\r\n```\r\nval df = Seq(\r\n    (Seq(1,2,3), Seq(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"))\r\n).toDF(\"numbers\", \"letters\")\r\n\r\ndf.select(\r\n    f.flatten(\r\n        f.transform(\r\n            $\"numbers\",\r\n            (number: Column) => { f.transform(\r\n                $\"letters\",\r\n                (letter: Column) => { f.struct(\r\n                    number.as(\"number\"),\r\n                    letter.as(\"letter\")\r\n                ) }\r\n            ) }\r\n        )\r\n    ).as(\"zipped\")\r\n).show(10, false)\r\n```\r\nThis is the current (incorrect) output:\r\n```\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|zipped                                                                  |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[{a, a}, {b, b}, {c, c}, {a, a}, {b, b}, {c, c}, {a, a}, {b, b}, {c, c}]|\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\nAnd this is the correct output after fix:\r\n```\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|zipped                                                                  |\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|[{1, a}, {1, b}, {1, c}, {2, a}, {2, b}, {2, c}, {3, a}, {3, b}, {3, c}]|\r\n+------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI'm not sure how to test this because the current tests don't run the `functions.transform` directly\r\n\r\n@nvander1 @RussellSpitzer

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to add a new job in GitHub Actions to check the output of TPC-DS queries.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I've checked that the new job took 17m 35s in the GitHub Actions env.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere are some cases where we noticed runtime-realted bugs after merging commits (e.g. .SPARK-33822). Therefore, I think it is worth adding a new job in GitHub Actions to check query output of TPC-DS (sf=1).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nThe new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an incompatible behavior introduced by #31754.\r\nThe problem is that quoted name parts represented as a string are given to the constructor of `UnresolvedAttribute` which takes single string parameter, `sql` method invocation against the `UnresolvedAttrribute` returns different result than before.\r\n\r\nOne example is ``` UnresolvedAttribute(\"`a.b`\").sql ```. This  returned `a.b` before but it doesn't now.\r\n\r\nSee [this duscussion](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31754/files#r597181927) for more details.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor all built-in datasources, prohibit saving of year-month and day-time intervals that were introduced by SPARK-27793. We plan to support saving of such types at the milestone 2, see SPARK-27790. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL, and print nicer error message. Current error message might confuse users:\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq(java.time.Period.ofMonths(1)).toDF.write.mode(\"overwrite\").json(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/123\")\r\n21/03/18 22:44:35 ERROR FileFormatWriter: Aborting job 8de402d7-ab69-4dc0-aa8e-14ef06bd2d6b.\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 1.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 1.0 (TID 1) (192.168.1.66 executor driver): org.apache.spark.SparkException: Task failed while writing rows.\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.errors.QueryExecutionErrors$.taskFailedWhileWritingRowsError(QueryExecutionErrors.scala:418)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileFormatWriter$.executeTask(FileFormatWriter.scala:298)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.FileFormatWriter$.$anonfun$write$15(FileFormatWriter.scala:211)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.ResultTask.runTask(ResultTask.scala:90)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.scheduler.Task.run(Task.scala:131)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.$anonfun$run$3(Executor.scala:498)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.tryWithSafeFinally(Utils.scala:1437)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.executor.Executor$TaskRunner.run(Executor.scala:501)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to convert value 1 (class of class java.lang.Integer}) with the type of YearMonthIntervalType to JSON.\r\n\tat scala.sys.package$.error(package.scala:30)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.json.JacksonGenerator.$anonfun$makeWriter$23(JacksonGenerator.scala:179)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.json.JacksonGenerator.$anonfun$makeWriter$23$adapted(JacksonGenerator.scala:176)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes, the example above:\r\n```\r\nscala> Seq(java.time.Period.ofMonths(1)).toDF.write.mode(\"overwrite\").json(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/123\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Cannot save interval data type into external storage.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Checked nested intervals:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"\"\"struct(timestamp'2021-01-02 00:01:02' - timestamp'2021-01-01 00:00:00')\"\"\").write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/123\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Cannot save interval data type into external storage.\r\nscala> Seq(Seq(java.time.Period.ofMonths(1))).toDF.write.mode(\"overwrite\").json(\"/Users/maximgekk/tmp/123\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Cannot save interval data type into external storage.\r\n```\r\n2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes an alternative way to fix the memory leak of `ExecutionListenerBus`, which would automatically clean them up.\r\n\r\nBasically, the idea is to add `registerSparkListenerForCleanup` to `ContextCleaner`, so we can remove the `ExecutionListenerBus` from `LiveListenerBus` when the `SparkSession` is GC'ed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to make the `SparkSession` GC-able, we need to get rid of the reference of `SparkSession` in `ExecutionListenerBus`. Therefore, we introduced the `sessionUUID`, which is a unique identifier for SparkSession, to replace the  `SparkSession` object.\r\n\r\nNote that, the proposal wouldn't take effect when `spark.cleaner.referenceTracking=false` since it depends on `ContextCleaner`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo fix the issue with more proper way.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed build succeed with the following procedure.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfind ~/.m2 -name commons-cli -exec rm -rf {} \\;\r\nfind ~/.ivy2

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes (mentioned in #30763) to abstract the `location` (which is specified to `BlockManagerId` now) in `MapStatus` to a base class `Location`, in order to support custom storages, e.g., HDFS, S3. Custom storages can implement their own `Location`s to provide some specific information. So custom shuffle readers can use their own location to fetch shuffle blocks.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to give a whole picture of the real impact to the default storage (`BlockManager`) with the `abstraction` and let people discuss precisely on codes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-18T03:05:37Z","updated_at":"2022-02-16T19:33:44Z","closed_at":"2021-09-17T00:09:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5593a1d32b991de0103c19633bbc7471caf98ced","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31876/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31876/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31876/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/02b51bf6d400c68ea6b9ad56241318c393f51bfb","head":{"label":"Ngone51:abstract-mapstatus-location","ref":"abstract-mapstatus-location","sha":"02b51bf6d400c68ea6b9ad56241318c393f51bfb","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn `EliminateJoinToEmptyRelation.scala`, we can extend it to cover more cases for LEFT SEMI and LEFT ANI joins:\r\n\r\n* Join is left semi join, join right side is non-empty and condition is empty. Eliminate join to its left side.\r\n* Join is left anti join, join right side is empty. Eliminate join to its left side.\r\n\r\nGiven we eliminate join to its left side here, renaming the current optimization rule to `EliminateUnnecessaryJoin` instead.\r\nIn addition, also change to use `checkRowCount()` to check run time row count, instead of using `EmptyHashedRelation`. So this can cover `BroadcastNestedLoopJoin` as well. (`BroadcastNestedLoopJoin`'s broadcast side is `Array[InternalRow]`, not `HashedRelation`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCover more join cases, and improve query performance for affected queries.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests in `AdaptiveQueryExecSuite.scala`.","created_at":"2021-03-17T21:57:13Z","updated_at":"2021-03-19T00:49:53Z","closed_at":"2021-03-19T00:42:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4201a217027bc72708aa49fb11d8cc9d86aa02de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31873/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31873/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31873/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7f7f3347efe267e9f75c166c8fe98ef09a204db7","head":{"label":"c21:aqe-join","ref":"aqe-join","sha":"7f7f3347efe267e9f75c166c8fe98ef09a204db7","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to cast the input float to double in the `SecondsToTimestamp` expression in the same way as in the `Cast` expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo have the same results from `CAST(<float> AS TIMESTAMP)` and from `TIMESTAMP_SECONDS`:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT CAST(16777215.0f AS TIMESTAMP);\r\n1970-07-14 07:20:15\r\nspark-sql> SELECT TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(16777215.0f);\r\n1970-07-14 07:20:14.951424\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. After the changes:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(16777215.0f);\r\n1970-07-14 07:20:15\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAllow ExecutorMetricsPoller to keep stage entries in stageTCMP until a heartbeat occurs even if the entries have task count = 0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is an improvement.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of ExecutorMetricsPoller keeps a map, stageTCMP of (stageId, stageAttemptId) to (count of running tasks, executor metric peaks). The entry for the stage is removed on task completion if the task count decreases to 0. In the case of an executor with a single core, this leads to unnecessary removal and insertion of entries for a given stage.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nA new unit test is added.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-17T17:53:44Z","updated_at":"2022-09-29T22:30:20Z","closed_at":"2021-04-02T05:14:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"592c8aaf364ba39682801f78ea8ad1fe9da2886c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31871/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31871/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31871/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2751c75f594429a0d90c27d784c030a5fa847eed","head":{"label":"baohe-zhang:SPARK-34779","ref":"SPARK-34779","sha":"2751c75f594429a0d90c27d784c030a5fa847eed","user":{"login":"baohe-zhang","id":26694233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njk0MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26694233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/baohe-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":256324311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTYzMjQzMTE=","name":"spark","full_name":"baohe-zhang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"baohe-zhang","id":26694233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2Njk0MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26694233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/baohe-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/baohe-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/baohe-zhang/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes an issue that If we change the Scala version to `2.13` and then change the version to `2.12` using `change-scala-version.sh`, it fails to modify `pom.xml` and fails to build.\r\n\r\nThe reason seems that the following logic never be able to fetch `2.12.0` from `pom.xml` after it changes `2.13.5`.\r\n```\r\n# Update <scala.version> in parent POM\r\n# First find the right full version from the profile's build\r\nSCALA_VERSION=`build/mvn help:evaluate -Pscala-${TO_VERSION} -Dexpression=scala.version -q -DforceStdout`\r\nsed_i '1,/<scala\\.version>[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*</s/<scala\\.version>[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*</<scala.version>'$SCALA_VERSION'</' \\\r\n  \"$BASEDIR/pom.xml\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurther, I don't think this logic and the following logic are necessary because those versions are changed by `-Pscala-2.13` if we'd like to build with Scala 2.13.\r\n```\r\n# Also update <scala.binary.version> in parent POM\r\n# Match any scala binary version to ensure idempotency\r\nsed_i '1,/<scala\\.binary\\.version>[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*</s/<scala\\.binary\\.version>[0-9]*\\.[0-9]*</<scala.binary.version>'$TO_VERSION'</' \\\r\n  \"$BASEDIR/pom.xml\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I removed them to fix this issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's inconvenient if we'd like to change the version back to `2.12` in development.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed build for Scala 2.13 and 2.12 successfully finishes with both sbt and Maven.\r\n```\r\n./dev/change-scala-version

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes the build failure with Scala 2.13 which is related to `commons-cli`.\r\nThe last few days, build with Scala 2.13 on GA continues to fail and the error message says like as follows.\r\n```\r\n[error] /home/runner/work/spark/spark/sql/hive-thriftserver/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/service/server/HiveServer2.java:26:1:  error: package org.apache.commons.cli does not exist\r\n1278[error] import org.apache.commons.cli.GnuParser;\r\n```\r\nThe reason is that `mvn help` in `change-scala-version.sh` downloads the POM file of `commons-cli` but doesn't download the JAR file, leading the build failure.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds `commons-cli` to the dependencies explicitly because HiveThriftServer depends on it.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nExpect to fix the build failure with Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nI confirmed that build successfully finishes with Scala 2.13 on my laptop.\r\n```\r\nfind ~/.m2 -name commons-cli -exec rm -rf {}

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, when implicit casting a data type to a `TypeCollection`, Spark returns the first convertible data type among `TypeCollection`.\r\nIn ANSI mode, we can make the behavior more reasonable by returning the closet convertible data type in `TypeCollection`.\r\n\r\nIn details, we first try to find the all the expected types we can implicitly cast:\r\n1. if there is no convertible data types, return None;\r\n2. if there is only one convertible data type, cast input as it;\r\n3. otherwise if there are multiple convertible data types, find the closet data\r\ntype among them. If there is no such closet data type, return None.\r\n\r\nNote that if the closet type is Float type and the convertible types contains Double type, simply return Double type as the closet type to avoid potential\r\nprecision loss on converting the Integral type as Float type.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake the type coercion rule for TypeCollection more reasonable and ANSI compatible.\r\nE.g. returning Long instead of Double for`implicast(int, TypeCollect(Double, Long))`.\r\n\r\nFrom ANSI SQL Spec section 4.33 \"SQL-invoked routines\"\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-03-17 at 4 05 06 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/111434916-5e104e80-86bd-11eb-8b3b-33090a68067d.png)\r\n\r\nSection 9.6 \"Subject routine determination\"\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-03-17 at 1 36 55 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/111420336-48445e80-86a8-11eb-9d50-34b325043bdb.png)\r\n\r\nSection 10.4 \"routine invocation\"\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-03-17 at 4 08 41 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1097932/111434926-610b3f00-86bd-11eb-8c32-8c7935e055da.png)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, in ANSI mode, implicit casting to a `TypeCollection` returns the narrowest convertible data type instead of the first convertible one.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to follow Univocity's input buffer.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Firstly, it's best to trust their judgement on the default values. Also 128 is too low.\r\n- Default values arguably have more test coverage in Univocity.\r\n- It will also fix https://github.com/uniVocity/univocity-parsers/issues/449\r\n- ^ is a regression compared to Spark 2.4\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. In addition, It fixes a regression.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, and added a unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport `timestamp +/- day-time interval`. In the PR, I propose to extend the `TimeAdd` expression and support `DayTimeIntervalType` as the `interval` parameter. The expression invokes the new method `DateTimeUtils.timestampAddDayTime()` which splits the input day-time interval to `days` and `microsecond adjustment` of a day, and adds `days` (and the microseconds) to a local timestamp derived from the given timestamp at the given time zone.  The resulted local timestamp is converted back to the offset in microseconds since the epoch.\r\n\r\nAlso I updated the rules that handle `CalendarIntervalType` and produce `TimeAdd` to take into account new type `DateTimeIntervalType` for the `interval` parameter of `TimeAdd`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo conform the ANSI SQL standard which requires to support such operation over timestamps and intervals:\r\n<img width=\"811\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-03-12 at 11 36 14\"

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor DDL commands like DROP VIEW, they don't really need to resolve the view (parse and analyze the view SQL text), they just need to get the view metadata.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the rule `ResolveTempViews` to only resolve the temp view for `UnresolvedRelation`. This also fixes a bug for DROP VIEW, as previously it tried to resolve the view and failed to drop invalid views.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4.

The `state.close()` will delete them if they are not null and try remove them from the `o.a.h.u.ShutdownHookManager` which causes IllegalStateException when we call it in our ShutdownHookManager too.\r\nIn this PR, we delete them ahead with a high priority hook in Spark and set them to null to bypass the deletion and canceling in `state.close()`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nW/ or w/o this PR, the deletion of these files is not affected, we just mute an undesirable error log here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno, this is a follow-up\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n#### the undesirable gone\r\n```scala\r\nspark-sql> 21/03/16 18:41:31 ERROR Utils: Uncaught exception in thread shutdown-hook-0\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Shutdown in progress, cannot cancel a deleteOnExit\r\n\tat org.apache.hive.common.util.ShutdownHookManager.cancelDeleteOnExit(ShutdownHookManager.java:106)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.common.FileUtils.deleteTmpFile(FileUtils.java:861)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.session.SessionState.deleteTmpErrOutputFile(SessionState.java:325)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.session.SessionState.dropSessionPaths(SessionState.java:829)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.session.SessionState.close(SessionState.java:1585)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.CliSessionState.close(CliSessionState.java:66)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl.closeState(HiveClientImpl.scala:172)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.hive.client.HiveClientImpl.$anonfun$new$1(HiveClientImpl.scala:175)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.SparkShutdownHook.run(ShutdownHookManager.scala:214)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.SparkShutdownHookManager.$anonfun$runAll$2(ShutdownHookManager.scala:188)\r\n\tat scala.runtime.java8.JFunction0$mcV$sp.apply(JFunction0$mcV$sp.java:23)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.logUncaughtExceptions(Utils.scala:1994)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.SparkShutdownHookManager.$anonfun$runAll$1(ShutdownHookManager.scala:188)\r\n\tat scala.runtime.java8.JFunction0$mcV$sp.apply(JFunction0$mcV$sp.java:23)\r\n\tat scala.util.Try$.apply(Try.scala:213)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.SparkShutdownHookManager.runAll(ShutdownHookManager.scala:188)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.util.SparkShutdownHookManager$$anon$2.run(ShutdownHookManager.scala:178)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748)\r\n(python)  ✘ kentyao@hulk  ~/Downloads/spark/spark-3.2.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-20210316  cd ..\r\n(python)  kentyao@hulk  ~/Downloads/spark  tar zxf spark-3.2.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-20210316.tgz\r\n(python)  kentyao@hulk  ~/Downloads/spark  cd -\r\n~/Downloads/spark/spark-3.2.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-20210316\r\n(python)  kentyao@hulk  ~/Downloads/spark/spark-3.2.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-20210316  bin/spark-sql --conf spark.local.dir=./local --conf spark.hive.exec.local.scratchdir=./local\r\n21/03/16 18:42:15 WARN Utils: Your hostname, hulk.local resolves to a loopback address: 127.0.0.1; using 10.242.189.214 instead (on interface en0)\r\n21/03/16 18:42:15 WARN Utils: Set SPARK_LOCAL_IP if you need to bind to another address\r\nUsing Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties\r\nSetting default log level to \"WARN\".\r\nTo adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change is to ignore cache for SNAPSHOT dependencies in spark-submit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen spark-submit is executed with --packages, it will not download the dependency jars when they are available in cache (e.g. ivy cache), even when the dependencies are SNAPSHOT.\r\n\r\nThis might block developers who work on external modules in Spark (e.g. spark-avro), since they need to remove the cache manually every time when they update the code during developments (which generates SNAPSHOT jars). Without knowing this, they could be blocked wondering why their code changes are not reflected in spark-submit executions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes. With this change, developers/users who run spark-submit with SNAPSHOT dependencies do not need to remove the cache every time when the SNAPSHOT dependencies are updated.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-16T09:43:11Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T02:45:11Z","closed_at":"2021-03-18T06:32:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d10539970cfd6398167df0a5023e26d10064340c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31849/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31849/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31849/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2e8d869e28adfbdc5d54517199005dc21e0d9b9e","head":{"label":"bozhang2820:spark-submit-cache-ignore","ref":"spark-submit-cache-ignore","sha":"2e8d869e28adfbdc5d54517199005dc21e0d9b9e","user":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":295316675,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTUzMTY2NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"bozhang2820/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bozhang2820","id":44179472,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTc5NDcy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44179472?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820","html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bozhang2820/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bozhang2820/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis bug was introduced by SPARK-30428 at Apache Spark 3.0.0.\r\nThis PR fixes `FileScan.equals()`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Without this fix `FileScan.equals` doesn't take `fileIndex` and `readSchema` into account.\r\n- Partition filters and data filters added to `FileScan` (in #27112 and #27157) caused that canonicalized form of some `BatchScanExec` nodes don't match and this prevents some reuse possibilities.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, before this fix incorrect reuse of `FileScan` and so `BatchScanExec` could have happed causing correctness issues.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs.\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-16T08:30:42Z","updated_at":"2021-03-24T09:19:38Z","closed_at":"2021-03-23T09:01:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"60cab3c71ca2ab7b131c779939105afb8fb38f2d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1988040187,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg4MDQwMTg3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/AVRO","name":"AVRO","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31848/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31848/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31848/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0d38ac27dec27b77e0057113fbb57de8ea4cd3ca","head":{"label":"peter-toth:SPARK-34756-fix-filescan-equality-check","ref":"SPARK-34756-fix-filescan-equality-check","sha":"0d38ac27dec27b77e0057113fbb57de8ea4cd3ca","user":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":130546049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzA1NDYwNDk=","name":"spark","full_name":"peter-toth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"peter-toth","id":7253827,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNTM4Mjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7253827?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth","html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peter-toth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/peter-toth/spark","description":"Mirror

BigDecimal.\r\n\r\nThis PR support the patterns for numeric formatting as follows:\r\n\r\nPattern | Description\r\n-- | --\r\n9 | Value with the specified number of digits\r\n0 | Value with leading zeros\r\n. (period) | Decimal point\r\n, (comma) | Group (thousand) separator\r\nS | Sign anchored to number (uses locale)\r\n$ | a value with a leading dollar sign\r\nD | Decimal point (uses
