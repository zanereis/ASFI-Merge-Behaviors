change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWe weren't passing in impersonate_user as a payload in the front end so it was not allowing users to add private gsheets to datasets or to query them. \r\n\r\nThis also has a fix for a small 500 error that was occurring when editing a private gsheet. It was occurring because encrypted_extra is sometimes a string and sometimes a dict. I'm just running a simple check to make sure. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nCreate a new private gsheet and add a service key. \r\nGo to sql lab\r\nQuery it\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\nThe SUPERSET_DEFAULT theme should not be considered as an independent color scheme as it is just a reference to an existing color scheme that is already part of the list of schemes. This PR excludes the SUPERSET_DEFAULT from the options of color schemes while keeping retro-compatibility with those that use SUPERSET_DEFAULT as a scheme. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n\r\nSee issue #16962\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/136429051-935feaa3-efce-477e-a742-bb1f915a5786.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16822 I added a couple unit tests for BigQuery that would only run if the optional dependencies were installed, as well as some \"generic\" tests based on SQLite for when the dependencies were not found.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I added the BigQuery dependencies to our test dependencies, so that the tests run on CI. I also removed the generic SQLite tests, since they're no longer needed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen template params are malformed in sql lab, we return an error from the backend that doesn't include an error level. This caused the frontend to crash\r\n\r\nI think this was likely caused by https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16917 or https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/16852, but i don't have enough context on the backend right now to resolve it there. I figure we should also harden the frontend to handle this case, so i added the check there. @ofekisr, could you follow up your PR and ensure that all errors you pass from the backend contain an ErrorLevel? We have helper functions to construct those errors, so it shouldn't be too difficult\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

This change makes sure that a `null` value that is not available in the options is considered as`undefined` instead.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 17 35 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/136406429-fc33a0d2-afd0-48bf-838d-0168d1c83ce9.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-10-07 at 17 33 45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/136406179-3ee489de-0cdd-4c01-9ece-38ccdd60df43.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nFixes #16972 \r\nActive tabs were calculated in mount/update lifecycle events in Tabs components by taking current active tabs state and appending active tab key to it. That approach resulted in race condition when there are multiple Tabs components added to a dashboard - they were all operating on the same array and when 1 component finished its job, the rest were still operating on the now outdated array of active tabs. The result was overwriting the results calculated by other Tabs components.\r\nIn order to avoid that, I moved that logic into the Redux reducer, which is guaranteed to be synchronous. Now the Tabs only send current active key and previous active key as strings to Redux and the reducer handles calculating active tabs synchronously.\r\nThe described issue was the direct reason of the linked bug - the filters were out of scope, because `activeTabs` was not calculated correctly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore: see linked issue\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/136361545-77fa09ff-dffe-4832-b405-53af47d98727.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a dashboard with multiple separate Tabs components, including nested Tabs\r\n2. Verify that `dashboardState.activeTabs` in Redux has correct value\r\n3. Add some native filters with scopes set to different Tabs\r\n4. Verify that in scope/out of scope feature works as expected\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing

SUMMARY\r\nThe SqlEditor had two small issues with some CSS that this PR corrects:\r\n1) It was directly using the `supersetTheme` instead of pulling it in via the `ThemeProvider` as is preferred.\r\n2) It randomly had a LESS var in there, which couldn't possibly be working... now it too uses the theme.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo difference.\r\n\r\n###

when their sqllab queries failed due to access errors:\r\n`'SqlJsonExecutionContext' object has no attribute 'query'`\r\n\r\nThe issue is that `_validate_access` is run before `set_query`, so the `execution_context` does not have a `query` attribute during `_validate_access`, which may throw an exception that uses query details to generate an error message. This was likely a regression caused by #16852.\r\n\r\nI am not very satisfied with this fix - `SqlJsonExecutionContext` should probably always have a `query` attribute since it's a dataclass? But I'm not sure what the intended behavior is, so input is welcome.\r\n\r\n@ofekisr

SUMMARY\r\nThe native filters were firing unnecessary queries when their values changed. This was happening because an `useEffect` hook uses the `formData` as a dependency and the `url_params` property changes every time a value changes. To avoid that, I removed the `url_params` from the comparison but we should definitely improve our `useEffect` dependencies to use more granular information instead of big objects that require deep comparison. Added a `TODO` in the code for future refactoring.\r\n\r\nI also changed the dependency in the calculation of the cascade filters tree to avoid unnecessary runs.\r\n\r\n@rusackas @villebro

SUMMARY\r\nAs part of Superset roadmap and [SIP-64](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/14383), by the end of this year 2021, Superset will not support filter_box anymore. This PR is to create a transition mode for dashboards with **only** filter_box (and without filter component):  when feature flag `ENABLE_FILTER_BOX_MIGRATION` is enabled,  dashboard will automatically convert filter_box to dashboard native filter component in front-end only, so that user can review the converted dashboard, then save or abandon change in case any issues found. \r\n\r\nThis PR is mostly designed for airbnb users who used dashboard for many years, and had large dashboards with many charts, tabs, and scoped filters. Manually convert filter_box to filter component for us will be a nightmare. This PR is to make sure our heavy dashboards can go through a smooth transition to the next state. For dashboards that have mixed filter_box and filter components, we assume the size of dashboard is pretty small and the number of filter_box must be manageable, the dashboard owner should convert their filter_box manually.\r\n\r\nAt the end of transition time, we will run db migration which hard converts all filter_box into filter component in dashboard. \r\n\r\n**Note**:  The major goal for this PR is to define **_different dashboard and filter_box behavior_** during transition time. I may need to add a few small UI change PR to improve, but don't want to make this PR too big to review.\r\n\r\nDuring transition time, this is dashboard and filter_box status under different state:\r\n\r\n**Existing dashboard:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"707\" alt=\"v3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/138740303-fc95a9e9-c421-4f46-9999-0a08cffc79ae.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Creating new dashboard:**\r\n\r\n<img width=\"649\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-06 at 8 39 25 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/136236891-1e8dc3f5-7943-493a-9e6c-29ff5af1e3c2.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Before**\r\n![Bu9nvdXeAn](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/136239124-5085c5e2-d439-4756-85bc-01c8669f302a.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\n- For users having filter_box and enabled `ENABLE_FILTER_BOX_MIGRATION` feature flag:\r\n\r\n\r\n![ozricAq2gC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/138736802-5ae34d94-6d7f-4d3b-99a6-a96690946f9b.gif)\r\n\r\n- For users having filter_box but without `ENABLE_FILTER_BOX_MIGRATION` feature flag:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1276\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-08 at 11 43 38 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27990562/136633336-0025039a-11bb-4368-864d-609ffbca94cc.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

issue that only reproed with production build assets. I suspect this would've been caught with cypress, but we build assets in development mode for cypress, so it wasn't caught. This PR should run cypress on prod assets instead of dev ones.\r\n\r\nThis pr also further resolves the webpack bugs by setting usedExports to globa.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI\r\n\r\n###

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere were reports that when you had a report for a chart that the image would be blurry if it was on a mobile gmail app because it was too small. The dashboard feature however, was working fine. \r\n\r\nThis adjusts the chart report to work similarly to the dashboard report screenshot. Working on getting alerts and reports enabled so that I can fully test this. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n![Screenshot_20211015-120824](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/137519992-6a599307-929e-410b-bf0f-93e646645219.png)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_20211015-120509](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/137519830-1e775ed9-6609-4ae4-966a-1462a223245b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe recent upgrade to Webpack 5 in #16701 broke npm linking. While #16867 added watching for changed files, it still didn't update the browser with the new assets. This switches from using `watchOptions.followSymlinks` to the more conventional `config.symlinks` setting, and adds an alias for `react` to point to the one pulled in by the Superset application. This is necessary, as otherwise there will be two instances of React - one fro Superset, and one from `superset-ui`.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. npm link a `superset-ui` package/plugin\r\n2. make code changes to the package/plugin\r\n3. watch the command line trigger the rebuild and the code changes reflected in the browser\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant

SUMMARY\r\nThe PR #16183 that updated some examples dashboard metadata contained a bug where a row component name was changed from `ROW-zhOlQLQnB` to `ROW-dieUdkeUw`, but its id was made equal to another row component (`ROW-xSeNAspgw` instead of its own name defined on line 240). This clashing id caused deleting rows/components on the dashboard to break.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOT\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/135818666-226ca7b9-4277-4754-ac8a-a02cfcd9b539.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Run `superset load-examples`\r\n2. Open the COVID dashobard\r\n3. Go into edit mode\r\n4. Delete all rows and and see the error above (after the fix all rows are properly deleted)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR introduces several enhancements to the native filters form and some new functionalities:\r\n\r\n- It shows [untitled] on the left pane when no name is entered. This is consistent with other parts of the platform\r\n- It shows an error indication on the left pane when an error is generated on the fly or on save. This drags the attention of the user to the right filters where an action is required\r\n- It restructures a little bit the form using the Antdesign `Form.Item` wherever possible. However, the constraints of this implementation are huge and I advocate for a full refactor _asap_\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60598000/136043592-7eaa2ca3-475a-40e0-87a7-35a40691d1c2.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a Dashboard with native filters enabled\r\n2. Fill in the form and observe the behavior when an error is generated\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a component is dropped directly under a tab in the dashboard editor and the cross filter feature flag is enabled, the following error sometimes appears:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/135617512-b7a2de56-8a50-469d-a9c0-39e2093d3fcf.png)\r\n\r\nThis is caused by the dashboard creating a wrapper component that marks itself as its parent, causing an infinite loop when traversing all children in the cross filter indicator. The reason for this was a logical error in the code, where the wrapper id was supposed to be added to the wrapped component, but ended up being added to the wrapper itself. Tests are added to check for this going forward.\r\n\r\n### DETAILS\r\n\r\nWhen dropping a a component on the dashboard that requires wrapping (in this case dropping a markdown component directly on a tab, but could also be a chart, or column object: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/87baac7650bdb6a8f8f82cf4992567a2c5c73cba/superset-frontend/src/dashboard/util/shouldWrapChildInRow.js#L27-L39), the component is wrapped in a wrapper component (in this case a ROW component). However, the wrapper adds itself as it's own parent, while it should add itself to the wrapped component:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/135616201-42a7bb12-087b-4043-9e83-782e8ae7bf60.png)\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, after saving the dashboard, the layout metadata is fixed:\r\n- the wrapped component correctly references the wrapper as its closest parent\r\n- the wrapper no longer references itself\r\n\r\nSee the screenshot below for the post-save state:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/135616416-0b099491-14d1-4e33-8fa7-1efd2249b441.png)\r\n\r\nWith the changes in this PR, the parents are correct after creation, i.e. won't change after saving.\r\n\r\nThis bug exposed several problems in the associated code, causing unnecessary performance problems. However, these should be fixed in follow-up PRs.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nLocal testing\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\nWhen a table exceeded 50 columns, some of the results would appear to be cut off. The results now show properly by setting the width of the div wrapping the result to `inherit`.\r\n\r\n- Note: This also seems to work the same with `max-content` but `inherit` seemed safer.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### BEFORE\r\n<img width=\"243\" alt=\"before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/135544860-e06cb481-b15f-4617-a0bf-fa4735431f2d.png\">\r\n\r\n#### AFTER\r\n<img width=\"243\" alt=\"after\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55605634/135544866-598f8d7a-b025-4122-9240-f164b37106c7.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nFind/create a table that exceeds 50 columns and contains timestamps. Observe that the results are no longer cut off and display correctly.\r\n- If you use the longer superset examples (`superset load-examples -b`), you can repro this in SQL Lab's SQL editor with this

SUMMARY\r\nDisables the lazy loading for the Database selector. Currently, the SQL Editor depends on some information that is only present when querying the databases like `allows_virtual_table_explore`. Since this information is not present anywhere, we need to force the query of the database selector when first loading the page.\r\n\r\n@jinghua-qa\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

the back button on the DB Connections where after finishing it would not pass validate_parameters.  The issue arose because the received json result had neither an id or parameters in it. This is only an issue in this particular sequence, since all other instances use a fetch that uses the sql_alchemy_uri to show parameters, and also includes the id in the json.result.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/135294219-0ee5b32f-0704-4ec1-90f5-8aa72995ae14.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48933336/135293843-401d2306-da61-4b16-b57b-472dcbad0913.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe recent PR #16660 broke series limiting for databases that don't support subqueries (Pinot and Solr). This moves the check for `allows_subqueries` down one level to the section where the subquery is constructed, thus allowing for a prequery to populate the series values to limit by if subqueries/joins aren't supported.\r\n\r\nNote, however, that before #16660 we weren't checking for support for subqueries when constructing the limiting subquery. But since there are no db engine specs that allow joins but don't support subqueries, adding the check for subquery support shouldn't have any practical implications right now.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe `time comparison` in AA can't guarantee accuracy when applied to multiple series line charts. \r\n\r\nDue to the errors of the original algorithm, only consider using the time column to `join`. Now the join algorithm is improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n![Time comparison-after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/135451029-25564bd1-a1c5-4a37-b096-db623059f3e3.png)\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n![Time comparison-before](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/135258865-de5c4720-9d76-4bcf-9e5d-4cad9004b781.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/135259011-986c26a8-8189-40a7-a51a-fdbb51a86527.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. select `birth_names` dataset\r\n2. switch to time-series chart\r\n3. set time grain to `year`\r\n4. set time range to `1970 - 2000`\r\n5. set metrics to `sum__num`\r\n6. set group by to `state`\r\n7. set series limit to `2` for convenience\r\n8. set time shift to `3 years later`\r\n9. set calculation type to `actual values`\r\n10. use the `south panel` to observe the accuracy of the data\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

SUMMARY\r\nWith Python 3.10 right around the corner (2021-10-04) and multiple performance improvements when going from 3.7 to 3.8 (see Python Speed Center benchmark summary below), we should move to 3.8 and start preparing for transitioning to 3.9. This PR bumps the official image from Python 3.7 to 3.8 and adds support for Python 3.9. CI is also bumped from 3.7 to 3.8 (btw, `tox` was already confgured with `basepython = python3.8`), and dual tests for 3.7 and 3.8 are replaced with 3.8 and 3.9.\r\n\r\n### Performance benchmark\r\nOn most benchmark tests, 3.8 (blue) performs slightly better than 3.7

that are not in BasicParametersSchema into their own file in order to make DB Connections Form smaller. The reason for doing this because we are going to be parsing Snowflake's sql alchemy uri in order to enable it for the dynamic form. \r\n\r\nThis PR also builds up build_sql_alchemy_uri, and get_parameters_from_uri in the Snowflake engine spec. \r\n\r\nLastly, as part of a larger refactor of the DB connection form, I created a validatedInputField that is a sort of go to for any basic string fields that we may want to add to the DB Connection Form. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR is making Dashboard Native_Filter on by default. User will be able to access to this feature without configuring going forward. This feature has been throughout tested and is ready for prime time. In fact, without this feature being visible, user may hit bugs when trying to use the legacy Filterbox along or with Native filter at the same time. This change will also drive users away from using Filterbox which has been causing errors.   \r\n\r\nNOTE: We will remove this FF for good in about 1 month. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR

SUMMARY\r\nThe recent upgrade of Webpack to version 5 (#16701) broke hot reloading of linked packages. This fixes hot reloading by enabling the `config.watchOptions.followSymlinks` flag (https://webpack.js.org/configuration/watch/#watchoptionsfollowsymlinks) . Enabling `config.resolve.symlinks` doesn't work, as it breaks a bunch of dependencies.  We also ignore a few type errors that are raised when linking `superset-ui/core`. It is unclear why this error is raised when npm linking, but appears to be happening due to fairly complex polymorphism in the registry classes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. `npm ci`\r\n2. Link `core` and `chart-controls` and a chart plugin, e.g. `npm link ../../superset-ui/packages/superset-ui-core ../../superset-ui/packages/superset-ui-chart-controls ../../superset-ui/plugins/plugin-chart-echarts`\r\n3. `npm run dev-server`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

<code>useDrag::spec.begin</code> method.</p>\n<h2>14.0.1</h2>\n<h2>Patch</h2>\n<p>Update internal hook <code>useDragType()</code> to align with updated typings. Check 14.0.0 release for API changes</p>\n<h2>14.0.0</h2>\n<p>This release addresses a handful of nagging liveness and ergonomic issues with the hooks API.</p>\n<p>The liveness issues affect all hooks, and were discovered on deeper inspection of certain stress tests in the documentation. The internal <code>useCollector()</code> hook is used to collect props from the DnD system when <em>things change</em>. Prior to this update, we subscribed to updates from the DnD monitor to trigger prop collection. However, state on <em>the react side</em> was only accounted for on the first render. This release improves that liveness by collecting props whenever react state changes.</p>\n<p>The ergonomics of the <code>useDrag</code> have been refactored. In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>spec.type</code> is required</li>\n<li><code>spec.item</code> can be a function or static object.</li>\n<li>The function version of <code>spec.item</code> replaces <code>spec.begin</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since the release of the hooks API, we packed <code>type</code> under <code>spec.item</code>. However, this led to nonintuitive situations where an <code>item</code> field was required to be specified even though items are created in the <code>begin</code> method.</p>\n<p>Additionally, in the original React-DnD design, <code>beginDrag()</code> was optional and the <strong>type</strong> of the draggables had to be defined. If no explicit DragObject was created, an implicit object was created by the system..</p>\n<p>The change we've made here decouples <code>type</code> from <code>item</code>, and collapses <code>begin</code> into <code>item</code>.</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>// Pre-v14\nuseDrag({\n   // item defined here to get a type\n   item: { type: BOX } },\n   // ...but the actual item is created here\n   begin: () =&gt; ({ id })\n})\n<p>// v14\nuseDrag({\ntype: BOX,\nitem: () =&gt; ({id})\n})\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n</code></pre></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
