PR adds the GroupMetadataManager to the group-coordinator module. This manager is responsible for handling the groups management, the members management and the entire reconciliation process. At this point, only the new consumer group type/protocol is implemented.\r\n\r\nAs you will see, the new manager is based on an architecture inspired from the quorum controller. A request can access/read the state but can't mutate it directly. Instead, a list of records is generated together with the response and those records will be applied to the state by the runtime framework. We use timeline data structures. Note that the runtime framework is not part of this PR. It will come in a following one.\r\n\r\nFor the reviewers, I suggest starting from the GroupMetadataManager.consumerGroupHeartbeat method. From there, you will how the consumer group heartbeat is handled and how all the classes fit together. Then, it is possible to review the classes independently, I suppose.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

Motivation\r\nWhen Log cleaning is shutdown, it doesn't remove metrics that were registered to `KafkaYammerMetrics.defaultRegistry()` which has one instance per server. Log cleaner's lifecycle is associated with lifecycle of `LogManager` and hence, there is no possibility where log cleaner will be shutdown but the broker won't. Broker shutdown will close the `jmxReporter` and hence, there is no current metric leak here.\r\nThe motivation for this code change is to \"do the right thing\" from a code hygiene perspective.\r\n\r\n# Test\r\nAdded a unit test that fails before the change and passes after the change.","created_at":"2023-04-21T13:01:22Z","updated_at":"2023-05-10T14:59:17Z","closed_at":"2023-05-05T11:55:18Z","merged_at":"2023-05-05T11:55:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"e34f88403159cc8381da23dafdf7e3d7403114a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13623/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13623/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13623/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/a9c97d9878a69a9cc758a5d891c16ea702b7f519","head":{"label":"divijvaidya:KAFKA-14926","ref":"KAFKA-14926","sha":"a9c97d9878a69a9cc758a5d891c16ea702b7f519","user":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":472367950,"node_id":"R_kgDOHCfDTg","name":"kafka","full_name":"divijvaidya/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya/kafka","description":"Mirror

change intends to support an application using Vertx GRPC server to perform the Checkpoint and Restore on JVM implementing this, specifically using [OpenJDK CRaC](https://github.com/openjdk/crac/tree/crac) or future versions of OpenJDK. Package org.crac is a facade that either forwards the invocation to actual implementation or provides a no-op implementation.\r\n\r\nRight now a test of the actual behaviour is not provided; without running on CRaC-enabled JVM there's nothing that would invoke the `Resource` methods, and making this a part of testsuite would be complicated (probably through a containerized test). If needed, I could try to put together a test not involving the actual checkpoint, that would verify that the code does not deadlock and that connections are eventually re-created.\r\n\r\nIt is not entirely clear to me what level of API publicity are the `KafkaClient` and `Selectable` interfaces and in what version could this land, or if I should do the changes only on the implementation classes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-20T06:28:32Z","updated_at":"2025-01-02T03:37:53Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/401089f8ff5bfdf598d8818f35a6766320553bf0","head":{"label":"rvansa:crac","ref":"crac","sha":"401089f8ff5bfdf598d8818f35a6766320553bf0","user":{"login":"rvansa","id":2167869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2167869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa","html_url":"https://github.com/rvansa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":629412381,"node_id":"R_kgDOJYQSHQ","name":"kafka","full_name":"rvansa/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rvansa","id":2167869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjc4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2167869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa","html_url":"https://github.com/rvansa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rvansa/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rvansa/kafka","description":"Apache

server side as well to take some load off the client. The group coordinator either directly computes the new target assignment for the group based on its default server-side assignor or requests a new assignment from one of the members in the group.\r\n\r\nThere will be two types of assignors :- Range, Uniform. This PR is for the Server side range assignor.\r\nThis PR is for the  Optimized Uniform Assignor which has two parts to it:\r\n1) When all the subscriptions are equal we do an optimized assignment \r\n2) When the subscriptions are different we do a general assignment\r\n\r\n**The optimized uniform assignor has the liberty to treat each partition with equal weight since any member can get any partition from the subscribed topics. This makes it easier to distribute partitions and calculate quotas as a whole.** \r\n\r\nThe tests aim to cover all the possible cases when a re-assignment can be triggered.\r\n\r\nRead the document

a bug in the table-table join handling of out-of-order records in versioned tables (see https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13510 and https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13522 for context) where if the latest value for a particular key is a tombstone, then out-of-order records are not properly identified because versioned stores do not return timestamps for tombstones (so there is no timestamp to compare against, when deciding whether a record is out-of-order or not). This results in out-of-order records improperly being identified as not out-of-order, when the latest value for the key is a tombstone.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by using the `isLatest` value from the `Change` object (see https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13564) instead of calling `get(key)` on the state store to fetch timestamps to compare against. As part of this fix, this PR also updates table-table joins to determine whether upstream tables are versioned by using the GraphNode mechanism, instead of checking the table's value getter. This also enables us to remove the additional state store access granted to join processors in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13510 and https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13522, resulting in a cleaner topology.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

extra state in the producer state entry to track verification and tentative sequence.\r\n\r\nWhen verifying, there is a race condition that the add partitions verification response returns that the partition is in the ongoing transaction, but an abort marker is written before we get to append. Therefore, we track that the state is verified with a given producer epoch. We also update this state to VERIFIED in memory as soon as the response is sent and confirms the partition is in the transaction. Right before our append (in lock) we confirm verification and epoch again.\r\n\r\nWhile working on this change, we also noticed that when the add partitions response returns a retriable error, sometimes the next batch succeeds before the old one can retry. This exposed the known out of order sequence issue when we have no state yet in the PSM. (We accept a later sequence and the earlier one will get stuck in a retry loop.) In order to prevent this issue from getting worse when verifying, we also set state about the tentative first sequence. When we start to verify for a partition, and we have no batch information for a given epoch, we also store the lowest sequence we see. That way, in the case above, we will return a retriable error and prevent writing a later sequence before the earlier one can be retried. Once any batch exists in the state, we no longer track this sequence, since we have reliable sequence information in the batch.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

Part-2) (#13526)\r\n\r\nThis patch implemented the second part of KIP-915. It bumps the versions of the value records used by the group coordinator and the transaction coordinator to make them flexible versions. The new versions are not used when writing to the partitions but only when reading from the partitions. This allows downgrades from future versions that will include tagged fields.\r\n\r\nReviewers: David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

Part-2) (#13526)\r\n\r\nThis patch implemented the second part of KIP-915. It bumps the versions of the value records used by the group coordinator and the transaction coordinator to make them flexible versions. The new versions are not used when writing to the partitions but only when reading from the partitions. This allows downgrades from future versions that will include tagged fields.\r\n\r\nReviewers: David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

Part-2) (#13526)\r\n\r\nThis patch implemented the second part of KIP-915. It bumps the versions of the value records used by the group coordinator and the transaction coordinator to make them flexible versions. The new versions are not used when writing to the partitions but only when reading from the partitions. This allows downgrades from future versions that will include tagged fields.\r\n\r\nReviewers: David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

, I am getting a gradle build failure (using Intellij gradle plugin) during compileScala and compileTestScala because of what seems to be a non-ASCII character in RemoteLogManager.java and RemoteLogManagerTest.java. The errors that I get are :\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Error] /Users/sagarrao/gitprojects/kafka/core/src/test/java/kafka/log/remote/RemoteLogManager.java:457:  error: unmappable character for encoding ASCII\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\n[Error] /Users/sagarrao/gitprojects/kafka/core/src/test/java/kafka/log/remote/RemoteLogManagerTest.java:205:  error: unmappable character for encoding ASCII\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the build seems to be working.

added verification to transactional produce requests to confirm an ongoing transaction.\r\n\r\nThere is an edge case where the transaction is added, but the coordinator is writing to the log for another partition. In this case, when verifying, we return CONCURRENT_TRANSACTIONS and retry. However, the next inflight batch is often successful because the write completes. \r\n\r\nWhen a partition has no entry in the PSM, it will allow any sequence number. This means if we retry the first write to the partition (or first write in a while) we will never be able to write it and get OutOfOrderSequence exceptions. This is a known issue. Since the verification makes this more common, I propose allowing verification on pending ongoing state since the pending state doesn't prevent us from checking the already added partitions.\r\n\r\nThe good news is part 2 of KIP-890 will allow us to enforce that the first write for a transaction is sequence 0 and this issue will go away entirely.  \r\n\r\nThis PR also adds the locking back into the addPartitions/verify path that was incorrectly removed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

fixes test failures introduced in KIP-894 #13373\r\n\r\nIn CI these tests are exceeding the 1-second flat timeout defined in the FakeForwardingAdmin, while they very frequently pass locally.\r\n\r\nThe reason that these tests regressed with the particular PR is that it changed MM2 from using the deprecated alterConfigs method to the incrementalAlterConfigs method, which is not intercepted by the FakeForwardingAdmin. The config sync is a repeated operation, and these repeats made it more likely that at least one of the operations would complete in under 1-second, causing the test to pass. Without the regular configSync call, the tests would fail when the topic creation exceeded the timeout, which was very likely.\r\n\r\nWithout the 1-second timeout, and without intercepting incrementalAlterConfigs method, the successful topic creation should be sufficient to pass all of these tests. This does mean that the test names are not accurate, and this will be addressed in a follow-up.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

`SocketServer` to set the `setReuseAddress(true)` socket option.\r\n\r\nThis aids use-cases where kafka is started/stopped on the same port in rapid succession. Examples are: where a kafka cluster is embedded in an integration test suite that starts/stops a cluster before/after each test.\r\n\r\nI don't think this change brings any backward compatibility concerns, so I don't think it will need to be configurable.  However I can make it that way if necessary.\r\n\r\nI have tested this change locally and confirmed that with the option the sporadic issue I see goes away.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

there are two metrics for measuring the traffic in topic dimensions: MessagesInPerSec, BytesInPerSec, but there are two problems:\r\n1. It is difficult to intuitively reflect the problem of topic partition traffic inclination through these indicators, and it is impossible to clearly see which partition has the largest traffic and the traffic situation of each partition. But the partition dimension can solve this.\r\n2. For the sudden increase in topic traffic (for example, this will lead some followers to out of Isr, which can be avoided by appropriately increasing the number of partitions.), the metrics of the partition dimension can help to provide guidance on whether to expand the partition.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I think it is very meaningful to add traffic metrics of partition dimension, especially the issue of traffic skew.\r\n\r\nThe added two partition dimension metrics have passed the unit test in MetricsTest.","created_at":"2023-04-14T10:29:23Z","updated_at":"2023-09-01T02:50:58Z","closed_at":"2023-09-01T02:50:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"246cb5e66dad06d55a751e6741bb4f1a966a8de9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/12a10c5559e9e5a5884edc93649e1727c8f98e23","head":{"label":"hudeqi:hdq_add_partition_metrics","ref":"hdq_add_partition_metrics","sha":"12a10c5559e9e5a5884edc93649e1727c8f98e23","user":{"login":"hudeqi","id":16536770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16536770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi","html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271168921,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzExNjg5MjE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"hudeqi/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hudeqi","id":16536770,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM2Nzcw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16536770?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi","html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hudeqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hudeqi/kafka","description":"Mirror

introduced a new boolean `isLatest` into `Change` to indicate whether a change update represents the latest for the key. Even though `Change` is serialized into the table repartition topic, the new boolean does not need to be serialized in, because the table repartition map processor performs an optimization to drop records for which `isLatest = false`. If not for this optimization, the downstream table aggregate would have to drop such records instead, and `isLatest` would need to be serialized into the repartition topic. \r\n\r\nIn light of the possibility that `isLatest` may need to be serialized into the repartition topic in the future, e.g., if other downstream processors are added which need to distinguish between records for which `isLatest = true` vs `isLatest = false`, this PR reserves repartition topic formats which include `isLatest`. Reserving these formats now comes at no additional cost to users since a rolling bounce is already required for the upcoming release due to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10747. If we don't reserve them now and instead have to add them later, then another bounce would be required at that time. Reserving formats is cheap, so we choose to do it now.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

PR adds an additional boolean `isLatest` into `Change` which specifies whether the new value is the latest for its key. For un-versioned stores, `isLatest` is always true. For versioned stores, `isLatest` is true if the value has the latest timestamp seen for the key, else false. This boolean will be used by processors such as the table repartition map processor to determine when a record is out-of-order and should be dropped (when processing a versioned table). See [KIP-914](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-914%3A+DSL+Processor+Semantics+for+Versioned+Stores) for details. \r\n\r\nThis PR updates the table repartition map processor accordingly, and also adds test coverage for table filter. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

change introduces a remote log segment segment retention cleanup mechanism.\r\n\r\nRemoteLogManager runs retention cleanup activity tasks on each leader replica. It assesses factors such as overall size and retention duration, subsequently removing qualified segments from remote storage. This process also involves adjusting the log-start-offset within the UnifiedLog accordingly. It also cleans up the segments which have epochs earlier to the earliest leader epoch in the current leader. \r\n\r\nPS: This functionality is pulled out from internal branches with other functionalities related to the feature in 2.8.x. The reason for not pulling all the changes as it makes the PR huge and burdensome to review and it also needs other metrics and minor enhancements(including perf) and minor changes done for tests. So, we will try to have followup PRs to cover all those.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Kamal Chandraprakash <kamal.chandraprakash@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

PR implements the test case and a fix for [KAFKA-14845](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14845). \r\n\r\nIt is possible for a broker to create an ephemeral znode `/brokers/ids/XX` but not receive a response to the znode creation request (even the response of session creation can be missed). When the broker reconnects and retries to create the znode, if the ephemeral znode of the \"unacknowledged\" session is not yet deleted (which can happen because there is no strict ordering of events between the deletion of the ephemeral znode of an expired session and the processing of requests from a new session), the znode creation will fail. This case is not handled by [KAFKA-6584](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6584) because here, the ID of the session of the conflicting znode was not previously recorded upon successful creation of the znode.\r\n\r\nSince the conflicting znode is about to be deleted (since its owning session is expired), we let Kafka retry a few times until Zookeeper converges to the right state.\r\n\r\nThe test in the PR simulates the loss of responses to Zookeeper requests (for instance due to network partition) while a broker is in the process of creating its ephemeral znode under /brokers/ids/. This would result in broker registration failing with due to a `NODEEXISTS` error before the fix.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding timeline of events exercised by this test and without the fix is reproduced below.\r\n\r\n![phoque (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/638312/231722168-5bad3910-70e0-4a05-a4d1-d4764e51f3ff.png)\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

PR updates the return type of `VersionedKeyValueStore#put(...)` from void to long, where the long is the validTo timestamp of the newly put record, with two special values to indicate either that no such timestamp exists (because the record is the latest for its key) or that the put did not take place (because grace period has elapsed). See [KIP-914](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-914%3A+DSL+Processor+Semantics+for+Versioned+Stores) for more.\r\n\r\nAs part of making this change, VersionedBytesStore introduces its own `put(key, value, timestamp)` method to avoid method signature conflicts with the existing `put(key, value)` method from `KeyValueStore<Bytes, byte[]>` which has void return type. As a result, the previously added `NullableValueAndTimestampSerde` class is no longer needed so it's also been removed in this PR as cleanup.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

is a really long story, but the incident started in KAFKA-13419 when we observed a member sending out a topic partition owned from the previous generation when a member missed a rebalance cycle due to REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS.\r\n\r\nAfter a long debate, we've decided the best thing to do at the moment is to continue to honor the partition owned by members with the highest generation.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I changed the AbstractStickyAssignor.AllSubscriptionsEqual method.  In short, it should no long check and validate only the highest generation.  Instead, we consider 3 cases:\r\n1. Member will continue to hold on to its partition if there are no other owners\r\n2. If there are 1+ owners to the same partition. One with the highest generation will win.\r\n3. If two members of the same generation hold on to the same partition.  We will log an error but remove both from the assignment. (Same with the current logic)\r\n\r\nHere are some important notes that lead to the PR:\r\n- If a member is kicked out of the group, and `UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID` will be thrown.\r\n- It seems to be a common situation that members are late to joinGroup and therefore get `REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS` error.  This is why we don't want to reset generation because it might cause lots of revocations and can be disruptive\r\n\r\nTo summarize the current behavior of different errors:\r\n`REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS`\r\n- heartbeat: requestRejoin if member state is stable\r\n- joinGroup: rejoin immediately\r\n- syncGroup: rejoin immediately\r\n- commit: requestRejoin and fail the commit. Raise this exception if the generation is staled, i.e. another rebalance is already in progress.\r\n\r\n`UNKNOWN_MEMBER_ID`\r\n- heartbeat: resetStateAndRejoinif generation hasn't changed. otherwise, ignore\r\n- joinGroup: resetStateAndRejoin if generation unchanged, otherwise rejoin immediately\r\n- syncGroup:  resetStateAndRejoin if generation unchanged, otherwise rejoin immediately\r\n\r\n`ILLEGAL_GENERATION`\r\n- heartbeat: resetStateAndRejoinif generation hasn't changed. otherwise, ignore\r\n- syncGroup: raised the exception if generation has been resetted or the member hasn't completed rebalancing.  then resetStateAndRejoin if generation unchanged, otherwise rejoin immediately","created_at":"2023-04-12T20:42:46Z","updated_at":"2023-05-02T11:48:06Z","closed_at":"2023-04-28T09:08:32Z","merged_at":"2023-04-28T09:08:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6ad151ac3bac0d8d1d6985d230eacaa170b8984","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13550/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13550/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13550/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/cf3d778a138032ad6156a9aef0db1d8464bf9cab","head":{"label":"philipnee:kafka-13891-stickier-assignor","ref":"kafka-13891-stickier-assignor","sha":"cf3d778a138032ad6156a9aef0db1d8464bf9cab","user":{"login":"philipnee","id":1930388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzAzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1930388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee","html_url":"https://github.com/philipnee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":447334730,"node_id":"R_kgDOGqnJSg","name":"kafka","full_name":"philipnee/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"philipnee","id":1930388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzAzODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1930388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee","html_url":"https://github.com/philipnee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/philipnee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/philipnee/kafka","description":"Mirror

MetadataLoader is not supposed to publish metadata updates until we have loaded up to the high water mark. Previously, this logic was broken, and we published updates immediately. This PR fixes that and adds a junit test.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that the MetadataLoader previously assumed that we would periodically get callbacks from the Raft layer even if nothing had happened. We relied on this to install new publishers in a timely fashion, for example. However, in older MetadataVersions that don't include NoOpRecord, this is not a safe assumption.\r\n\r\nAside from the above changes, also fix a deadlock in SnapshotGeneratorTest, fix the log prefix for BrokerLifecycleManager, and remove metadata publishers on brokerserver shutdown (like we do for controllers).\r\n\r\nReviewers: David Arthur <mumrah@gmail.com>, dengziming <dengziming1993@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nConflicts: This patch was cut down to make it easier to cherry-pick to this older branch. Specifically, I removed the BrokerLifecycleManager.scala logging change and the BrokerServer installPublishers and removeAndClosePublisher changes.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.
