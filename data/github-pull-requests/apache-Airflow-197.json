Final Commit Msg:\r\n\r\n- Fix functionality\r\n  last_scheduler_run was missed in the process of\r\n  migrating from sync_to_db/bulk_sync_to_db to bulk_write_to_db.\r\n\r\n  This issue will fail DAG.deactivate_stale_dags() method,\r\n  and blocks users from checking the last schedule time of each DAG in DB\r\n\r\n- Change name last_scheduler_run to last_parsed_time,\r\n  to better reflect what it does now.\r\n  Migration script is added, and codebase is updated\r\n\r\n- To ensure the migration scripts can work,\r\n  we have to limit the columns needed in create_dag_specific_permissions(),\r\n  so migration 2c6edca13270 can work with the renamed column.\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdate: \r\n\r\nAs discussed below, the name of `last_scheduler_run` needs to be re-considered, but so far the decision is `last_parsed_time`.\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n`last_scheduler_run` was missed to be considered in the process of migrating from

starts to exist from **2.0.0**, and also exist in **2.0.1**.

Issue and Background\r\n\r\nLet's take the example DAG `tutorial_taskflow_api_etl` as example. In **2.0.1**, the DAG doc in Markdown format is not rendered properly.\r\n\r\n![tutorial_taskflow_api_etl_-_Tree_-_Airflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/109669625-91f25c80-7b72-11eb-87e4-6e745de27837.png)\r\n\r\nIf it's rendered properly, it should look like the DAG Docs of another example DAG, `tutorial`,\r\n\r\n![tutorial_-_Tree_-_Airflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/109669825-cc5bf980-7b72-11eb-8ae2-a8ef9f9a24ed.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why\r\n\r\nBecause of how TaskFlow DAGs are constructed, their `__doc__` lines may start with spaces. This fails `markdown.markdown()`, and the doc in Markdown format cannot be transformed into HTML properly, and further fails the doc display in the UI.\r\n\r\nActually this also affects the non-TaskFlow DAGs (if users accidentally add a space in the beginning of any line in the `__doc__`)\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef x(x):\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    ### Header\r\n    XD's test\r\n    2nd line\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    return x * 2\r\n\r\nimport markdown\r\n\r\nprint('Case-1')\r\nprint(markdown.markdown(x.__doc__))\r\n\r\nprint('Case-2')\r\nprint(markdown.markdown('\\n'.join(line.lstrip() for line in x.__doc__.split('\\n'))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nCase-1\r\n<pre><code>### Header\r\nXD's test\r\n2nd line\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nCase-2\r\n<h3>Header</h3>\r\n<p>XD's test\r\n2nd line</p>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes this by always doing left strip for each line of the doc md.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

may not be a ready PR. The code diff best expresses my ideas.\r\n\r\nI'm initializing a mysql 5.7 db from empty using `hub.docker.com, apache/airflow:2.0.1-python3.8`. The migration scripts throw errors of `(1071, 'Specified key was too long; max key length is 767 bytes')`. `AIRFLOW__CORE__SQL_ENGINE_COLLATION_FOR_IDS: utf8mb3_general_ci` does not work. (ref #7570).\r\n\r\nAfter go through the issues and code, I had an assumption that `utf8mb3` config was not applied to all places that it should. I applied those migration scripts manually, then it works.\r\n\r\nI'm not confident about how the migration scripts work.\r\n\r\n1. Should it be generated by some tools and not modified manually?\r\n2. Some scripts modify existed columns. Can I directly fix the `create table` scripts and skip the `modify table` ones? How does this affect the old users wants to upgrade?\r\n\r\n~~Another question.~~\r\n\r\n~~I cannot fix the line `bop.create_primary_key('pk_xcom', ['dag_id', 'task_id', 'key', 'execution_date'])`.

is by far the biggest improvements of the test execution time\r\nwe can get now when we are using self-hosted runners.\r\n\r\nThis change drives down the time of executing all tests on\r\nself-hosted runners from ~ 50 minutes to ~ 13 minutes due to heavy\r\nparallelisation we can implement for different test types and the\r\nfact that our machines for self-hosted runners are far more\r\ncapable - they have more CPU, more memory and the fact that\r\nwe are using tmpfs for everything.\r\n\r\nThis change will also drive the cost of our self-hosted runners\r\ndown. Since we have auto-scaling infrastructure we will simply need\r\nthe machines to run tests for far shorter time. Since the number\r\nof test jobs we run on those self hosted runners is substantial\r\n(10 jobs), we are going to save ~ 6 build hours per one PR/merged\r\ncommit!\r\n\r\nThis also allows the developers to use the power of their\r\ndevelopment machines - when you use\r\n`./scripts/ci/testing/ci_run_airflow_testing.sh` the script\r\ndetects how many CPU cores are available and it will run as\r\nmany parallel test types as many cores you have.\r\n\r\nAlso in case of Integration tests - they require more memory to run\r\nall the integrations, so in case there is less than ~ 32 GB of RAM\r\navailable to Docker, the integration tests are run sequentially\r\nat the end. This drives stability up for machines with lower memory.\r\n\r\nOn one personal PC (64GB RAM, 8 CPUS/16 cores, fast SSD) the full\r\ntest suite execution went down from 30 minutes to 5 minutes.\r\n\r\nThere is a continuous progress information printed every 10 seconds when\r\neither parallel or sequential tests are run, and the full output is\r\nshown at the end - failed tests are marked in red groups, and succesful are\r\nmarked in green groups. This makes it easier to see and analyse errors.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

current health check implemented the logic of URL parsing and setting URI connection value regardless of the Airflow code, which caused compatibility issues: \r\n* some URLs were not parsed correctly;\r\n* some more complex configurations did not work, e.g. when the backend secret was used to store passwords, the SQLIte database was checked\r\n* The SQLite database was not checked and due to permission issues it still might not be healthy.\r\n\r\nTo overcome these limitations, I wrote a health check that uses a built-in command - airflow db check. Now we have more confidence that the database is in good shape because we are using more code from Airflow and executing a `SELECT 1` query, which allows us to discover more connection problems.\r\n\r\nThe old code is still used for older versions of Airflow.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

clarified a little unclear change resulting from #14480 which\r\ndid not carry an explanation why we want to return exit code 64.\r\n\r\nExplanation is added back and explicit check for False is used.

This is\r\nnot clear in the click documentation, so expicit check for False\r\nvalue better reflects the intention here.\r\n\r\nBreeze commands and documentation is also updated so that both\r\ninvocation via breeze (which assures coommon import check) and\r\nmanual execution for debugging can take advantage of it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

PR includes the new community provider Airbyte.\r\n[Airbyte](www.airbyte.io) It is an open-source data integration platform that syncs data from applications, APIs & databases to data warehouses lakes & DBs.\r\nIn my opinion, it will be handy to have this integration working. (I work as a Data Engineer, and it will help a lot in my projects to be able to control Airbyte jobs through Airflow)\r\n\r\nThe Airbyte API was released at the beginning of the month, so I took the opportunity to start building Operator and Hook. In a discussion on the [Airbyte Github](https://github.com/airbytehq/airbyte/issues/836) was suggested to use the UUID identification (`connectionId`) of the connection itself. This way, the Operator will act as a trigger calling the Airbyte API.\r\n\r\nThere are some additional files like the logo and editing of docs that I am doing. If you can comment on it I appreciate it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**About the execution steps from the Operator and Hook**\r\nI built the **AirbyteTriggerSyncOperator** calls the **AirbyteHook** (like most providers do).\r\nThe AirbyteHook performs a call to the `submit_job` function, and this is a request to the API that will return the `job_id` value.\r\nBecause jobs can take a long time, a flow is performed to wait for some status other than running.\r\nWith the `job_id` variable, the process is monitored with the `wait_for_job` function until it returns some **success** or error **status**, or **timeout**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI used the GoogleDataProc and OpsGenie providers as the basis for building mine.\r\nOpsGenie also uses API calls based on HttpHook.\r\nDataproc helped me build the process of waiting for the job to finish to release the flow from the DAG.\r\n\r\nI already executed the tests locally but using my own setup. At the moment, I'd a problem configuring Airflow following CONTRIBUTORS_QUICK_START. As this is my first contribution, I think there are some points for improvement.

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/14481\r\n\r\nThe dag detail endpoint is a python object and was modelled as a database schema object. This caused the tags output to be empty because the tags attribute of DAG object is just a string while DagModel tags attribute is a list of TagModel object.\r\n\r\nAlso, DAG object doesn't have `owners` attribute but `owner` which is a string containing the owners e.g `owner = 'airflow, Anotherowner'`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by modeling the DagDetail schema as a python

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

This is even more apparent when your `max_tis` gets low with the various `min`s in the scheduler main loop code path ( either because your overall pool open slots are low, your parallelism is low, or you've set `max_tis_per_query` too low ).\r\n\r\nThe unit test reproduces the issue ( though I'm still not convinced it's the best way to show it, I've included further down a \"setup\", I guess this should be thrown into an integration test instead? ):\r\n\r\nThe test setup idea is to fill the set of schedule-able TIs returned by that query full of TIs that will starve a first pool from open slots, and then add another set of schedule-able TIs that should be easy to schedule and execute because their execution pool is much bigger. Without filtering out TIs from the first pool ( that will be further discarded in that code path ) we end up with a scheduler stuck until the first pool gets through its work, this starves the second pool for no reason other than the scheduler never getting to them:\r\n\r\nUsing a minimal \"real-life\" example ( you need to create a `starving_pool` with only a couple of slots, and \"limit\" your `max_tis` either manually or through `parallelism` ... ), your scheduler will quickly converge to a log similar to this, even though TIs from `starved_dag` could easily be scheduled and executed:\r\n```\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:43,604] {scheduler_job.py:950} INFO - 2 tasks up for execution:\r\n        <TaskInstance: starving_pool.sleeper 2021-02-26 03:20:00+00:00 [scheduled]>\r\n        <TaskInstance: starving_pool.sleeper 2021-02-26 03:10:00+00:00 [scheduled]>\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:43,606] {scheduler_job.py:979} INFO - Figuring out tasks to run in Pool(name=starving_pool) with 0 open slots and 2 task instances ready to be queued\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:43,606] {scheduler_job.py:994} INFO - Not scheduling since there are 0 open slots in pool starving_pool\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:43,606] {scheduler_job.py:1072} INFO - Setting the following tasks to queued state:\r\n\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:44,757] {scheduler_job.py:950} INFO - 2 tasks up for execution:\r\n        <TaskInstance: starving_pool.sleeper 2021-02-26 03:20:00+00:00 [scheduled]>\r\n        <TaskInstance: starving_pool.sleeper 2021-02-26 03:10:00+00:00 [scheduled]>\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:44,759] {scheduler_job.py:979} INFO - Figuring out tasks to run in Pool(name=starving_pool) with 0 open slots and 2 task instances ready to be queued\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:44,759] {scheduler_job.py:994} INFO - Not scheduling since there are 0 open slots in pool starving_pool\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:44,759] {scheduler_job.py:1072} INFO - Setting the following tasks to queued state:\r\n\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:45,068] {scheduler_job.py:950} INFO - 2 tasks up for execution:\r\n        <TaskInstance: starving_pool.sleeper 2021-02-26 03:20:00+00:00 [scheduled]>\r\n        <TaskInstance: starving_pool.sleeper 2021-02-26 03:10:00+00:00 [scheduled]>\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:45,070] {scheduler_job.py:979} INFO - Figuring out tasks to run in Pool(name=starving_pool) with 0 open slots and 2 task instances ready to be queued\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:45,070] {scheduler_job.py:994} INFO - Not scheduling since there are 0 open slots in pool starving_pool\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:45,070] {scheduler_job.py:1072} INFO - Setting the following tasks to queued state:\r\n\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:45,309] {scheduler_job.py:950} INFO - 2 tasks up for execution:\r\n        <TaskInstance: starving_pool.sleeper 2021-02-26 03:20:00+00:00 [scheduled]>\r\n        <TaskInstance: starving_pool.sleeper 2021-02-26 03:10:00+00:00 [scheduled]>\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:45,311] {scheduler_job.py:979} INFO - Figuring out tasks to run in Pool(name=starving_pool) with 0 open slots and 2 task instances ready to be queued\r\n[2021-02-26 08:56:45,311] {scheduler_job.py:994} INFO - Not scheduling since there are 0 open slots in pool starving_pool\r\n```\r\n\r\n`starved_dag.py`\r\n```\r\n\"\"\"DAG starved even though its TIs are executable in a non starved pool ( default pool )\"\"\"\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.models.dag import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom airflow.utils.dates import days_ago\r\n\r\nDAG_NAME = 'starved_dag'\r\n\r\ndefault_args = {'owner': 'airflow', 'start_date': days_ago(0), 'dagrun_timeout': timedelta(minutes=6)}\r\ndag = DAG(DAG_NAME, schedule_interval='*/10 * * * *', default_args=default_args)\r\n\r\nechoer = BashOperator(\r\n    task_id='echoer',\r\n    bash_command='echo \"bonjour\"',\r\n    dag=dag,\r\n)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    dag.cli()\r\n```\r\n\r\n`starving_pool.py`\r\n```\r\n\"\"\"DAG to starve schedulable TIs query\"\"\"\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.models.dag import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom airflow.utils.dates import days_ago\r\n\r\nDAG_NAME = 'starving_pool'\r\n\r\ndefault_args = {'owner': 'airflow', 'start_date': days_ago(0), 'dagrun_timeout': timedelta(minutes=6)}\r\ndag = DAG(DAG_NAME, schedule_interval='*/10 * * * *', default_args=default_args)\r\n\r\nsleeper = BashOperator(\r\n    task_id='sleeper',\r\n    bash_command='sleep 300',\r\n    dag=dag,\r\n    pool='starving_pool'\r\n)\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    dag.cli()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe hit this issue in our production stack with real life DAGs. To bypass it, we're currently running with an insanely big unused pool ( `999999` slots :D ), an insanely big `max_tis_per_query`, and an insanely big `parallelism` ( even though we don't have the actual workers behind it ) to make sure that the number of TIs returned by the tweaked query will always be bigger than the maximum number of TIs stuck in starved pools at any point in time.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for

following along the quickstart using Docker's default resource allocation values, the webserver continuously crashes and it is not immediately obvious as to why. Since this might be someone's first exposure to running Airflow, letting them know that they should consider upping their resource allocations could save new people a lot of aggravation. It makes sense - we default to using Celery, but Airflow may be inadvertently blamed as the problem.\r\n\r\nStacktrace:\r\n\r\n```\r\nairflow-webserver_1  | [2021-02-25 17:21:54,330]

clearing the state of Task Instances through the Web UI if the DagRun is in a `FAILED` state, then Airflow will also automatically transition the associated `DagRun` back into the `RUNNING` state.\r\n\r\nHowever, if task instances are being cleared in this manner *after* the DagRun has exceeded its DagRun time out, as calculated by subtracting the `dagrun_timeout` from the current time and comparing that with the DagRun's `start_date`, then this will cause the active scheduler to immediately transition the DagRun back into a `FAILED` state.\r\n\r\nIn most cases this is probably not what the operator wants (why would the operator otherwise clear tasks?). A better approach would be to reset the DagRun's `start_date` and `end_date` when transitioning back to the `RUNNING` state.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/14384\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes two issues:\r\n1. A `TypeError` that would be raised from `_emit_duration_stats_for_finished_state()` when the scheduler transitions a `DagRun` from a `running` state into a `success` or `failed` state if the `DagRun` did not have a `start_date` or `end_date` set.\r\n2. An issue with the `DagRunEditForm`, which would clear the `start_date` and `end_date` for a DagRun, if the form was used to transition a `DagRun` from a `failed` state back into a `running` state (or any other state). In the event where the scheduler would determine the `DagRun` should've been in the `failed` or `success` state (e.g. because the task instances weren't cleared), then this would lead to a scheduler crash.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for
