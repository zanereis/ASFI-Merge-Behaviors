What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFor JDBC data sources, users can specify `batchsize` for multi-row inserts and `fetchsize` for multi-row fetch. A few issues exist:\n- The property keys are case sensitive. Thus, the existing test cases for `fetchsize` use incorrect names, `fetchSize`. Basically, the test cases are broken. \n- No test case exists for `batchsize`. \n- We do not detect the illegal input values for `fetchsize` and `batchsize`. \n\nFor example, when `batchsize` is zero, we got the following exception: \n\n```\nJob aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 0.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0, localhost): java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero\n```\n\nwhen `fetchsize` is less than zero, we got the exception from the underlying JDBC driver:\n\n```\nJob aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 0.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0, localhost): org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Invalid value \"-1\" for parameter \"rows\" [90008-183]\n```\n\nThis PR fixes all the above issues, and issue the appropriate exceptions when detecting the illegal inputs for `fetchsize` and `batchsize`. Also update the function descriptions.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nTest cases are fixed and added.\n","created_at":"2016-06-27T04:46:01Z","updated_at":"2016-07-01T08:55:59Z","closed_at":"2016-07-01T08:55:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d011d4ad2a5ac052d394528f5a8eedd62a6330a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13919/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13919/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13919/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/308d51c09ba6c20af4b0a7333a547b7c3f616404","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:jdbcProperties","ref":"jdbcProperties","sha":"308d51c09ba6c20af4b0a7333a547b7c3f616404","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n[SPARK-8118](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/8196) implements redirecting Parquet JUL logger via SLF4J, but it is currently applied only when READ operations occurs. If users use only WRITE operations, there occurs many Parquet logs.\n\nThis PR makes the redirection work on WRITE operations, too.\n\n**Before**\n\n``` scala\nscala> spark.range(10).write.format(\"parquet\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"/tmp/p\")\nSLF4J: Failed to load class \"org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder\".\nSLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation\nSLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.\nJun 26, 2016 9:04:38 PM INFO: org.apache.parquet.hadoop.codec.CodecConfig: Compression:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR corrects CSV data sources in order to write `DateType` and `TimestampType` correctly just like JSON data source.\n\nCurrently this writes the data as below:\n\n```\n+----------------+\n|            date|\n+----------------+\n|1440637200000000|\n|1414459800000000|\n|1454040000000000|\n+----------------+\n```\n\nThis PR adds the support to write dates and timestamps in a formatted string as below:\n- **TimestampType**\n  - With `dateFormat` option (e.g. `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm`)\n    \n    ```\n    +----------------+\n    |            date|\n    +----------------+\n    |2015/08/26 18:00|\n    |2014/10/27 18:30|\n    |2016/01/28 20:00|\n    +----------------+\n    ```\n  - With `dateFormat` (e.g. `dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm z`) and `timezone` option (e.g. `GMT`)\n    \n    ```\n    +--------------------+\n    |                date|\n    +--------------------+\n    |2015-08-26 18:00 GMT|\n    |2014-10-27 18:30 GMT|\n    |2016-01-28 20:00 GMT|\n    +--------------------+\n    ```\n- **DateType**\n  - With `dateFormat` option (e.g. `yyyy/MM/dd`)\n    \n    ```\n    +----------+\n    |      date|\n    +----------+\n    |2015/08/26|\n    |2014/10/27|\n    |2016/01/28|\n    +----------+\n    ```\n  - With `dateFormat` (e.g. `yyyy/MM/dd z`) and `timezone` option (e.g. `GMT`)\n    \n    ```\n    +--------------+\n    |          date|\n    +--------------+\n    |2015/08/26 GMT|\n    |2014/10/27 GMT|\n    |2016/01/28 GMT|\n    +--------------+\n    ```\n\nThis PR also adds the support for parsing timezone appropriately when reading. So, roundtrip in reading and writing timestamps and dates with the option above would be okay.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in `CsvSuite.scala`.\n","created_at":"2016-06-26T06:18:05Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:12Z","closed_at":"2016-07-19T22:48:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29716e6a01347143c88a5af47618806a7a41b214","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d03e7a0806691b2ad3290cbf7e16a771faf55af1","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-16216","ref":"SPARK-16216","sha":"d03e7a0806691b2ad3290cbf7e16a771faf55af1","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR optimize generate code of projection for an primitive type array. While we know primitive type array does not require null check and has contigious data region, current generated code performs null checks and performs copy for each element (at Lines 075-082 at Generated code before applying this PR)\n1. Eliminate null checks for each array element\n2. Perform bulk data copy by using `Platform.copy`\n3. Eliminate primitive array allocation in `GenericArrayData` when https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13758 is merged\n4. Eliminate setting sparse index for `UnsafeArrayData` when https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13680 is merged\n\nThey are done in a [helper method](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13911/files#diff-85658ffc242280699a331c90530f54baR271) `UnsafeArrayWrite.writePrimitive<PrimitiveType>Array()` (at Line 075 at Generated code after applying this PR).\n\nFor now, 3 and 4 are not currently enabled.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces runtime overhead of a program the creates an primitive array in DataFrame by using the similar approach to #15044. Generated code performs boxing operation in an assignment from InternalRow to an `Object[]` temporary array (at Lines 051 and 061 in the generated code before without this PR). If we know that type of array elements is primitive, we apply the following optimizations:\r\n1. Eliminate a pair of `isNullAt()` and a null assignment\r\n2. Allocate an primitive array instead of `Object[]` (eliminate boxing operations)\r\n3. Create `UnsafeArrayData` by using `UnsafeArrayWriter` to keep a primitive array in a row format instead of doing non-lightweight operations in constructor of `GenericArrayData` \r\nThe PR also performs the same things for `CreateMap`.\r\n\r\nHere are performance results of [DataFrame programs](https://github.com/kiszk/spark/blob/6bf54ec5e227689d69f6db991e9ecbc54e153d0a/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/benchmark/PrimitiveArrayBenchmark.scala#L83-L112) by up to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, the following created tables will be Hive Table.\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE t STORED AS parquet SELECT 1 as a, 1 as b\n```\n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE t1\nROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcSerde'\nSTORED AS\nINPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcInputFormat'\nOUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.OrcOutputFormat'\nSELECT col1, col2 from t3\n```\n\nWhen users create table as query with `STORED AS` or `ROW FORMAT` and `spark.sql.hive.convertCTAS` is set to `true`, we will not convert them to data source tables. Actually, for parquet and orc formats, we still can convert them to data source table even if the users use `STORED AS` or `ROW FORMAT`.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases for both ORC and PARQUET\n","created_at":"2016-06-25T23:11:28Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T04:43:16Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T04:43:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2c07a607de556dac461314774769dd8b9e3b5e84","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13907/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13907/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13907/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a9ce0d8342a2c3768823b4dd120fda0997b1c313","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:storedAsParquet","ref":"storedAsParquet","sha":"a9ce0d8342a2c3768823b4dd120fda0997b1c313","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch makes `InMemoryRelation` faster by generating code to store the input rows as `ColumnarBatches`. This code path is enabled by default but only supports primitive types, falling back to the old, slower code path if there are unsupported types (e.g. strings, arrays, UDTs) in the schema.\n\nThe old code path reads the input rows into `ColumnBuilder`s, which is slow because these builders are backed by `ByteBuffer`s and there are a lot of virtual function calls involved, especially when compression is enabled.\n\nThe following numbers are derived from the read path (i.e. returning rows from cached batches in memory). The baseline is the first row. The second and third rows describe caching performance before this patch. The last row describes caching performance after this patch.\n\n```\nCache random keys:                       Best/Avg Time(ms)   Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)

path\n- scan should return rows as `ColumnarBatch.Row`s instead of `UnsafeRow`s so operators downstream can further benefit from the columnar representation\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAllow to specify empty over clause in window expressions through dataset API\n\nIn SQL, its allowed to specify an empty OVER clause in the window expression.\n\n``` SQL\nselect area, sum(product) over () as c from windowData\nwhere product > 3 group by area, product\nhaving avg(month) > 0 order by avg(month), product\n```\n\nIn this case the analytic function sum is presented based on all the rows of the result set\n\nCurrently its not allowed through dataset API and is handled in this PR.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a new test in DataframeWindowSuite\n","created_at":"2016-06-24T21:03:37Z","updated_at":"2016-06-25T16:26:59Z","closed_at":"2016-06-25T00:28:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f6920f5d4db9bf54e361f5b92116158894eb8db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13897/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13897/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13897/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/33592f6cdb27450642dcff4ca79da262a9272133","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:spark-empty-over","ref":"spark-empty-over","sha":"33592f6cdb27450642dcff4ca79da262a9272133","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nOne of the most frequent usage patterns for Spark SQL is using **cached tables**. This PR improves `InMemoryTableScanExec` to handle `IN` predicate efficiently by pruning partition batches. Of course, the performance improvement varies over the queries and the datasets. But, for the following simple query, the query duration in Spark UI goes from 9 seconds to 50~90ms. It's about over 100 times faster.\n\n**Before**\n\n``` scala\n$ bin/spark-shell --driver-memory 6G\nscala> val df = spark.range(2000000000)\nscala> df.createOrReplaceTempView(\"t\")\nscala> spark.catalog.cacheTable(\"t\")\nscala> sql(\"select id from t where id = 1\").collect()    // About 2 mins\nscala> sql(\"select id from t where id = 1\").collect()    // less than 90ms\nscala> sql(\"select id from t where id in (1,2,3)\").collect()  // 9 seconds\n```\n\n**After**\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"select id from t where id in (1,2,3)\").collect() // less than 90ms\n```\n\nThis PR has impacts over 35 queries of TPC-DS if the tables are cached.\nNote that this optimization is applied for `IN`.  To apply `IN` predicate having more than 10 items, `spark.sql.optimizer.inSetConversionThreshold` option should be increased.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins tests (including new testcases).\n","created_at":"2016-06-24T08:35:03Z","updated_at":"2016-07-20T07:40:24Z","closed_at":"2016-06-25T00:14:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"66f670cb42047424dbb3e8e2f2493da1c4af815b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9d550e3b7885daacdb01e3e54d01f5157af20791","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-16186","ref":"SPARK-16186","sha":"9d550e3b7885daacdb01e3e54d01f5157af20791","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"f4fd7432fb9cf7b197ccada1378c4f2a6d427522","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe root cause is: the output attributes of outer join are derived from its children, while they are actually different attributes(outer join can return null).\n\nWe have already added some special logic to handle it, e.g. `PushPredicateThroughJoin` won't push down predicates through outer join side, `FixNullability`.\n\nThis PR adds one more special logic in `FoldablePropagation`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in `DataFrameSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-06-24T04:54:37Z","updated_at":"2016-06-28T17:28:16Z","closed_at":"2016-06-28T17:28:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"326acb0dd7de076dbb7f2feb3162b341c205c36e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13884/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13884/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13884/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9316d7f0baec6d59e8a5a88cd872eca3e6720f9d","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:bug","ref":"bug","sha":"9316d7f0baec6d59e8a5a88cd872eca3e6720f9d","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn RandomForest.run(), added instrumentation for the number of node groups, along with the min, max, and average number of nodes per group.\n\nAlso fixed a typo in BaggedPoint.scala documentation.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by running RandomForestClassifierSuite, checking the test output manually to make sure instrumentation information was present and reasonable.\n","created_at":"2016-06-24T00:41:47Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T08:02:04Z","closed_at":"2017-05-18T08:02:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99d0224e731e4ece00a11d0acc4db0c6880602ac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13881/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13881/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13881/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7fb031eff488ca657e89220193866af0b39a358a","head":{"label":"smurching:random-forest-instrumentation","ref":"random-forest-instrumentation","sha":"7fb031eff488ca657e89220193866af0b39a358a","user":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61843831,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTg0MzgzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"smurching/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"smurching","id":2358483,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNTg0ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2358483?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching","html_url":"https://github.com/smurching","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smurching/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/smurching/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis removes a check that partition names match from the Hive write path, which was added as a sanity check in [SPARK-14459](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14459). The sanity check is incorrect because `partitionBy` could be used to explicitly set columns with names that don't match.\n\nThis is also no longer exercised because of changes in SPARK-16032. Now, Hive's `partition` metadata is derived from the table partitions during the analysis phase and will always match.\n","created_at":"2016-06-24T00:09:42Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T21:30:05Z","closed_at":"2016-11-01T21:30:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f61567e298bde594e7db55cf84bce017832e1630","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13880/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13880/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13880/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/919f52001f78f9b1de8a0088a3de312dd6447fae","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-16178-remove-unnecessary-hive-partition-check","ref":"SPARK-16178-remove-unnecessary-hive-partition-check","sha":"919f52001f78f9b1de8a0088a3de312dd6447fae","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR changes `CombineFilters` to compose the final predicate condition by using (`child predicate` AND `parent predicate`) instead of (`parent predicate` AND `child predicate`). This is a best effort approach. Some other optimization rules may destroy this order by reorganizing conjunctive predicates.\n\n**Reported Error Scenario**\nChris McCubbin reported a bug when he used StringIndexer in an ML pipeline with additional filters. It seems that during filter pushdown, we changed the ordering in the logical plan.\n\n``` scala\nimport org.apache.spark.ml.feature._\nval df1 = (0 until 3).map(_.toString).toDF\nval indexer = new StringIndexer()\n  .setInputCol(\"value\")\n  .setOutputCol(\"idx\")\n  .setHandleInvalid(\"skip\")\n  .fit(df1)\nval df2 = (0 until 5).map(_.toString).toDF\nval predictions = indexer.transform(df2)\npredictions.show() // this is okay\npredictions.where('idx > 2).show() // this will throw an exception\n```\n\nPlease see the notebook at

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis calculation of statistics is not trivial anymore, it could be very slow on large query (for example, TPC-DS Q64 took several minutes to plan).\n\nDuring the planning of a query, the statistics of any logical plan should not change (even InMemoryRelation), so we should use `lazy val` to cache the statistics.\n\nFor InMemoryRelation, the statistics could be updated after materialization, it's only useful when used in another query (before planning), because once we finished the planning, the statistics will not be used anymore.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTestsed with TPC-DS Q64, it could be planned in a second after the patch.\n","created_at":"2016-06-23T07:05:13Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T18:50:39Z","closed_at":"2016-06-23T18:50:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe61cfb8b4749c580736aa1b29c5331e94eedf3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13871/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13871/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13871/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/63068e2ab8d9984089c410d657bdf557d5735493","head":{"label":"davies:fix_statistics","ref":"fix_statistics","sha":"63068e2ab8d9984089c410d657bdf557d5735493","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSubqueries with deep correlation fail with ambiguous error message.\n\n**Problem repro:**\n\n``` SQL\nSeq((1, 1), (2, 2)).toDF(\"c1\", \"c2\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t1\")\nSeq((1, 1), (2, 2)).toDF(\"c1\", \"c2\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t2\")\nSeq((1, 1), (2, 2)).toDF(\"c1\", \"c2\").createOrReplaceTempView(\"t3\")\n\nsql(\"select c1 from t1 where c1 IN (select t2.c1 from t2 where t2.c2 IN (select t3.c2 from t3 where t3.c1 = t1.c1))\").show()\n\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: filter expression 'listquery()' of type array<null> is not a boolean.;\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$class.failAnalysis(CheckAnalysis.scala:40)\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.Analyzer.failAnalysis(Analyzer.scala:58)\n```\n\nBased on testing, Spark supports one level of correlation in predicate and scalar subqueries. An example of supported correlation is shown below.\n\n``` SQL\nselect c1 from t1\nwhere c1 IN (select t2.c1 from t2 where t2.c2 IN (select t3.c2 from t3 where t3.c1 = t2.c1))\n```\n\nIf the query has deep correlation, such as in the first example, where the inner subquery is correlated\nto the outer most query block, the above error message is issued. \n\nThis PR changes the error message to the following one:\n\n``` SQL\nCorrelated column in subquery cannot be resolved: t1.c1; line 5 pos 28\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Correlated column in subquery cannot be resolved: t1.c1; line 5 pos 28\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.analysis.CheckAnalysis$class.failAnalysis(CheckAnalysis.scala:40)\n```\n\n**Problem description:**\nRule ResolveSubqueries resolves subqueries by first invoking the Analyzer on the subquery tree and then attempting to resolve the correlated column references using the outer plans. If the subquery was succesfully resolved, the rule completes rewritting the subquery. Otherwise, the unresolved plan is returned. Later, CheckAnalysis will not report the original problem, but the result of cascading resolution failures. \n\n**Solution:**\nWhen resolving an UnresolvedAlias in resolveOuterReferences(), use the entire sequence of available outer plans, instead of one outer plan at a time. With this design, resolveOuterReferences() resolves any leaf expressions, or issues an error if the column cannot be resolved. Then, if the correlation is resolved, the subsequent call to execute() will resolve any references to previously unresolved correlated columns.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd new test unit to the SubquerySuite.\n","created_at":"2016-06-23T01:34:21Z","updated_at":"2017-06-29T01:14:33Z","closed_at":"2017-06-29T01:14:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0eaf44211da8ed6abef89be24b706568f1e8e2c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13867/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13867/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13867/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3d8af2ad685a6933400c89b2ec463e337bb8ff09","head":{"label":"ioana-delaney:fixErrMsg2","ref":"fixErrMsg2","sha":"3d8af2ad685a6933400c89b2ec463e337bb8ff09","user":{"login":"ioana-delaney","id":17709782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzA5Nzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17709782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-delaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":53364696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MzM2NDY5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"ioana-delaney/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ioana-delaney","id":17709782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzA5Nzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17709782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney","html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-delaney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ioana-delaney/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ioana-delaney/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen reading partitions of a partitioned Hive SerDe table, we only initializes the deserializer using partition properties. However, for SerDes like `AvroSerDe`, essential properties (e.g. Avro schema information) may be defined in table properties. We should merge both table properties and partition properties before initializing the deserializer.\n\nNote that an individual partition may have different properties than the one defined in the table properties (e.g. partitions within a table can have different SerDes). Thus, for any property key defined in both partition and table properties, the value set in partition properties wins.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test case added in `QueryPartitionSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T23:56:08Z","updated_at":"2016-06-24T06:40:18Z","closed_at":"2016-06-24T06:13:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aea4b2399e876b642ddbd45154b618b49bba2f9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13865/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13865/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13865/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/85e0eedd1d610d5c2cf486a43cda3401df856c33","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-13709-partitioned-avro-table","ref":"spark-13709-partitioned-avro-table","sha":"85e0eedd1d610d5c2cf486a43cda3401df856c33","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis WIP PR makes it possible to plug in custom dynamic allocation heuristics. I refactored the existing logic, moved things around and exposed some interfaces/config variables to enable this feature. I wanted to open this PR to get some feedback moving forward.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nWith existing unit tests and manual tests with several Spark applications that we have.\n\n/cc

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe embed partitioning logic in FileSourceStrategy.apply, making the function very long. This is a small refactoring to move it into its own functions. Eventually we would be able to move the partitioning functions into a physical operator, rather than doing it in physical planning.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a simple code

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis moves over old PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13664 to target master rather than branch-1.6.\n\nAdded links to logs (or an indication that there are no logs) for entries which list an executor in the stage details page of the UI.\n\nThis helps streamline the workflow where a user views a stage details page and determines that they would like to see the associated executor log for further examination.  Previously, a user would have to cross reference the executor id listed on the stage details page with the corresponding entry on the executors tab.\n\nLink to the JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15885\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan existing unit tests.\nRan test queries on a platform which did not record executor logs and again on a platform which did record executor logs and verified that the new table column was empty and links to the logs (which were verified as linking to the appropriate files), respectively.\n\nAttached is a screenshot of the UI page with no links, with the new columns highlighted.  Additional screenshot of these columns with the populated links.\n\nWithout links:\n![updated without

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBased on the previous discussion with @cloud-fan @hvanhovell in another related PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13764#discussion_r67994276, it looks reasonable to add convenience methods for users to add `comment` when defining `StructField`.\n\nCurrently, the column-related `comment` attribute is stored in `Metadata` of `StructField`. For example, users can add the `comment` attribute using the following way:\n\n``` Scala\nStructType(\n  StructField(\n    \"cl1\",\n    IntegerType,\n    nullable = false,\n    new MetadataBuilder().putString(\"comment\", \"test\").build()) :: Nil)\n```\n\nThis PR is to add more user friendly methods for the `comment` attribute when defining a `StructField`. After the changes, users are provided three different ways to do it:\n\n``` Scala\nval struct = (new StructType)\n  .add(\"a\", \"int\", true, \"test1\")\n\nval struct = (new StructType)\n  .add(\"c\", StringType, true, \"test3\")\n\nval struct = (new StructType)\n  .add(StructField(\"d\", StringType).withComment(\"test4\"))\n```\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases:\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPreviously, the TaskLocation implementation would not allow for executor ids which include underscores.  This tweaks the string split used to get the hostname and executor id, allowing for underscores in the executor id.\n\nThis addresses the JIRA found here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16148\n\nThis is moved over from a previous PR against branch-1.6: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13857\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan existing unit tests for core and streaming.  Manually ran a simple streaming job with an executor whose id contained underscores and confirmed that the job ran successfully.\n\nThis is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license.\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T21:21:23Z","updated_at":"2016-06-29T19:18:18Z","closed_at":"2016-06-28T20:38:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"74ee2f896bfdf9e5a2d8201cc6d1565acf948f35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13858/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13858/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13858/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ee4708d498655ef8b156a97d388501bb5bf83463","head":{"label":"tmagrino:fixtasklocation","ref":"fixtasklocation","sha":"ee4708d498655ef8b156a97d388501bb5bf83463","user":{"login":"tmagrino","id":1450821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTA4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1450821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino","html_url":"https://github.com/tmagrino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61050241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTA1MDI0MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tmagrino/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tmagrino","id":1450821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTA4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1450821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino","html_url":"https://github.com/tmagrino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tmagrino/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPreviously, the TaskLocation implementation would not allow for executor ids which include underscores.  This tweaks the string split used to get the hostname and executor id, allowing for underscores in the executor id.\n\nThis addresses the JIRA found here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-16148\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan existing unit tests for core and streaming.  Manually ran a simple streaming job with an executor whose id contained underscores and confirmed that the job ran successfully.\n\nThis is my original work and I license the work to the project under the project's open source license.\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T20:46:13Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T21:02:35Z","closed_at":"2016-06-22T21:02:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c04dc9207176a5485cdf7826101c4a7f8b1b9b7d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13857/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13857/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13857/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00fa60132e8f069e2eb1fb8fa4b0d39ccbb32cff","head":{"label":"tmagrino:tasklocationfix","ref":"tasklocationfix","sha":"00fa60132e8f069e2eb1fb8fa4b0d39ccbb32cff","user":{"login":"tmagrino","id":1450821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTA4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1450821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino","html_url":"https://github.com/tmagrino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61050241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTA1MDI0MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tmagrino/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tmagrino","id":1450821,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTA4MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1450821?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino","html_url":"https://github.com/tmagrino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tmagrino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tmagrino/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn 1.4 and earlier releases, we have package grouping in the generated Java API docs. See http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.4.0/api/java/index.html. However, this disappeared in 1.5.0: http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.5.0/api/java/index.html.\n\nRather than fixing it, I'd suggest removing grouping. Because it might take some time to fix and it is a manual process to update the grouping in `SparkBuild.scala`. I didn't find anyone complaining about missing groups since 1.5.0 on Google.\n\nManually checked the generated Java API docs and confirmed that they are the same as in master.\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T20:35:50Z","updated_at":"2016-06-22T22:54:20Z","closed_at":"2016-06-22T22:54:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b0a9428974585c7dc44be17cc13d6c5c770d2d75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13856/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13856/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13856/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db0859e5aa85cb1d20df7838232818d9b2ad2564","head":{"label":"mengxr:SPARK-16155","ref":"SPARK-16155","sha":"db0859e5aa85cb1d20df7838232818d9b2ad2564","user":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17278743,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzI3ODc0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"mengxr/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mengxr","id":829644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyOTY0NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr","html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mengxr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mengxr/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nTaskManagerSuite \"Kill other task attempts when one attempt belonging to the same task succeeds\" was flaky.  When checking whether a task is speculatable, at least one millisecond must pass since the task was submitted.  Use a manual clock to avoid the problem.\n\nI noticed these tests were leaving lots of threads lying around as well (which prevented me from running the test repeatedly), so I fixed that too.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nRan the test 1k times on my laptop, passed every time (it failed about 20% of the time before this).\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T15:25:06Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T21:57:57Z","closed_at":"2016-06-27T21:34:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"990a1894c8194b639ede2c9fa85f7d39d4d127de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13848/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13848/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13848/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/47bb5df09b491654611d2be91cd9424457594d45","head":{"label":"squito:fix_flaky_taskmanagersuite","ref":"fix_flaky_taskmanagersuite","sha":"47bb5df09b491654611d2be91cd9424457594d45","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds 3 optimizer rules for typed filter:\n1. push typed filter down through `SerializeFromObject` and eliminate the deserialization in filter condition.\n2. pull typed filter up through `SerializeFromObject` and eliminate the deserialization in filter condition.\n3. combine adjacent typed filters and share the deserialized object among all the condition expressions.\n\nThis PR also adds `TypedFilter` logical plan, to separate it from normal filter, so that the concept is more clear and it's easier to write optimizer rules.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`TypedFilterOptimizationSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T14:21:11Z","updated_at":"2016-06-30T00:19:48Z","closed_at":"2016-06-30T00:16:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c58e3255b7b06cf309a2cb0cfbe4b9dd75301aa6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13846/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13846/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13846/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a2241f722d9e89f4eb4b6d4a8cc3636884454e0","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:filter","ref":"filter","sha":"1a2241f722d9e89f4eb4b6d4a8cc3636884454e0","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes incorrect checking for `root` module (meaning all tests).\n\nI realised that https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13806 is being failed due to this one.\n\nThe PR corrects two files in `sql` and `core`. Since it seems fixing `core` module triggers all tests by `root` value from `determine_modules_for_files`.\nSo, `changed_modules` becomes as below:\n\n```\n['root', 'sql']\n```\n\nand `module.dependent_modules` becaomes as below:\n\n```\n['pyspark-mllib', 'pyspark-ml', 'hive-thriftserver', 'sparkr', 'mllib', 'examples', 'pyspark-sql']\n```\n\nNow, `modules_to_test` does not include `root` and this checking is skipped but then both `changed_modules` and `modules_to_test` are being merged after that. So, this includes `root` module to test.\n\nThis ends up with failing with the message below (e.g. https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/job/SparkPullRequestBuilder/60990/consoleFull):\n\n```\nError: unrecognized module 'root'. Supported modules: pyspark-core, pyspark-sql, pyspark-streaming, pyspark-ml, pyspark-mllib\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nN/A\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T13:25:07Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:40:15Z","closed_at":"2016-06-28T00:44:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8d54bfb5d81a91f421ddac56671b52269ea0fd9b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13845/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13845/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13845/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6e72652b9b32b40cccaa20eaf2f9936ec3105812","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:fix-build-1.6","ref":"fix-build-1.6","sha":"6e72652b9b32b40cccaa20eaf2f9936ec3105812","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen users do not specify the path in `DataFrameReader` APIs, it can get a confusing error message. For example, \n\n``` Scala\nspark.read.json()\n```\n\nError message:\n\n```\nUnable to infer schema for JSON at . It must be specified manually;\n```\n\nAfter the fix, the error message will be like: \n\n```\n'path' is not specified\n```\n\nAnother major goal of this PR is to add test cases for the latest changes in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13727. \n- orc read APIs\n- illegal format name\n- save API - empty path or illegal path\n- load API - empty path\n- illegal compression\n- fixed a test case in the existing test case `prevent all column partitioning`\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nTest cases are added.\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T06:35:43Z","updated_at":"2017-05-18T08:02:04Z","closed_at":"2017-05-18T08:02:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"09c68aa51f77d20991403dc22187e2b02908f163","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13837/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13837/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13837/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/45110370fb1889f244a6750ef2a18dbc9f1ba9c2","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:dfWriterAudit","ref":"dfWriterAudit","sha":"45110370fb1889f244a6750ef2a18dbc9f1ba9c2","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe root cause is in `MapObjects`. Its parameter `loopVar` is not declared as child, but sometimes can be same with `lambdaFunction`(e.g. the function that takes `loopVar` and produces `lambdaFunction` may be `identity`), which is a child. This brings trouble when call `withNewChildren`, it may mistakenly treat `loopVar` as a child and cause `IndexOutOfBoundsException: 0` later.\n\nThis PR fixes this bug by simply pulling out the paremters from `LambdaVariable` and pass them to `MapObjects` directly.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in

option is used by Hive to directly delete the files instead of\nmoving them to the trash. This is needed in certain configurations\nwhere moving the files does not work. For non-Hive tables and partitions,\nSpark already behaves as if the PURGE option was set, so there's no\nneed to do anything.\n\nHive support for PURGE was added in 0.14 (for tables) and 1.2 (for\npartitions), so the code reflects that: trying to use the option with\nolder versions of Hive will cause an exception to be thrown.\n\nThe change is a little noisier than I would like, because of the code\nto propagate the new flag through all the interfaces and implementations;\nthe main changes are in the parser and in HiveShim, aside from the tests\n(DDLCommandSuite, VersionsSuite).\n\nTested by running sql and catalyst unit tests, plus VersionsSuite which\nhas been updated to test the version-specific behavior. I also ran an\ninternal test suite that uses PURGE and would not pass previously.\n","created_at":"2016-06-22T00:34:30Z","updated_at":"2016-07-12T19:54:23Z","closed_at":"2016-07-12T19:49:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c13829f3cf30ac5e840aba2261253205da365741","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13831/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13831/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13831/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f5fcc84e346d7c65787f3fc65c57bfd6603a8903","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-16119","ref":"SPARK-16119","sha":"f5fcc84e346d7c65787f3fc65c57bfd6603a8903","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror
