Currently there is a BigQuery Hook named `run_table_upsert` but there is no BigQuery Table Upsert Operator utilizing this hook. This PR includes a new GCP BigQuery Operator to include this.\r\n\r\n2. This new operator allows updating the given table with given parameters or else creates a new table if it is not already present.\r\n\r\n3.

a potential fix to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5167 this commit changes outdated hard-pinned dependencies to rolling dependencies.\r\n\r\nWhile both pinned and rolling have their pros and cons, in this situation, it might be best to just deal with the bugs from rolling breaking changes as they pop up.\r\n\r\nAlternately, we should re-pin from time to time with totally hard-pinned deps. What we currently have here is a mix, so it should change one way or the other.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-5167](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-5167/)\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [X] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

documentation for the `none_failed` trigger rule\r\n(https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/concepts.html#trigger-rules)\r\ndescribes its behavior as \"all parents have not failed (`failed` or\r\n`upstream_failed`) i.e. all parents have succeeded or been skipped.\"\r\nWith that definition in mind, there is no reason that the check for\r\n`none_failed` should ever have to check for skipped upstream tasks or\r\nset the current task to `skipped`. The current behavior causes the rule\r\nto skip if all upstream tasks have skipped, which is more than a little\r\nconfusing. This fixes the behavior to be consistent with the documentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: [AIRFLOW-4453](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-4453)\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [X] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`.

of the executors run local task jobs by running `airflow tasks run ...`. This is achieved by passing  `['airflow', 'tasks', 'run', ...]` object to subprocess.check_call. \r\n\r\nThis is very limiting when creating new executors that do not necessarily want to start a new process when starting a local task job, e.g. fork a process instead of create.\r\n\r\nWe could achieve a similar effect if we process back the argument list, but this is an ugly and hack solution, so I did refactor the code and now the executor passes the LocalTaskJobDeferredRun object that contains all the detailed information. A particular executor could create a command if it needs it.\r\n\r\nThis will facilitate the development of other executors:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-29%3A+AWS+Fargate+Executor (@aelzeiny)\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-28%3A+Add+AsyncExecutor+option (@dazza-codes)\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-25+The+Knative+Executor (@dimberman \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/6750 (@nuclearpinguin )\r\nThis also made the DebugExecutor code simpler.

 Congratulations on your first Pull Request and welcome to the Apache Airflow community!\r\n  If you have any issues or are unsure about any anything please check our\r\n  Contribution Guide (https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst)\r\n\r\n  Here are some useful points:\r\n   - Check the quality of your code (flake8, pylint and type annotations). Our [pre-commits](\r\n   https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/STATIC_CODE_CHECKS.rst#prerequisites-for-pre-commit-hooks)\r\n   will help you with that.\r\n   - In case of a new feature add useful documentation (in docstrings or in `docs/` directory).\r\n   Adding a new operator? Consider adding an example DAG that shows how users should use it.\r\n   - Consider using [Breeze environment](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/BREEZE.rst) for testing locally, it’s a heavy docker but it ships with a working Airflow and a lot of integrations.\r\n   - Be patient and persistent. It might take some time to get a review or get the final approval from\r\n   Committers.\r\n\r\n  Apache Airflow is a community-driven project and together we are making it better 🚀\r\n\r\n  In case of doubts contact the developers at:\r\n  Mailing List: dev@airflow.apache.org\r\n  Slack: https://apache-airflow-slack.herokuapp.com/\r\n\r\n---\r\nIssue link: `Document only change, no JIRA issue`\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Commit message/PR title starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`. AIRFLOW-NNNN = JIRA ID<sup>*</sup>\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\n- [x] Commits follow \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n- [x] Relevant documentation is updated including usage instructions.\r\n- [x] I will engage committers as explained in [Contribution Workflow Example](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-workflow-example).\r\n\r\n<sup>*</sup> For document-only changes commit message can start with `[AIRFLOW-XXXX]`.\r\n\r\n---\r\nIn case of fundamental code change, Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvements+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party License Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-x).\r\nIn case of backwards incompatible changes please leave a note in [UPDATING.md](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md).\r\nRead the [Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#pull-request-guidelines) for more

tried to use `SparkSubmitOperator` using standalone cluster first. Unfortunately, the `spark-submit` task was failed. The following exception occurred.\r\n```\r\nairflow.exceptions.AirflowException: Cannot execute: [path/to/spark-submit, '--master', host:port, job_file.py]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first thing that came up into my mind was why the master address excluded the `spark://` prefix. So it should be like `--master spark://host:port`. I performed a quick check to the source code and found that such a thing (scheme addition) hadn't been handled.\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the subsequent method callings, it turned out that the driver status tracking feature won't be utilised at all because of the above bug. Look at the following code snippet.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _resolve_should_track_driver_status(self):\r\n\t\"\"\"\r\n\tDetermines whether to not this hook should poll the spark driver status through subsequent spark-submit status requests after the initial spark-submit request\r\n\t:return: if the driver status should be tracked\r\n\t\"\"\"\r\n\treturn ('spark://' in self._connection['master'] and self._connection['deploy_mode'] == 'cluster')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above method will always return `False` as the spark master's address doesn't start with the scheme, such as `spark://`.\r\n\r\nLater on, I investigated the `Connection` module (_airflow.models.connection_) further and found that if we provide the URI (ex: _spark://host:port_), then the attributes of the `Connection` object will be derived via URI parsing.\r\n\r\nWhen parsing the host, the resulting value was only the hostname without the scheme. It also becomes a critical enough bug.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution**\r\n\r\nI think we don't really need the whole URI. I mean, when we store the connection data as an environment variable, we could just specify the URI parts in form of JSON. This approach is mainly used to tackle the URI parsing problem.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the `conn_id` will still be preserved.\r\n\r\nTake a look at the following example (`conn_id` = \"spark_default\"). For simplicity, let's presume that `extra` is in JSON form.\r\n\r\n```\r\nAIRFLOW_CONN_SPARK_DEFAULT='{\"conn_type\": <conn_type>, \"host\":<host>, \"port\":<port>, \"schema\":<schema>, \"extra\":<extra>}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven though this solution could reduce the false result returned by URI parsing, one need to strictly ensure that each attribute (host, port, scheme, etc.) should store the relevant value. I think it's much easier than creating a correct URI parser. Moreover, applying such a technique makes the whole connection data builder for both database & environment variable mode have the same pattern (both use a structured data specification).\r\n\r\n---\r\nLink to JIRA issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-6212\r\n\r\n- [X] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [X] Commit message starts with `[AIRFLOW-NNNN]`, where AIRFLOW-NNNN = JIRA ID*\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for changes (not needed for documentation changes)\r\n- [X] Commits follow \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n- [x] Relevant documentation is updated including usage instructions.\r\n- [ ] I will engage committers as explained in [Contribution Workflow Example](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst#contribution-workflow-example).\r\n\r\n(*) For document-only changes, no JIRA issue is needed.

am not sure, but I suspect that when the test is marked as flaky, the time without writing to the console exceed the Travis limits, because maximum time is performed repeatedly, and in the meantime, nothing is written on the screen.  Unfortunately, after 10 minutes Travis stops the job.\r\n\r\nI suggest drastically reducing this timeout . This will also prevent the introduction of a test that would slow down our CI. I chose the value of 90 seconds based on the list of slowest tests (available below).  The slowest test takes 50s, so 90 seconds is a sensible value. Travis CI can sometimes be overloaded, so 50 seconds can be dangerous.\r\n\r\n```\r\n========================== slowest 100 test durations ==========================\r\n50.11s call
