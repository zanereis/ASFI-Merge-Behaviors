`KafkaMetadataLog` implementation of `ReplicatedLog` validates that batches appended using `appendAsLeader` and `appendAsFollower` have an offset that matches the LEO. This is enforced by `KafkaRaftClient` and `BatchAccumulator`. When creating control batches for the `LeaderChangeMessage` the default base offset of `0` was being used instead of using the LEO. This is fixed by:\r\n\r\n1. Changing the implementation for `MockLog` to validate against this and throw an `RuntimeException` if this invariant is violated.\r\n2.

PR adds the KIP-500 `BrokerServer` and `ControllerServer` classes.  It makes the following changes to accommodate them:\r\n\r\n- `SocketServer` now accepts optional endpoints in `startup()` so that it can work in a `BrokerToControllerChannelManager` that needs to talk to the Raft-based controllers (whose end points are defined differently in the config).\r\n- There is a `RaftControllerNodeProvider` implementation for use with `BrokerToControllerChannelManager`\r\n- `AutoTopicCreationManager` now accepts `Option[]`s for `ZkAdminManager` and `KafkaController` since those are not used with Raft-based metadata quorums.\r\n- We add the epoch parameter in `RaftClient.handleResign(epoch)` because the epoch is required by `MetaLogListener.handleRenounce(epoch)`\r\n- We return a random active Broker ID as the Controller ID in `MetadataResponse` for the Raft-based case as per KIP-590.\r\n- We add `object EnvelopeUtils` to hold common code related to KIP-590 envelope processing.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

is a simple change to MockProducer as per request in KAFKA-12297.\r\nMockProducer currently returns a null RecordMetadata on Exception.

patch changes the NetworkClient behavior to resolve the target node's hostname after disconnecting from an established connection, rather than waiting until the previously-resolved addresses are exhausted. This is to handle the scenario when the node's IP addresses have changed during the lifetime of the connection, and means that the client does not have to try to connect to invalid IP addresses until it has tried each address.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Mickael Maison <mickael.maison@gmail.com>, Satish Duggana <satishd@apache.org>, David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

patch changes the NetworkClient behavior to resolve the target node's hostname after disconnecting from an established connection, rather than waiting until the previously-resolved addresses are exhausted. This is to handle the scenario when the node's IP addresses have changed during the lifetime of the connection, and means that the client does not have to try to connect to invalid IP addresses until it has tried each address.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Mickael Maison <mickael.maison@gmail.com>, Satish Duggana <satishd@apache.org>, David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

a new `sanity_checks/bounce_test.py` system test for a simple produce/bounce/produce series of events.  Augments this and other `sanity_checks` tests so they run all metadata quorum types: ZooKeeper, remote Raft, and co-located Raft.\r\n\r\nAugments several `tests/client` and `tests/core` system tests to run for remote Raft-based metadata quorums in addition to ZooKeeper.  Co-located Raft controllers are not tested here as this configuration is presumed to work assuming `sanity_checks` as well as any unit/integration tests pass.\r\n\r\nAugments a simple set of tests in `tests/connect`, `tests/streams`, and `tests/tools` to run for remote Raft-based metadata quorums in addition to ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\nAdds missing `@cluster` annotations for dozens of system tests that were missing them -- this was causing these tests to grab the entire cluster of nodes and negatively impact the parallelism of the system test run.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

Kafka Metadata shell is a new command which allows users to\r\ninteractively examine the metadata stored in a KIP-500 cluster.\r\n\r\nIt can read the metadata from the controllers directly, by connecting to\r\nthem, or from a metadata snapshot on disk.  In the former case, the\r\nquorum voters must be specified by passing the --controllers flag; in\r\nthe latter case, the snapshot file should be specified via --snapshot.\r\n\r\nThe metadata tool works by replaying the log and storing the state into\r\nin-memory nodes.

need to be able to run system tests with Raft-based metadata quorums -- both co-located brokers and controllers as well as remote controllers -- in addition to the ZooKepeer-based mode we run today.  This PR adds this capability to `KafkaService` in a backwards-compatible manner as follows.\r\n\r\nIf no changes are made to existing system tests then they function as they always do -- they instantiate ZooKeeper, and Kafka will use ZooKeeper.  A good test of this PR is therefore to run a full system test suite with no actual test changes and make sure everything runs as expected.\r\n\r\nIf we want to use a Raft-based metadata quorum we can do so by introducing a `metadata_quorum` argument to the test method and using `@matrix` to set it to the quorums we want to use for the various runs of the test.  We then also have to skip creating a `ZooKeeperService` when the quorum is Raft-based.\r\n\r\nFor example, we would do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom ducktape.mark import matrix\r\nfrom kafkatest.services.kafka import KafkaService, quorum\r\n```\r\n```\r\n    def __init__(self, test_context):\r\n        super(TestVerifiableProducer, self).__init__(test_context)\r\n        self.zk = ZookeeperService(test_context, num_nodes=1) if quorum.for_test(test_context) == quorum.zk else None\r\n        self.kafka = KafkaService(test_context, num_nodes=1, zk=self.zk,\r\n                                  topics={\"topic\": {\"partitions\": 1, \"replication-factor\": 1}})\r\n```\r\n```\r\n    def setUp(self):\r\n        if self.zk:\r\n            self.zk.start()\r\n        self.kafka.start()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n    @cluster(num_nodes=3)\r\n    @matrix(producer_version=[str(DEV_BRANCH)], metadata_quorum=quorum.all)\r\n    def test_simple_run(self, producer_version=DEV_BRANCH, metadata_quorum=quorum.zk):\r\n        # the rest of the test logic remains unchanged\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above will end up running 3 separate tests: one with ZooKeeper, one with a co-located Raft-based controller, and once with a remote Raft-based controller.\r\n\r\nIf we want to set security protocols we could do this:\r\n```\r\n    def setUp(self):\r\n        if self.zk:\r\n            self.zk.start()\r\n        # don't start Kafka here because we haven't configured security at this point\r\n```\r\n```\r\n    @cluster(num_nodes=3)\r\n    @matrix(producer_version=[str(DEV_BRANCH)], security_protocol=['PLAINTEXT', 'SSL'], metadata_quorum=quorum.all)\r\n    @cluster(num_nodes=4)\r\n    @matrix(producer_version=[str(DEV_BRANCH)], security_protocol=['SASL_SSL'], sasl_mechanism=['PLAIN', 'GSSAPI'],\r\n            metadata_quorum=quorum.all)\r\n    def test_simple_run(self, producer_version, security_protocol = 'PLAINTEXT', sasl_mechanism='PLAIN',\r\n                        metadata_quorum=quorum.zk):\r\n        self.kafka.security_protocol = security_protocol\r\n        self.kafka.client_sasl_mechanism = sasl_mechanism\r\n        self.kafka.interbroker_security_protocol = security_protocol\r\n        self.kafka.interbroker_sasl_mechanism = sasl_mechanism\r\n        if self.kafka.quorum_info.using_raft:\r\n            controller_quorum = self.kafka.controller_quorum\r\n            controller_quorum.controller_security_protocol = security_protocol\r\n            controller_quorum.controller_sasl_mechanism = sasl_mechanism\r\n            controller_quorum.intercontroller_security_protocol = security_protocol\r\n            controller_quorum.intercontroller_sasl_mechanism = sasl_mechanism\r\n        # now we can start Kafka\r\n        self.kafka.start()\r\n        # the rest of the test logic remains unchanged\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR does not update any tests -- those will come later after all the KIP-500 code is merged.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

bug can be easily reproduced for any TimeWindow where window + grace period > 1 day. Changing any test in TimeWindowedKStreamImplTest.java for this condition will reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\n**Cause:**\r\nThe root cause is that .grace(...) never updates the default maintainDurationMs field value. The value is thus always 1 day - throwing the IllegalArgumentException when validating it at a later stage.\r\n\r\n**Implementation comments:**\r\nI believe that a minimum retention period of 1 day is desired because of log compaction - thus I used the Math.Max(window+grace, default maintainDurationMs-1 day-) to calculate the minimum retention period.\r\n\r\nI am a bit unsure about the test - currently it indirectly tests the bug. The bug would throw a IllegalArgumentException, preventing the test scenario from working with any aggregation (count, reduce, etc). I've implemented the test with count operation to ensure consistency of the window behaviour. If this is not required, maybe just calling processData() and asserting that the original reported exception is not thrown should be enough. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

Raft Snapshot loading API.\r\n\r\n1. Adds a new method `handleSnapshot` to `raft.Listener` which is called whenever the `RaftClient` determines that the `Listener` needs to load a new snapshot before reading the log. This happens when the `Listener`'s next offset is less than the log start offset also known as the earliest snapshot.\r\n\r\n2.  Adds a new type `SnapshotReader<T>` which provides a `Iterator<Batch<T>>` interface and de-serializes records in the `RawSnapshotReader` into `T`s\r\n\r\n3.  Adds a new type `RecordsIterator<T>` that implements an `Iterator<Batch<T>>` by scanning a `Records` object and deserializes the batches and records into `Batch<T>`. This type is used by both `SnapshotReader<T>` and `RecordsBatchReader<T>` internally to implement the `Iterator` interface that they expose. \r\n\r\n4. Changes the `MockLog` implementation to read one batch at a time. The previous implementation always read from the given offset to the high-watermark. This made it impossible to test interesting snapshot loading scenarios.\r\n\r\n5. Removed `throws IOException` from some methods. Some of types were inconsistently throwing `IOException` in some cases and throwing `RuntimeException(..., new IOException(...))` in others. This PR improves the consistent by wrapping `IOException` in `RuntimeException` in a few more places and replacing `Closeable` with `AutoCloseable`.\r\n\r\n6. Updated the Kafka Raft simulation test to take into account snapshot. `ReplicatedCounter` was updated to generate snapshot after 10 records get committed. This means that the `ConsistentCommittedData` validation was extended to take snapshots into account.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-12309\r\n\r\n# issue description\r\nWhen adding a new worker, the revocation algorithm tries to revoke some connectors/tasks from existent workers so as to move them to new worker to balance load. However, the algorithm can revoke incorrect number of connectors/tasks for following cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Assignments:\r\n\"worker_0\" -> 8 connectors/tasks\r\n\"worker_1\" -> 8 connectors/tasks\r\n(New) \"worker_2\" -> 0 connectors/tasks\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\"worker_0\" -> 6 connectors/tasks\r\n\"worker_1\" -> 6 connectors/tasks\r\n\"worker_2\" -> 4 connectors/tasks\r\n\r\n### (expected) Result\r\n\"worker_0\" -> 6 connectors/tasks\r\n\"worker_1\" -> 5 connectors/tasks\r\n\"worker_2\" -> 5 connectors/tasks\r\nor \r\n\"worker_0\" -> 5 connectors/tasks\r\n\"worker_1\" -> 6 connectors/tasks\r\n\"worker_2\" -> 5 connectors/tasks\r\n\r\n# root cause\r\nthe algorithm makes all existent workers keep `ceil` (`numToRevoke = existing.tasksSize() - ceilTasks;`) connectors/tasks.

from Jira):\r\n\r\nThe `Flatten` SMT fails for array types. A sophisticated approach that tries to flatten arrays might be desirable in some cases, and may have been punted during the early design phase of the transform, but in the interim, it's probably not worth it to make array data and the SMT mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\nA naive approach that preserves arrays as-are and doesn't attempt to flatten them seems fair for now.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

quorum controller stores metadata in the KIP-500 metadata log, not in Apache ZooKeeper.  Each controller node is a voter in the metadata quorum.  The leader of the quorum is the active controller, which processes write requests.  The followers are standby controllers, which replay the operations written to the log.  If the active controller goes away, a standby controller can take its place.\r\n\r\nLike the ZooKeeper-based controller, the quorum controller is based on an event queue backed by a single-threaded executor.  However, unlike the ZK-based controller, the quorum controller can have multiple operations in flight-- it does not need to wait for one operation to be finished before starting another.  Therefore, calls into the QuorumController return CompleteableFuture objects which are completed with either a result or an error when the operation is done.  The QuorumController will also time out operations that have been sitting on the queue too long without being processed.  In this case, the future is completed with a TimeoutException.\r\n\r\nThe controller uses timeline data structures to store multiple \"versions\" of its in-memory state simultaneously.  \"Read operations\" read only committed state, which is slightly older than the most up-to-date in-memory state.  \"Write operations\" read and write the latest in-memory state.  However, we can not return a successful result for a write operation until its state has been committed to the log.  Therefore, if a client receives an RPC response, it knows that the requested operation has been performed, and can not be undone by a controller

adds the logic to apply partition metadata when consuming from the Raft-based metadata log.\r\n\r\n`RaftReplicaManager` extends `ReplicaManager` for now to minimize changes to existing code for the 2.8 release.  We will likely adjust this hierarchy at a later time (e.g. introducing a trait and adding a helper to refactor common code).  For now, we expose the necessary fields and methods in `ReplicaManager` by changing their scope from `private` to `protected`, and we refactor out a couple of pieces of logic that are shared between the two implementation (stopping replicas and adding log dir fetchers).\r\n\r\nExisting tests are sufficient to expose regressions in the current `ReplicaManager`.\r\n\r\nWe intend to exercise the new `RaftReplicaManager` code via system tests and unit/integration tests (both to come in later PRs).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-05T16:36:13Z","updated_at":"2021-02-10T22:37:17Z","closed_at":"2021-02-10T22:37:17Z","merged_at":"2021-02-10T22:37:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"31a647f5adf0d1ff8f190cccc0da900cfbaf2756","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/10069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/10069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/68635d6ac117ea62a11cd7b83812264398556d9e","head":{"label":"rondagostino:kip500_ReplicaManager4Raft","ref":"kip500_ReplicaManager4Raft","sha":"68635d6ac117ea62a11cd7b83812264398556d9e","user":{"login":"rondagostino","id":6076159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzYxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6076159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino","html_url":"https://github.com/rondagostino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":117853091,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTc4NTMwOTE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"rondagostino/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rondagostino","id":6076159,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNzYxNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6076159?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino","html_url":"https://github.com/rondagostino","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rondagostino/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rondagostino/kafka","description":"Mirror

patch changes the NetworkClient behavior to resolve the target node's hostname after disconnecting from an established connection, rather than waiting until the previously-resolved addresses are exhausted. This is to handle the scenario when the node's IP addresses have changed during the lifetime of the connection, and means that the client does not have to try to connect to invalid IP addresses until it has tried each address.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Mickael Maison <mickael.maison@gmail.com>, Satish Duggana <satishd@apache.org>, David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

KIP-500, we have more complex requirements on API accessibility. Previously all APIs were accessible on every listener exposed by the broker, but now that is no longer true. For example:\r\n\r\n- the controller exposes some APIs which are not accessible on the broker listener (e.g. quorum/registration/heartbeat APIs)\r\n- most of the client APIs are not exposed on the controller (e.g. consumer group apis)\r\n- there are some APIs which are not implemented by the KIP-500 broker (e.g. `LeaderAndIsr` and `UpdateMetadata`)\r\n- there are some APIs which are only implemented by the KIP-500 broker (e.g. `DecommissionBroker` and `DescribeQuorum`)\r\n\r\nAll of this means that we need more sophistication in how we expose APIs and keep them consistent with the `ApiVersions` API. Up to now, we have been working around this using the `controllerOnly` flag inside `ApiKeys`, but this is not rich enough to support all of the cases listed above.\r\n\r\nIn this patch, we address this by problem by introducing a new `listeners` field to the request schema definitions. This field is an array of strings which indicate the listener types in which the API should be exposed. We currently support the following listener types: \r\n\r\n- `zkBroker`: old broker\r\n- `broker`: kip-500 broker\r\n- `controller`: kip-500 controller\r\n\r\nFor example, the `DecommissionBroker` API has the following listeners tag:\r\n```json\r\n  \"listeners\": [\"broker\", \"controller\"]\r\n```\r\nThis indicates that the API is only on the KIP-500 broker and controller (both are needed because the request will be sent by clients and forwarded to the controller).\r\n\r\nThe patch changes the generator so that the listener type definitions are added to `ApiMessageType` and exposed through convenient helpers. At the same time, we have removed the `controllerOnly` flag from `ApiKeys` since now we can identify all controller APIs through the \"controller\" tag.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the patch is dedicated to ensuring that the API listener type is properly set and that the APIs accordingly tagged are carried through to the `ApiVersionsResponse`. We have created a new `ApiVersionManager` which encapsulates the creation of the `ApiVersionsResponse` based on the listener type. Additionally, `SocketServer` is modified to ensure the listener type of received requests before forwarding them to the request handler.\r\n\r\nWe have also fixed a bug in the handling of the `ApiVersionsResponse` prior to authentication. Previously a static response was sent, which means that changes to features would not get reflected. This also meant that the logic to ensure that only the intersection of version ranges supported by the controller would get exposed did not work. I think this is important because some clients rely on the initial pre-authenticated `ApiVersions` response rather than doing a second round after authentication as the Java client does.\r\n\r\nOne final cleanup note: I have removed the expectation that envelope requests are only allowed on \"privileged\" listeners. This made sense initially because we expected to use forwarding before the KIP-500 controller was available. That is not the case anymore and we expect the `Envelope` API to only be exposed on the controller listener. I have nevertheless preserved the existing workarounds to allow verification of the forwarding behavior in integration testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [

patch changes the NetworkClient behavior to resolve the target node's hostname after disconnecting from an established connection, rather than waiting until the previously-resolved addresses are exhausted. This is to handle the scenario when the node's IP addresses have changed during the lifetime of the connection, and means that the client does not have to try to connect to invalid IP addresses until it has tried each address.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Mickael Maison <mickael.maison@gmail.com>, Satish Duggana <satishd@apache.org>, David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

method intends to increase a chance to have KeyValueIterator closed\r\nafter usage, by providing a convenient performAndClose() default method which\r\nexecutes a given operation and guarantee to automatically close the iterator\r\nright after.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI decided to create that PR observing in different projects how often an iterator is left open after performing operations such as \r\n`.forEachRemaining(...)` (who reads JavaDoc after all? ;-) ). For people aware of the problem, instead of verbose try-with-resources constructions repeated in every place in code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry (KeyValueIterator<String, Order> ordersKeyValueIterator =\r\n         streamsBuilderFactoryBean\r\n             .getKafkaStreams()\r\n             .store(StoreQueryParameters.fromNameAndType(ORDERS_STORE,\r\n                 QueryableStoreTypes.<String, Order>keyValueStore()))\r\n             .all()) {\r\n    ordersKeyValueIterator\r\n        .forEachRemaining(kv -> {\r\n            ...\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n(or hidden in in-house built utility classes)\r\n\r\na developer using Kafka Streams has a built-in clear way to perform operations on elements contained in an iterator (and have that stream closed after that automatically):\r\n```\r\nstreamsBuilderFactoryBean\r\n    .getKafkaStreams()\r\n    .store(StoreQueryParameters.fromNameAndType(ORDERS_STORE,\r\n        QueryableStoreTypes.<String, OrderRequest>keyValueStore()))\r\n    .all()\r\n    .performAndClose(iterator -> iterator\r\n        .forEachRemaining(kv -> {\r\n            ...\r\n        })\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe it can increase a rate of closed iterator in user projects.\r\n\r\n### Testing approach\r\n\r\nBeing a default method in KeyValueIterator, I decided to test it using KeyValueIteratorFacade which already provides a nice unit testing infrastructure with mocked iterator. I don't know the implementation details, but I expect to have it behaved similarly in other implementations.\r\nI might miss some extra cases, so feel free to point them and I will happily cover them with tests.\r\n\r\n### Rejected extensions\r\n\r\nFor some time past, I was thinking also about covering operations that returns some value. However, at least in projects I've been observing the usage of Kafka Streams, performing side effects is more popular and implementation for that use cases might be more tricky and I decided to start with pure Consumer.\r\n\r\n### Other information\r\n\r\nNaming is not my area of expertise. Feel free to propose any better name or any other possible enhancements to my MR :-).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-04T23:46:22Z","updated_at":"2025-01-01T03:41:22Z","closed_at":"2025-01-01T03:41:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null},{"id":2129035451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTI5MDM1NDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kip","name":"kip","color":"a01d16","default":false,"description":"Requires

patch changes the NetworkClient behavior to resolve the target node's hostname after disconnecting from an established connection, rather than waiting until the previously-resolved addresses are exhausted. This is to handle the scenario when the node's IP addresses have changed during the lifetime of the connection, and means that the client does not have to try to connect to invalid IP addresses until it has tried each address.\r\n\r\nReviewers: Mickael Maison <mickael.maison@gmail.com>, Satish Duggana <satishd@apache.org>, David Jacot <djacot@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

suggested by @omkreddy in this [comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-8562?focusedCommentId=16912437&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16912437), implemented avoiding (reverse) DNS lookup while building underlying SslTransportLayer.\r\n\r\nHow the problem was manifested:\r\nWhen clients or other brokers are connecting to a broker using SASL_SSL, a broker was doing (reverse) DNS lookup and if there is no PTR Record, the lookup could last several seconds, which in the end caused big latencies on several parts of the system... replication, consume requests and produce requests.\r\nHere you can see a recorded sample: \r\n<img width=\"1357\" alt=\"KAFKA-8562 reverse DNS sampling\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1514332/106959147-9033a580-673a-11eb-9575-4b9fe986cb30.png\">\r\nAlso, here is a Wireshark packet capture for DNS requests, and in this case you can see that it lasted more then 11 seconds:\r\n![KAFKA-8562 wireshark dns packet capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1514332/106960332-37650c80-673c-11eb-91ab-9cab8dd4873d.png)\r\nWhen using PLAINTEXT or SSL, this problem doesn't manifest.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nIn #2835 , @rajinisivaram already added a helper method `SslChannelBuilder.peerHost`, so I just moved it to a new class called

is configured differently when it is used in a broker with a Raft-based controller quorum vs. a ZooKeeper quorum.  For example, when using Raft, `ForwardingManager` is required rather than optional, and there is no `AdminManager`, `KafkaController`, or `KafkaZkClient`.  This PR introduces `MetadataSupport` to abstract the two possibilities: `ZkSupport` and `RaftSupport`.  This provides a fluent way to decide what to do based on the type of support that `KafkaApis` has been configured with.  Certain types of requests are not supported when using raft (`AlterIsrRequest`, `UpdateMetadataRequest`, etc.), and `MetadataSupport` gives us an intuitive way to identify the constraints and requirements associated with the different configurations and react accordingly.\r\n\r\nExisting tests are sufficient to detect bugs and regressions.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from
