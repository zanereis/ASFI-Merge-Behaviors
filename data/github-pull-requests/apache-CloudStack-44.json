Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nAdd Support for InfluxDB on StatsCollector.\r\n\r\nThe collector is defined on the URI scheme. The _Global Settings_ configuration with the name `stats.output.uri` is used to set the URI to send StatsCollector statistics to.\r\n\r\nExample: `graphite://graphite-hostaddress:port` or `influxdb://influxdb-hostaddress:port/dbname`. Note that the port is optional, if not added the default port for the respective collector (graphite or influxdb) will be used. Additionally, the database name `dbname` is also optional; default db name is `cloudstack`. Note that one must create and configure the database if using influxdb.\r\n\r\n- Host stats\r\nFor the host metrics it creates an InfluxDB point with the measure `host_stats` and containing the following tags and fields:\r\nTags:\r\n-- host_id\r\n-- uuid\r\n-- pod_id\r\n-- data_center_id\r\nFields:\r\n-- total_memory_kbs\r\n-- free_memory_kbs\r\n-- cpu_utilization\r\n-- cpus\r\n-- cpu_sockets\r\n-- network_read_kbs\r\n-- network_write_kbs\r\n\r\n- VM stats\r\nIt creates an InfluxDB point with the measure `vm_stats` and containing the following tags and fields:\r\nTags:\r\n-- vm_id\r\n-- uuid\r\n-- pod_id\r\n-- data_center_id\r\n-- host_id\r\nFields:\r\n-- total_memory_kbs\r\n-- free_memory_kbs\r\n-- memory_target_kbs\r\n-- cpu_utilization\r\n-- cpus\r\n-- network_read_kbs\r\n-- network_write_kbs\r\n-- disk_read_kbs\r\n-- disk_read_iops\r\n-- disk_write_kbs\r\n-- disk_write_iops\r\n\r\n**Note:** As the current stats collector supports only KVM, this extension supports only KVM. I am planning on enhance and refactor the StatsCollector architecture on the future. Due to the inner class structure, test case for some methods will not be implemented. On the future it will be necessary to refactor the whole StatsCOllector architecture and extract inner classes.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nWith IPv6 we are not using DHCP to allocate addresses, but using\r\nStateLess Address Auto Configuration (SLAAC) a Instance will calculate\r\nit's own address based on the Router Advertisements send out by the\r\nrouters in the network.\r\n\r\nThis Advertisement contains the IPv6 Subnet in use in that subnet and\r\nallows to calculate the stable Address the Instance will obtain based\r\non it's MAC Address.\r\n\r\nThe existing code is 'dead code' as it has been written, but was never\r\nused by any production code.\r\n\r\nSLAAC only works properly with subnets of exactly 64-bits large.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n\r\n## Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n![screenshot from 2018-12-03

Description\r\nIt was found out that direct download feature stops working after 'provisionCertificate' API is executed, as both features import certificates into the same `/etc/cloudstack/agent/cloud.jks` keystore.\r\nThe 'provisionCertificate' API invokes a script which regenerates the keystore before adding the new certificate, removing the existing certificates from the keystore. This fix prevents regenerating the keystore before adding the new certificates.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to

Description\r\nThis PR refactors the modifyvxlan.sh script for VXLAN support on KVM Hypervisors.\r\n\r\nHighlights:\r\n\r\n- Only use iproute2 commands for all links, bridges and routes\r\n- Use proper Bash syntax in script\r\n- Add IPv6 underlay support\r\n\r\nThe script does not change existing functionality, running KVM hypervisors will keep functioning as they are doing right now.\r\n\r\nThis script hasn't been touched in 5 years (last commit in 2013) and needed some attention.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple commits in this PR to see how I got to the current code.\r\n\r\n##

Description\r\nThere are some issues reported on the direct download feature for KVM:\r\n-  The API method 'uploadTemplateDirectDownloadCertificate' always returns 'success:true' despite the ceritificate has been properly uploaded or not\r\n- The certificate provided as parameter on 'uploadTemplateDirectDownloadCertificate' is not verified before being sent to hosts. This causes that hosts could not set up the certificates and fail the operation. \r\n\r\nTo tackle these issues, several improvements for the KVM direct download feature have been introduced:\r\n- Perform sanity check before sending certificate to hosts:\r\n   - Verify the provided certificate is valid (right format) and not expired\r\n- Report cases of failure when uploading certificates to hosts.\r\n   - Return 'success:false' if the certificate cannot be uploaded to the hosts and log the issue properly\r\n- Not issue-related improvements\r\n   - Move the KVM direct download logic to KVM code\r\n   - Add marvin tests\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nCurrently secondary ipv6 addresses are added to the ipv4 ipset in security_group.py.\r\nThis doesn't work, so this patch adds a function to split a set of ips in ipv4 and ipv6 addresses.\r\nBoth the `default_network_rules` and `network_rules_vmSecondaryIp` functions now utilise this function and add the ips to the appropriate ipsets.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes:

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nCurrently secondary ipv6 addresses are added to the ipv4 ipset in `security_group.py`.\r\nThis doesn't work, so this patch adds a function

actual testing, I could see that kvmheartbeat.sh script fails on NFS\r\nserver failure and stops the agent only. Any HA VMs could be launched\r\nin different hosts, and recovery of NFS server could lead to a state\r\nwhere a HA enabled VM runs on two hosts and can potentially cause\r\ndisk corruptions. In most cases, VM disk corruption will be worse than\r\nVM downtime. I've kept the sleep interval between check/rounds but\r\nreduced it to 10s.

Description\r\n\r\nFeature Specification: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=95653548\r\n\r\nLive storage migration on KVM under these conditions:\r\n- From source and destination hosts within the same cluster\r\n- From NFS primary storage to NFS cluster-wide primary storage\r\n- Source NFS and destination NFS storage mounted on hosts\r\n\r\nIn order to enable this functionality, database should be updated in order to enable live storage capacibilty for KVM, if previous conditions are met. This is due to existing conflicts between qemu and libvirt versions. This has been tested on CentOS 6 hosts.\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n\r\n1. To use this feature set the `storage_motion_supported=1` in the hypervisor_capability table for KVM. This is done by default as the feature may not work in some environments, read below.\r\n2. This feature of online storage+VM migration for KVM will only work with CentOS6 and possible Ubuntu as KVM hosts but not with CentOS7 due to:\r\n- https://bugs.centos.org/view.php?id=14026\r\n- https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1219541\r\nOn CentOS7 the error we see is: `\" error: unable to execute QEMU command 'migrate': this feature or command is not currently supported\"` (reference https://ask.openstack.org/en/question/94186/live-migration-unable-to-execute-qemu-command-migrate/). Reading through various lists looks like the migrate feature with qemu may be available with paid versions of RHEL-EV but not centos7 however this works with CentOS6.\r\n\r\nFix for CentOS 7:\r\n- Create repo file on /etc/yum.repos.d/:\r\n````\r\n[qemu-kvm-rhev]\r\nname=oVirt rebuilds of qemu-kvm-rhev\r\nbaseurl=http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-3.5/rpm/el7Server/\r\nmirrorlist=http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/mirrorlist-ovirt-3.5-el7Server\r\nenabled=1\r\nskip_if_unavailable=1\r\ngpgcheck=0\r\n````\r\n- `yum install qemu-kvm-common-ev-2.3.0-29.1.el7.x86_64 qemu-kvm-ev-2.3.0-29.1.el7.x86_64 qemu-img-ev-2.3.0-29.1.el7.x86_64`\r\n- Reboot host\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

qemu version:\r\n`org.libvirt.LibvirtException: internal error: unable to execute QEMU command 'migrate': this feature or command is not currently supported`\r\n\r\nFix for CentOS 7:\r\n- Create repo

adds a new API `updateVmwareDc` that allows admins to update the\r\nVMware datacenter details of a zone.

The update API assumes that there is only one vCenter per\r\nzone.

perfomance on creating VM for KVM virtualization.\r\n\r\nOn a huge hosts every \"ifconfig | grep\" takes a lot of time (about 2.5-3 minutes on hosts with 500 machines). For example: `ip link show dev $vlanDev > /dev/null` is faster than `ifconfig |grep -w $vlanDev > /dev/null`. But using `ip` command is much better. Using this patch you can create 500s machine in 10 seconds.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is for deactivating Ehcache in CloudStack since it is not usable. The first commit remove the default RMI cache peering configured for multicast which most of the time cannot work. It also requires to have an interface up which is not always the case while developing offline.\r\nThe second commits remove the configuration to activate caching on some DAOs.\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\nThe code in CS does not seem to fit any caching mechanism especially due to the homemade DAO code. The main 3 flaws are the following:\r\n\r\n#### Entities are not expected to be shared\r\nThere is quite a lot of code with method calls passing entity IDs value as `long`, which does some object fetching. Without caching, this behavior will create distinct objects each time an entity with the same ID is fetched. With the cache enabled, the same object will be shared among those methods. It has been seen that it does generate some side effects where code still expected unchanged entity attributes after calling different methods thus generating exception/bugs.\r\n\r\n#### DAO update operations are using search queries\r\nSome part of the code are updating entities based on a search query, therefore the whole cache must be invalidated (see GenericDaoBase: `public int update(UpdateBuilder ub, final SearchCriteria<?> sc, Integer rows);`).\r\n\r\n#### Entities based on views joining multiple tables\r\nThere are quite a lot of entities based on SQL views joining multiple entities in a same object. Enabling caching on those would require a mechanism to link and cross-remove related objects whenever one of the sub-entity is changed.\r\n\r\n### Final word\r\nBased on the previously discussed points, the best approach IMHO would be to move out of the custom DAO framework in CS and use a well known one (out of scope of this change of course). It will handle caching well and the joins made by the views in the code. It's not an easy change, but it will fix along a lot of issues and add a proven / robust framework to an important part of the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce? Put an `x` in all the boxes that apply: -->\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n## How Has This Been Tested?\r\nA cluster of management servers with a manual ehcache RMI configuration has been setup to test different changes in the caching. The RMI cache setup has been verified though cache invalidation being propagated to the other server. A series of integration tests have been run, while figuring out the reason for (random)

Description\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in detail -->\r\nUsers reported that they weren't getting all apis listed in cloudmonkey when running a `sync`. After some debugging, I found that the problem is that the `ApiDiscoveryService` is calling `ApiRateLimitServiceImpl.checkAccess()`, so the results of the listApis command are being truncated because Cloudstack believes the user has exceeded their API throttling rate.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nI enabled throttling with a 25 request per second limit. I then created a test role with only `list*` permissions and assigned it to a test user. When this user calls `listApis`, they will typically receive anywhere from 15-18 results. Checking the logs, you see `The given user has reached his/her account api limit, please retry after 218 ms.`. \r\n\r\nI raised the limit to 200 requests per second, restarted the management server and tried again. This time I got 143 results and no log messages about the user being throttled.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

tries to provide a threshold based fix for #2873 where swappinness of VR is not used until last resort. By limiting swappiness unless actually needed, the VR system degradation can be avoided for most cases. The other change is around not starting `baremetal-vr` by default on all VRs, according to the spec https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Baremetal+Advanced+Networking+Support only vmware VRs need to run it and that too only as the last step of the setup/completion, so we don't need to run it all the time.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?

Description\r\nWindows has support for several paravirt features that it will use when running on Hyper-V, Microsoft's hypervisor. These features are called enlightenments. Many of the features are similar to paravirt functionality that exists with Linux on KVM (virtio, kvmclock, PV EOI, etc.)\r\n\r\nNowadays QEMU/KVM can also enable support for several Hyper-V enlightenments. When enabled, Windows VMs running on KVM will use many of the same paravirt optimizations they would use when running on Hyper-V. \r\n\r\nA number of years ago, a PR was introduced that added a good portion of the code to enable this feature set, but it was never completed. This PR enables the existing features. The previous patch set detailed in https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/1013 also included the tests.\r\n\r\nBy selecting Windows PV, the enlightenment additions will be applied to the libvirt configuration. This is support on Windows Server 2008 and beyond, so all currently supported versions of Windows Server.\r\n\r\nIn our testing, we've seen benchmark improvements of around 20-25% running on Centos 7 hosts and it is also supported on Centos/RHEL 6.5 and later. Testing on Ubuntu would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n<!--- What types of changes does your code introduce?
