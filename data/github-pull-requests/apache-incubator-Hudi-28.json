Change Logs\r\n\r\nSupport SQL update for no-precombine field tables, improves user experience and makes it easier to start with Hudi, this is now (current master, 0.14) supported in MERGE INTO and upsert can also skip to \"combine\" records, if user does not want to define pcf field, let allow them to do sql updates out of the box, we do not expect duplicates here anyways.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nChanges behaviour of SQL Update command in spark, now users can update records in tables where no precombine field is specified. For MOR tables with no precombine fields throws an error since MOR requires precombine field.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNeed to update Spark quickstart, to note non-pcf sql updates are supported for CoW.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-24T22:35:30Z","updated_at":"2024-07-22T19:16:24Z","closed_at":"2024-07-22T19:16:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4edb82d0a431a2b93dfafbd7686f8d1b6713513a","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"danny0405","id":7644508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc2NDQ1MDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7644508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405","html_url":"https://github.com/danny0405","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/danny0405/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":3382222382,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM7JmJ4u","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/spark-sql","name":"spark-sql","color":"5BAEBC","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5121529038,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABMURUzg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/usability","name":"usability","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6615585053,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABilHRHQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/size:S","name":"size:S","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":"PR

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhem using custom key generator with timestamp field with type `EPOCHMILLISECONDS` and output date format as `yyyy/MM/dd`, partition parsing fails because partition column is thought to be of LongType even though it is string. \r\nAnother issue is that if there are multiple partition fields with cusotm keygen, then lazy listing fails due to parsing of partitions with non-encoded slashes. This PR fixes these issues. \r\n\r\nIt also adds a test to check partition pruning kicks in for TimestampBasedKeyGenerator.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes couple of bugs bug when using custom keygen with timestamp fields.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\nEager listing in case of custom keygen with multiple fields can be costlier but functional. Before this patch, it wasn't even functional.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIssue #9005 described a usecase where adding a new column into an existing hudi table was failing due to schema incompatibility exception. The exception was being thrown because the new column was marked as NOT NULL by default. This PR adds a config parameter 'MAKE_NEW_COLUMNS_NULLABLE' which when set to true will mark newly added column as nullable. By default 'MAKE_NEW_COLUMNS_NULLABLE' is set to false to maintain existing behavior.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSee description\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdding support for upsert and deletes with spark datasource for pk less table. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis patch opens up possibility to do updates or delete records with spark datasource writes for a primary key less table. \r\n\r\nFor eg, if for a primary table, user prefers to delete all records for a given employee. \r\n```\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(basePath).filter(\"emp_id == '100')\r\ndf.write.format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.datasource.write.operation\",\"delete\").mode(Append).save(basePath) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is feasible for a pk less table. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-21T19:28:52Z","updated_at":"2023-08-31T12:11:46Z","closed_at":"2023-08-06T03:22:46Z","merged_at":"2023-08-06T03:22:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"7061652e1bda92037ae796edae3d18fb6ec64529","assignee":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5187724363,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNTZkSw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.14.0","name":"release-0.14.0","color":"B9BAA3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/edd7d00172e57421cc50dcfcc2c90e4b909f67bd","head":{"label":"nsivabalan:enableUpsertsDeletesPkless","ref":"enableUpsertsDeletesPkless","sha":"edd7d00172e57421cc50dcfcc2c90e4b909f67bd","user":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159547623,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk1NDc2MjM=","name":"hudi","full_name":"nsivabalan/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.githu

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Adds a new AWS credentials provider `HoodieConfigAWSAssumedRoleCredentialsProvider` to assume an AWS role using the default provider chain\r\n- Adds the Hudi AWS provider chain to the Glue sync client, where currently it is used only in DynamoDB and CloudWatch, and for Glue we use the default one.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe user will be able to use the same configuration for Glue, DynamoDB and CloudWatch. And also assume a role using the default provider chain.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nI just updated the doc for  [Amazon Web Services Configs](https://hudi.apache.org/docs/configurations/#AWS).\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

We cannot yet use such checks since only recent version of parquet can verify the bloom exist\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

performing a clean in Hudi, the earliest commit to be retained is obtained by calling the getEarliestCommitToRetain method in CleanPlanner. However, if a pending commit takes a long time and becomes the earliest active timeline, calling getEarliestCommitToRetain will return empty because there is no earlier commit than the pending commit. This can cause a problem during an incremental clean, as the previous endpoint (i.e., the last commit retained in the previous clean) is used as the starting point. If this starting point is empty, a full clean will be triggered, which is very resource-intensive.\r\nTo solve this problem without affecting normal clean, we set the EarliestCommitToRetain obtained in this situation to the earliest pending commit. Since the endpoint will not be cleaned in the current clean, this approach can solve the aforementioned problem without affecting normal clean operations.\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nModify the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the write failure for Avro Enum type.  The write failure due to Avro Enum type is a regression since with Hudi 0.12.3 release writing data with Enum type works.\r\n\r\nThe regression is confirmed by running the test `TestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage#testSmallInsertHandlingForInserts` after adding the Enum type in the test schema without applying the fix:\r\n```\r\nmvn -DwildcardSuites=\"abc\" -Dtest=TestHoodieClientOnCopyOnWriteStorage#testSmallInsertHandlingForInserts -DfailIfNoTests=false clean test -Dspark3.3 -Dscala-2.12 -Dflink1.14 -pl hudi-client/hudi-spark-client -am\r\n```\r\nFor 0.12.3 release, the test succeeds.  For 0.13.0 release and master, the test fails.  Note that in both cases the test actually takes a schema with a field of Enum type.\r\n\r\nWhen the input records have an Enum field in the Avro schema, the write fails due to before this fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\n29542 [Executor task launch worker for task 2.0 in stage 35.0 (TID 56)] ERROR org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle [] - Error writing record HoodieRecord{key=HoodieKey { recordKey=09959033-0742-4638-aca4-44162efa4b27 partitionPath=2015/03/17}, currentLocation='null', newLocation='null'}\r\norg.apache.avro.AvroRuntimeException: Unknown schema type: ENUM\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.avro.HoodieAvroUtils.rewritePrimaryType(HoodieAvroUtils.java:948) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.avro.HoodieAvroUtils.rewriteRecordWithNewSchemaInternal(HoodieAvroUtils.java:895) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.avro.HoodieAvroUtils.rewriteRecordWithNewSchema(HoodieAvroUtils.java:830) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.avro.HoodieAvroUtils.rewriteRecordWithNewSchemaInternal(HoodieAvroUtils.java:851) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.avro.HoodieAvroUtils.rewriteRecordWithNewSchema(HoodieAvroUtils.java:830) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.avro.HoodieAvroUtils.rewriteRecordWithNewSchema(HoodieAvroUtils.java:800) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.avro.HoodieAvroUtils.rewriteRecordWithNewSchema(HoodieAvroUtils.java:784) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.common.model.HoodieAvroRecord.prependMetaFields(HoodieAvroRecord.java:132) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieCreateHandle.doWrite(HoodieCreateHandle.java:144) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.io.HoodieWriteHandle.write(HoodieWriteHandle.java:182) ~[classes/:?]\r\n    at org.apache.hudi.execution.CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.consume(CopyOnWriteInsertHandler.java:98) ~[classes/:?]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix adds logic to handle `ENUM` type in `HoodieAvroUtils.rewriteRecordWithNewSchemaInternal` and `AvroDeserializer`. A new enum field is added to the trip schema in `HoodieTestDataGenerator` for covering the Enum type in all relevant tests.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes the core write functionality for Avro enum type.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\n- Improve `ConflictResolutionStrategy` interface\r\n- Enable `SimpleConcurrentFileWritesConflictResolutionStrategy` to automatically identify write priority or bucket index, and optimize the logic of `getCandidateInstants`\r\n- Add `StateTransitionTimeBasedConflictResolutionStrategy`, which is based on StateTransition and does not need to get pending instants\r\n- Remove `lastCompletedTxnOwnerInstant` in `TransactionManager` (only used for conflict detection, under the new logic, it has no effect)\r\n- Full tests\r\n\r\nTo know more, can read

Speedup column stats and bloom index creation on large datasets.\n\n### Change Logs\n\nWhen creating records for the column stats and bloom filter partitions:\n1. Create list of tuples of (partitionName, fileName, isDeleted)\n2. Parallelize the above list so all files are handled in parallel\n\nAnother benefit of the above approach is that creation of deletion and append records and handled in the same code which reduces code duplication. \n\n\n### Impact\n\nIn a test on large dataset (5K partition, 1.3Million files) the index initialization time was reduced as follows:\nColumn Stats Index: \n  Before change: 21mins\n  After change: ~5mins\n\nBloom Filter Index:\n  Before change: 25mins\n  After change: ~10mins\n\n\n\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\n\nNone\n\n### Documentation Update\n\nNone\n\n### Contributor's checklist\n\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\n- [ ] CI passed\n","created_at":"2023-07-18T11:45:45Z","updated_at":"2023-08-15T07:00:01Z","closed_at":"2023-08-11T16:37:20Z","merged_at":"2023-08-11T16:37:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"05ac011316564f97de178b023e8e93ff768c37a4","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2610270804,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjEwMjcwODA0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:blocker","name":"priority:blocker","color":"78FA72","default":false,"description":""},{"id":5187724363,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBI7nWM8AAAABNTZkSw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/release-0.14.0","name":"release-0.14.0","color":"B9BAA3","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9223/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/9223/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/9223/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/482f63ffe2df3fbaf0176a175b530082e0f31154","head":{"label":"prashantwason:pw_speedup_index_creation","ref":"pw_speedup_index_creation","sha":"482f63ffe2df3fbaf0176a175b530082e0f31154","user":{"login":"prashantwason","id":58448203,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NDQ4MjAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/58448203?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason","html_url":"https://github.com/prashantwason","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/prashantwason/events{/privacy}","received_event

Change Logs\r\n- Create new HiveConf object every time when initializing `HiveSyncConfig` and add hadoopConf as resource\r\nWe have to load Hadoop conf otherwise properties like `--conf

This issue was introduced another PR to address the OOM issue changed it: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8050\r\n\r\nTo address the OOM problem we can create a new HiveConf every time instead of casting hadoop conf to hive conf.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAvoid using `FileSystem#getSchema()` to get schema from path, support presto read parquet format log file.\r\n\r\nWhen reading parquet format log file with presto will throw error : \r\n```log\r\nCaused by: io.prestosql.jdbc.$internal.client.FailureInfo$FailureException: Not implemented by the FileSystemWrapper FileSystem implementation\r\n```\r\nBecause presto implemented `FileSystem` doesn't override method `getSchema()`, so calling `FileSystem#getSchema()` in presto will throw error.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe failed writes clean policy should be lazy when write concurrency mode is optimistic concurrency control. `FlinkOptions` should support to config failed writes clean policy. The parameters of `FlinkStreamerConfig`, `FlinkCompactionConfig` and `FlinkClusteringConfig` should also support failed writes clean policy parameter. Meanwhile, append mode without inline clustering should add clean operator in pipeline to rollback failed writes.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n`FlinkOptions`, `FlinkStreamerConfig`, `FlinkCompactionConfig` and `FlinkClusteringConfig` supports to config failed writes clean policy.

need to recommit ( thus the last instant heartbeat will remain) \r\n\r\nThis PR fixed this by stop heerbeat for current instant before start a new instant. \r\n\r\nThis PR also improve `TestStreamWriteOperatorCoordinator#testRecommitWithLazyFailedWritesCleanPolicy` to make it closer to real occasions. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nstop current instant heartbeat before start new instant\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNONE\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through
