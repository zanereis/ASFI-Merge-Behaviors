So with this wrong usage, the priority is always very low, and hard(maybe never?) to reach over 50. Then the queue is full with a very low priority, not consuming anymore.\r\n\r\nThe fix is easy, make the priority back to expected value.","created_at":"2022-04-21T12:44:59Z","updated_at":"2022-04-21T15:31:25Z","closed_at":"2022-04-21T15:30:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b413ed8650b750457e27b4a113cc86549e0cf4aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kezhenxu94","id":15965696,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTY1Njk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15965696?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94","html_url":"https://github.com/kezhenxu94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kezhenxu94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":283421094,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyODM0MjEwOTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"fc2929","default":true,"description":"Something
