Added support for Containers\r\n* Added support for generic lists of fixed/variable size type\r\n* Added support for generic fixed size type vectors\r\n\r\nI had to add some handling of scopes (SSZReader.slice()) and also some type hierarchy. Let me try to justify why\r\n\r\n* The size of the list of variable size type is easy to calculate from the first offset, because the fixed part of encoding only contains offsets.\r\n\r\n* The size of a vector is known at the time of designing the data structure.\r\n\r\n* But the size of the list when reading a list of fixed size type is not encoded. To find out what the size is, one must carefully maintain the scopes and then divide the corresponding scope of the list by the size of one element (size of one element is known at the time of defining the data structure).\r\n\r\n* Moreover The length of a scope for a list is unknown until we read the offset of the next variable element in the parent container or the reminder of the fixed part.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Jiri Peinlich <jiri.peinlich@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for sending a pull request!

This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect\">github connect</a> or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.7</h2>\n<p>Support 10GB cache upload using the latest version <code>1.0.8</code> of <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache\"><code>@actions/cache</code> </a></p>\n<h2>v2.1.6</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Catch unhandled &quot;bad file descriptor&quot; errors that sometimes occurs when the cache server returns non-successful response (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/pull/596\">actions/cache#596</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix permissions error seen when extracting caches with GNU tar that were previously created using BSD tar (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/527\">actions/cache#527</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Make caching more verbose <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/650\">#650</a></li>\n<li>Use GNU tar on macOS if available <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/toolkit/pull/701\">#701</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.3</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Upgrades <code>@actions/core</code> to v1.2.6 for <a href=\"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfwh-5m23-j46w\">CVE-2020-15228</a>. This action was not using the affected methods.</li>\n<li>Fix error handling in <code>uploadChunk</code> where 400-level errors were not being detected and handled correctly</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Adds input to limit the chunk upload size, useful for self-hosted runners with slower upload speeds</li>\n<li>No-op when executing on GHES</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update <code>@actions/cache</code> package to <code>v1.0.2</code> which allows cache action to use posix format when taring files.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Replaces the <code>http-client</code> with the Azure Storage SDK for NodeJS when downloading cache content from Azure.  This should help improve download performance and reliability as the SDK downloads files in 4 MB chunks, which can be parallelized and retried independently</li>\n<li>Display download progress and speed</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.0.0</h2>\n<p>Initial v2 release</p>\n<h2>What's new in v2</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support for multiple paths (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/16\">actions/cache#16</a>), glob patterns, and single file caches (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/33\">actions/cache#33</a>)</li>\n<li>Increased performance and improved cache sizes using <code>zstd</code> for compression for Linux and macOS runners (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/184\">actions/cache#184</a>)</li>\n<li>Allowed caching for all events with a ref (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/63\">actions/cache#63</a>)</li>\n<li>Created the <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/cache\"><code>@actions/cache</code></a> npm package to allow other actions to utilize caching (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/55\">actions/cache#55</a>)</li>\n<li>Added a best-effort step to delete the archive after extraction to reduces storage space (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/pull/209\">actions/cache#209</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v1.2.0</h2>\n<h1>Bug Fixes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fall back to GNU tar on older versions of Windows that do not have BSD tar installed (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/252\">#252</a>)</li>\n<li>Fixed chunk upload retry logic (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/actions/cache/issues/305\">#305</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
