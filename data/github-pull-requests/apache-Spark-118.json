for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38022 introduces an optional feature for supporting double-quoted identifiers. The feature is controlled by a flag `spark.sql.ansi.double_quoted_identifiers` which is independent from the flag `spark.sql.ansi.enabled`.\r\nThis is inconsistent with another ANSI SQL feature \"Enforce ANSI reserved keywords\": https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-ansi-compliance.html#sql-keywords-optional-disabled-by-default, which is only available when `spark.sql.ansi.enabled` is true.\r\n\r\nThus, to make the ANSI flags consistent, I suggest making double-quoted identifiers only available under ANSI SQL mode.\r\nOther than that, this PR renames it from `spark.sql.ansi.double_quoted_identifiers` to `spark.sql.ansi.doubleQuotedIdentifiers`\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo make the ANSI SQL related features consistent.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the feature is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew SQL test input file under ANSI

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR supports data masking built-in Function **mask**, which returns a masked version of input string. \r\nBy default, upper case letters will be converted to \"X\", lower case letters will be converted to \"x\" and numbers will be converted to \"n\".\r\n\r\nFor example mask(\"**abcd-EFGH-8765-4321**\") results in **xxxx-XXXX-nnnn-nnnn** will be able to override the characters used in the mask by supplying additional arguments: the second argument controls the mask character for upper case letters, the third argument for lower case letters and the fourth argument for numbers. For example, mask(\"**abcd-EFGH-8765-4321\", \"U\", \"l\", \"#**\") should result in **llll-UUUU-####-####**\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```\r\n > SELECT mask('abcd-EFGH-8765-4321');\r\n   xxxx-XXXX-nnnn-nnnn\r\n > SELECT mask('abcd-EFGH-8765-4321', 'Q');\r\n   xxxx-QQQQ-nnnn-nnnn\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#', 'Q','q');\r\n   QqQQnnn-@$#\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#');\r\n   XxXXnnn-@$#\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#', 'Q');\r\n   QxQQnnn-@$#\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#', 'Q','q');\r\n   QqQQnnn-@$#\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#', 'Q','q', 'd');\r\n   QqQQddd-@$#\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#', 'Q','q', 'd', 'o');\r\n   QqQQdddoooo\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#', -1, 'q', 'd', 'o');\r\n   AqCDdddoooo\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#', -1,-1, 'd', 'o');\r\n   AbCDdddoooo\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#', -1,-1, -1, 'o');\r\n   AbCD123oooo\r\n > SELECT mask(NULL, -1,-1, -1, 'o');\r\n   NULL\r\n > SELECT mask(NULL);\r\n   NULL\r\n > SELECT mask('AbCD123-@$#', -1, -1, -1, -1);\r\n   AbCD123-@$#\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo support data masking built-in function **mask**, which returns a masked version of the input string\r\nRef : [Data masking functions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/hive/languagemanual+udf#LanguageManualUDF-DataMaskingFunctions)\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd permission to recover label job\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI notice that some apache projects [added the `permissons` explictly](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/.github/workflows/label_prs.yml#L26-L28), it doesn't be impacted by github action flaky.\r\n\r\nIn princinple, the default github action token permissons already [contains enough permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token), but looks like it failed due to some reason recently (but I didn't notice any github official changes log yet and apache infra notification)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, dev only\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nFrankly, we couldn't test it before merge because it not happened in fork repo, and also `pull_request_target` is only work after this merge.\r\n\r\nBut local test can help us to make sure it works in some level: https://github.com/Yikun/spark/pull/176\r\n\r\n<img width=\"847\" alt=\"image\"

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR supports correlated non-equality predicates in subqueries. It leverages the DecorrelateInnerQuery framework to decorrelate subqueries with non-equality predicates. DecorrelateInnerQuery inserts domain joins in the query plan and the rule RewriteCorrelatedScalarSubquery rewrites the domain joins into actual joins with the outer query.\r\n\r\nNote, correlated non-equality predicates can lead to query plans with non-equality join conditions, which may be planned as a broadcast NL join or cartesian product.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo improve subquery support in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. Before this PR, Spark does not allow correlated non-equality predicates in subqueries. \r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT (SELECT min(c2) FROM t2 WHERE t1.c1 > t2.c1) FROM t1\r\n```\r\nThis will throw an exception: `Correlated column is not allowed in a non-equality predicate`\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, this query can run successfully.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests and SQL query tests.","created_at":"2022-10-06T18:20:12Z","updated_at":"2022-10-24T03:10:53Z","closed_at":"2022-10-24T03:10:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"62d248a77233e27d8967ac72de0d2a3229cb341c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a3e94a42b4886fe61ec0e38f34f148f9718f4219","head":{"label":"allisonwang-db:spark-36114-non-equality-pred","ref":"spark-36114-non-equality-pred","sha":"a3e94a42b4886fe61ec0e38f34f148f9718f4219","user":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":271915022,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzE5MTUwMjI=","name":"spark","full_name":"allisonwang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"allisonwang-db","id":66282705,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MjgyNzA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66282705?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/allisonwang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/allisonwang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to modify Hive catalog implementation of create partition in the case when Hive reports that some of partitions exist already. In that case, Spark will check existence of all input partitions one-by-one and return **only existing** partitions in `PartitionAlreadyExistsException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To do not confuse Spark SQL users about existing partitions.\r\n2. To be consistent with other catalogs V2 and V1 In-Memory.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it changes user-facing error message.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE t (id bigint, data string) USING HIVE PARTITIONED BY (id);\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION (id=2) LOCATION 'loc1';\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION (id=1) LOCATION 'loc' PARTITION (id=2) LOCATION 'loc1';\r\nThe following partitions already exists in table 't' database 'default':\r\nMap(id -> 1)\r\n===\r\nMap(id -> 2)\r\n```\r\nThe error shows an existent and a non-existent partitions.\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION (id=1) LOCATION 'loc' PARTITION (id=2) LOCATION 'loc1';\r\nThe following partitions already exists in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the following dependencies shaded:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncom.google.android:annotations\r\ncom.google.api.grpc:proto-google-common-proto\r\nio.perfmark:perfmark-api\r\norg.codehaus.mojo:animal-sniffer-annotations\r\ncom.google.errorprone:error_prone_annotations\r\ncom.google.j2objc:j2objc-annotations\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38109, it worked because related dependences pulled together but now we don't as Spark Connect would be a single jar. This issue has existed from the very first place.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the tests fails if you build Spark Connect with Maven. SBT does not have the issue because it does the assemply with all dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the codes are not released out yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via Maven:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./build/mvn clean package\r\n./python/run-tests --testnames

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n1. On the SQL side:\r\n- Make AQE explicitly invoke `stage.cleanupResources()` at driver after each stage finished. Existing AQE's `cleanupResources` has following limitations:\r\n-- method `cleanupResources` is only implemented in `SortExec`, and it is only called in `SortMergeJoinExec`; so a physical operator's `cleanupResources` can be called iff it is a descendant of `SortMergeJoinExec`;\r\n-- the above invocations in `SortMergeJoinScanner` happens in the executors side, so a physical operator's `cleanupResources` will never be invoked at driver;\r\n- Invoke `plan.cleanupResources()` in `QueryStageExec`, since itself is a leaf;\r\n2. On the Pandas-API-on-Spark side:\r\n- apply `persist` instead of `localCheckpoint `\r\n- add a new config `compute. default_index_cache` to control the storage level of temporary RDDs;\r\n- unpersist the cached RDD in `cleanupResources` in `AttachDistributedSequenceExec`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`distributed_sequence` is the default indexing in Pandas-API-on-Spark, it will `localCheckpoint` (also cache internally) a temporary RDD to avoid re-computation. For large-scale dataset, it is prone to fail due to unreliable checkpointing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.spark.SparkException:  Checkpoint block rdd_448_38 not found! Either the executor that originally checkpointed this partition is no longer alive, or the original RDD is unpersisted. If this problem persists, you may consider using `rdd.checkpoint()` instead, which is slower than local checkpointing but more fault-tolerant.        \r\n    at org.apache.spark.errors.SparkCoreErrors$.checkpointRDDBlockIdNotFoundError(SparkCoreErrors.scala:82)\r\n    at \r\n```\r\n\r\nwe should use `persist` instead, and clean the cached RDDs ASAP.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nyes, new config `compute. default_index_cache `\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nadded UT\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-06T12:25:28Z","updated_at":"2022-10-17T16:06:43Z","closed_at":"2022-10-17T11:23:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0d5aada62bd4c531622346e1d903362233416eb8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug which occurs NPE when the input schema of applyInPandasWithState has \"non-nullable\" column(s).\r\nThis PR also leaves a code comment explaining the fix. Quoting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // See processTimedOutState: we create a row which contains the actual values for grouping key,\r\n  // but all nulls for value side by intention. This technically changes the schema of input to\r\n  // be \"nullable\", hence the schema information and the internal projection of row should take\r\n  // this into consideration. Strictly saying, it's not applied to the part of grouping key, but\r\n  // it doesn't hurt much even if we apply the same for grouping key as well.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere's a bug which we didn't take the non-null columns into account. This PR fixes the bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT. The new test case failed with NPE without the fix, and succeeded with the fix.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-06T00:00:07Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T06:18:12Z","closed_at":"2022-10-06T06:18:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fad07746d0f764473342c934ed45eca567431830","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCode refactor on all File data source options:\r\n- `TextOptions`\r\n- `CSVOptions`\r\n- `JSONOptions`\r\n- `AvroOptions`\r\n- `ParquetOptions`\r\n- `OrcOptions`\r\n- `FileIndex` related options\r\n\r\nChange semantics:\r\n- First, we introduce a new trait `DataSourceOptions`, which defines the following functions:\r\n  - `newOption(name)`: Register a new option\r\n  - `newOption(name, alternative)`: Register a new option with alternative\r\n  - `getAllValidOptions`: retrieve all valid options\r\n  - `isValidOption(name)`: validate a given option name\r\n  - `getAlternativeOption(name)`: get alternative option name if any\r\n- Then, for each class above\r\n  - Create/update its companion object to extend from the trait above and register all valid options within it.\r\n  - Update places where name strings are used directly to fetch option values to use those option constants instead.\r\n  - Add a unit test for each file data source options\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently for each file data source, all options are placed sparsely in the options class and there is no clear list of all options supported. As more and more options are added, the readability get worse. Thus, we want to refactor those codes so that\r\n- we can easily get a list of supported options for each data source\r\n- enforce better practice for adding new options going forwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `Random(hashing.byteswap32(index))` with `XORShiftRandom(index)` to distribute elements evenly across output partitions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt seems that the distribution using `XORShiftRandom` is better. For example:\r\n\r\n1. The number of output files has changed since SPARK-40407. [Some downstream projects](https://github.com/apache/iceberg/blob/c07f2aabc0a1d02f068ecf1514d2479c0fbdd3b0/spark/v3.3/spark-extensions/src/test/java/org/apache/iceberg/spark/extensions/TestRewriteDataFilesProcedure.java#L578-L579) use repartition to determine the number of output files in the test.\r\n   ```\r\n   bin/spark-shell --master \"local[2]\"\r\n   spark.range(10).repartition(10).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(\"/tmp/spark/repartition\")\r\n   ```\r\n   Before this PR and after SPARK-40407, the number of output files is 8. After this PR or before  SPARK-40407, the number of output files is 10.\r\n\r\n2. The distribution using `XORShiftRandom` seem better.\r\n   ```scala\r\n   import java.util.Random\r\n   import org.apache.spark.util.random.XORShiftRandom\r\n   import scala.util.hashing\r\n   \r\n   def distribution(count: Int, partition: Int) = {\r\n     println((1 to count).map(partitionId => new Random(partitionId).nextInt(partition))\r\n       .groupBy(f => f)\r\n       .map(_._2.size).mkString(\". \"))\r\n   \r\n     println((1 to count).map(partitionId => new Random(hashing.byteswap32(partitionId)).nextInt(partition))\r\n       .groupBy(f => f)\r\n       .map(_._2.size).mkString(\". \"))\r\n   \r\n     println((1 to count).map(partitionId => new XORShiftRandom(partitionId).nextInt(partition))\r\n       .groupBy(f => f)\r\n       .map(_._2.size).mkString(\". \"))\r\n   }\r\n   \r\n   distribution(200, 4)\r\n   ```\r\n   The output:\r\n   ```\r\n   200\r\n   50. 60. 46. 44\r\n   55. 48. 43. 54\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.","created_at":"2022-10-05T02:52:12Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T08:37:21Z","closed_at":"2022-10-05T06:01:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1fac67930cc346161ae6089dcd34ac08a2b64f49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38106/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38106/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38106/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d2952b671a3579759ad9ce326ed8389f5270fd9f","head":{"label":"wangyum:SPARK-40660","ref":"SPARK-40660","sha":"d2952b671a3579759ad9ce326ed8389f5270fd9f","user":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":467759455,"node_id":"R_kgDOG-FxXw","name":"spark","full_name":"wangyum/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangyum","id":5399861,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzOTk4NjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5399861?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum","html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangyum/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangyum/spark","description":"Apache

href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases\">protobuf-java's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Protobuf Release v3.16.3</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Refactoring java full runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.1</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve performance characteristics of UnknownFieldSet parsing (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9371\">#9371</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.0</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix compiler warnings issue found in conformance_test_runner <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8189\">#8189</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8190\">#8190</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix MinGW-w64 build issues.

runtime to reuse sub-message builders and prepare to\nmigrate parsing logic from parse constructor to builder.</li>\n<li>Move proto wireformat parsing functionality from the private &quot;parsing\nconstructor&quot; to the Builder class.</li>\n<li>Change the Lite runtime to prefer merging from the wireformat into mutable\nmessages rather than building up a new immutable object before merging. This\nway results in fewer allocations and copy operations.</li>\n<li>Make message-type extensions merge from wire-format instead of building up\ninstances and merging afterwards. This has much better performance.</li>\n<li>Fix TextFormat parser to build up recurring (but supposedly not repeated)\nsub-messages directly from text rather than building a new sub-message and\nmerging the fully formed message into the existing field.</li>\n<li>This release addresses a <a href=\"https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/security/advisories/GHSA-h4h5-3hr4-j3g2\">Security Advisory for Java users</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.1</h2>\n<h1>Java</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve performance characteristics of UnknownFieldSet parsing (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/9371\">#9371</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Protocol Buffers v3.16.0</h2>\n<h1>C++</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix compiler warnings issue found in conformance_test_runner <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8189\">#8189</a> (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/8190\">#8190</a>)</li>\n<li>Fix MinGW-w64 build issues.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd MASK_PHONE and TRY_MASK_PHONE functions to redact phone number string values.\r\n\r\nEach of these functions converts a string 'input' representing a phone number to an updated version applying a transformation to the characters. This can be useful for creating copies of tables with sensitive information removed, but retaining the same schema.\r\n\r\nBoth functions return an error if the format string is invalid.\r\n\r\nMASK_PHONE returns an error if the input string does not match the format string.\r\n\r\nTRY_MASK_PHONE instead returns NULL in that case.\r\n\r\nThe format can consist of the following characters, case insensitive:\r\n  - Each 'X' represents a digit which will be converted to 'X' in the result.\r\n  - Each digit '0'-'9' represents a digit which will be left unchanged in the result.\r\n  - Whitespace in the input string is left unchanged.\r\n  - Whitespace in the format string is ignored.\r\n  - Each '-' or '+' or '(' or ')' character should match exactly in the input string.\r\n  - The default format string is: (XXX) XXX-XXXX.\r\n\r\nNo other format characters are allowed.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```\r\n> SELECT MASK_PHONE(num) FROM VALUES (\"(555) 867-5309\") AS tab(num);\r\n  (XXX) XXX-XXXX\r\n> SELECT MASK_PHONE(\"  555 867 5309\", \"  XXX XXX XXXX\");\r\n    XXX XXX XXXX\r\n> SELECT MASK_PHONE(\"  +1 555 867 5309\", \"  +1 XXX XXX XXXX\");\r\n    +1 XXX XXX XXXX\r\n> SELECT MASK_PHONE(\"[555 867 5309]\", \"[XXX XXX XXXX]\");\r\n  Error: the format string is invalid\r\n> SELECT TRY_MASK_PHONE(\"+15558675309\");\r\n  NULL\r\n> SELECT TRY_MASK_PHONE(\"+1 555 867 5309\", \"+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX\");\r\n  NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds `MASK_DIGITS` as an alias for `MASK_CCN` since it is possible to specify any format string for custom digit masking use cases, e.g. social security numbers.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese functions are useful for processing string values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds new SQL functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nWe consider that Driver should wait for all related running tasks being killed, then it's time to kill the job. To do this, we make following change:\r\n1. add new api `runningTaskIdsByStageId()` and `isRunning()` for `TaskScheduler`\r\n2. add the wait logic between notifying taskKilled and jobFailed\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe basic motivation is that current logic without waiting for tasks killing will cause some side effects like remaining temporary directory, the details can be seen in [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-40647).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd an Unit Test.\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-04T07:45:24Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T00:19:52Z","closed_at":"2023-01-17T00:19:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b9afb02ae0893e5e0e5b95f071f90cd07bdecce","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38092/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38092/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38092/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d17fdad68207c6774b38b7a9c5043c3ca3191ea9","head":{"label":"wecharyu:SPARK-40647","ref":"SPARK-40647","sha":"d17fdad68207c6774b38b7a9c5043c3ca3191ea9","user":{"login":"wecharyu","id":65108011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTA4MDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65108011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu","html_url":"https://github.com/wecharyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":545264991,"node_id":"R_kgDOIIAVXw","name":"spark","full_name":"wecharyu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wecharyu","id":65108011,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1MTA4MDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65108011?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu","html_url":"https://github.com/wecharyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wecharyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wecharyu/spark","description":"Apache

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up for [SPARK-33134](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-33134) (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30031). \r\n\r\nI found another case when, depending on the order of columns, parsing one JSON field breaks all of the subsequent fields resulting in all nulls:\r\n\r\nWith a file like this:\r\n```\r\n{\"a\": {\"x\": 1, \"y\": true}, \"b\": {\"x\": 1}}\r\n{\"a\": {\"x\": 2}, \"b\": {\"x\": 2}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nReading the file results in column `b` as null even though it is a valid column.\r\n```scala\r\nval df = spark.read\r\n  .schema(\"a struct<x: int, y: struct<x: int>>, b struct<x: int>\")\r\n  .json(\"path\") \r\n\r\n===\r\n\r\na\t                b\r\nnull\t                null\r\n{\"x\":2,\"y\":null}\t{\"x\":2} \r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, b column should be:\r\n```\r\n{\"x\": 1}\r\n{\"x\": 2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis particular example actually used to work in earlier Spark versions but it was affected by SPARK-33134 which fixed another bug with the incorrect parsing in `from_json`. Because this case was not tested, we missed it at the time. \r\n\r\nIn order to fix both SPARK-33134 and SPARK-40646, we need to process `PartialResultException` in `convertArray` method to handle any errors in child objects. Without the fix, the code would not wrap the row in the array for `from_json` resulting in a ClassCastException (SPARK-33134). Because of this handling, we don't need `isRoot` check anymore in `convertObject` thus unblocking SPARK-40646.\r\n\r\nI updated the code to handle both cases. With these changes, we can correctly parse this case:\r\n```scala\r\nval df3 = Seq(\"\"\"[{\"c2\": [19], \"c1\": 123456}]\"\"\").toDF(\"c0\")\r\ncheckAnswer(df3.select(from_json($\"c0\", ArrayType(st))), Row(Array(Row(123456, null))))\r\n```\r\nwhich was previously returning `null` for the root row.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFixes a long-standing issue when parsing a JSON with an incorrect field that would break parsing of the entire record.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI added unit tests for SPARK-40646 as well as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe options passed from spark conf, hive-site.xml, AWS env vars now all record this in their source attribute of the entries.\r\n\r\nThe Configuration Writable methods do not propagate this, so it is not as useful cluster-wide than it could be. It does help with some of the basic troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n \r\nHelps when troubleshooting where options make their way down. These can be examined\r\nand logged later.\r\n\r\nFor example, my cloudstore diagnosticss JAR can do this in its storediag command\r\nand in an s3a AWS credential provider. I may add some of that logging\r\nat debug to the ASF hadoop implementations.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/steveloughran/cloudstore\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot *really*. It's a very low level diagnostics feature in the Hadoop configuration classes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew tests added; existing tests

`onTaskStart()` calls as `onTaskCompletion()` for the same `stageId` & `stageAttemptId` pair is correct. But there is race condition between `getExecutorUpdates()` and `onTaskStart()`.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we have two different threads:\r\n- task runner: to execute the task and informs `ExecutorMetricsPoller` about task starts and completion\r\n- heartbeater: which uses the `ExecutorMetricsPoller` to get the metrics\r\n\r\nTo show the race condition assume a task just finished which was running on its own (no other tasks was running). So this will decrease the `count` from 1 to 0.\r\n\r\nOn the task runner thread let say a new task starts. So the execution is in the `onTaskStart()` method let's assume the `countAndPeaks` is already computed and here the counter is 0 but the execution is still before incrementing the counter. So we are in between the following two lines:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n val countAndPeaks = stageTCMP.computeIfAbsent((stageId, stageAttemptId),\r\n      _ => TCMP(new AtomicLong(0), new AtomicLongArray(ExecutorMetricType.numMetrics)))\r\n val stageCount = countAndPeaks.count.incrementAndGet()\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's look at the other thread (heartbeater) where the `getExecutorUpdates()` is running and it is at the `removeIfInactive()` method:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n   def removeIfInactive(k: StageKey, v: TCMP): TCMP = {\r\n      if (v.count.get == 0) {\r\n        logDebug(s\"removing (${k._1}, ${k._2}) from stageTCMP\")\r\n        null\r\n      } else {\r\n        v\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here this entry is removed from `stageTCMP` as the count is 0.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the task runner thread where we increase the counter to 1 but that value will be lost as we have no entry in the `stageTCMP` for this stage and attempt.\r\n\r\nSo if a new task comes instead of 2 we will have 1 in the `stageTCMP` and when those two tasks finishes the second one will decrease the counter from 0 to -1. This is when the assert raised.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\nI managed to reproduce the issue with a temporary test:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n test(\"reproduce assert failure\") {\r\n    val testMemoryManager = new TestMemoryManager(new SparkConf())\r\n    val taskId = new AtomicLong(0)\r\n    val

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSimilar to [`PullOutGroupingExpressions`](https://github.com/wangyum/spark/blob/7fd3f8f9ec55b364525407213ba1c631705686c5/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/PullOutGroupingExpressions.scala#L48). This PR adds a new rule(`PullOutComplexJoinCondition`) to pull out complex join condition. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPull out complex join condition has following advantage:\r\n1. Reduce the number of complex expression evaluations from 3 to 2 times if it is SortMergeJoin..\r\n2. Infer more additional filters, sometimes can avoid data skew. For example: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/28642\r\n3. Avoid other rules also need to handle complex condition. For example: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/dee7396204e2f6e7346e220867953fc74cd4253d/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/optimizer/PushPartialAggregationThroughJoin.scala#L325-L327\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1 (item_id BIGINT, event_type STRING, dt STRING) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (dt);\r\nCREATE TABLE t2 (item_id BIGINT, cal_dt DATE) using parquet;\r\nset spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1;\r\n\r\nSELECT a.item_id,\r\n       a.event_type\r\nFROM   t1 a\r\n       INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT cal_dt,\r\n                                   item_id\r\n                   FROM   t2) b\r\n               ON a.item_id = b.item_id\r\n                  AND To_date(a.dt, 'yyyyMMdd') = b.cal_dt\r\nWHERE To_date(a.dt, 'yyyyMMdd') = date '2022-10-01';\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR:\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- Project [item_id#28L, event_type#29]\r\n   +- SortMergeJoin

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a change to the documentation of the argument `mangle_dup_cols` in the `read_excel` pandas api. It adds a note mentioning that the argument is case insensitive when reading in column names. One can remedy this by modifying the spark config.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt adds clarity to the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. The documentation currently does not mention that `mangle_dupe_cols` is case insensitive, nor does it mention a quick fix. This modification changes that.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNo tests were added. I attempted to build the python docs locally but could not on my m1 mac. To clarify, I tried building the docs before this modification and it did not work. I have the same issue with building static sites.","created_at":"2022-10-01T17:15:25Z","updated_at":"2023-02-10T00:21:10Z","closed_at":"2023-02-10T00:21:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f21bb8029ec0d619f2935880c2f0833ad58c83a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd MASK_CCN and TRY_MASK_CCN functions to redact credit card string values.\r\n\r\nEach of these functions converts a string 'input' representing a credit card number to an updated version applying a transformation to the characters. This can be useful for creating copies of tables with sensitive information removed, but retaining the same schema.\r\n\r\nBoth functions return an error if the format string is invalid.\r\n\r\nMASK_CCN returns an error if the input string does not match the format string.\r\n\r\nTRY_MASK_CCN instead returns NULL in that case.\r\n\r\nThe format can consist of the following characters, case insensitive:\r\n  - Each 'X' represents a digit which will be converted to 'X' in the result.\r\n  - Each digit '0'-'9' represents a digit which will be left unchanged in the result.\r\n  - Each '-' character should match exactly in the input string.\r\n  - The default format string is: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX.\r\n\r\nNo other format characters are allowed.\r\nAny leading or trailing whitespace in the input string is stripped out.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```\r\n> SELECT MASK_CCN(ccn) FROM VALUES (\"1234-5678-9876-5432\") AS tab(ccn);\r\n  XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX\r\n> SELECT MASK_CCN(\"  1234-5678-9876-5432  \", \"XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234\");\r\n  XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-5432\r\n> SELECT MASK_CCN(\"[1234-5678-9876-5432]\", \"[XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234]\");\r\n  Error: the format string is invalid\r\n> SELECT MASK_CCN(\"1234567898765432\");\r\n  Error: the input string does not match the format\r\n> SELECT MASK_CCN(\"1234567898765432\", \"XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234\");\r\n  Error: the input string does not match the format\r\n> SELECT TRY_MASK_CCN(\"1234567898765432\");\r\n  NULL\r\n> SELECT TRY_MASK_CCN(\"1234567898765432\", \"XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-1234\");\r\n  NULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese functions are useful for processing string values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it adds new SQL functions.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSingle task result must fit in 2GB, because we're using byte array or `ByteBuffer`(which is backed by byte array as well), and thus has a limit of 2GB(java array size limit on `byte[]`).\r\n\r\nThis PR is trying to fix this by replacing byte array with `ChunkedByteBuffer`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo overcome the 2GB limit for single task.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to migrate 48 compilation errors onto temporary error classes with the prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_13xx`. The error message will not include the error classes, so, in this way we will preserve the existing behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe migration on temporary error classes allows to gather statistics about errors and detect most popular error classes. After that we could prioritise the work on migration.\r\n\r\nThe new error class name prefix `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_` proposed here kind of marks the error as developer-facing, not user-facing. Developers can still get the error class programmatically via the `SparkThrowable` interface, so that they can build error infra with it. End users won't see the error class in the message. This allows us to do the error migration very quickly, and we can refine the error classes and mark them as user-facing later (naming them properly, adding tests, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. The error messages should be almost the same by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SQLQuerySuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

`onTaskStart()` calls as `onTaskCompletion()` for the same `stageId` & `stageAttemptId` pair is correct. But there is race condition between\r\n`getExecutorUpdates()` and `onTaskStart()`.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we have two different threads:\r\n- task runner: to execute the task and informs `ExecutorMetricsPoller` about task starts and completion\r\n- heartbeater: which uses the `ExecutorMetricsPoller` to get the metrics\r\n\r\nTo show the race condition assume a task just finished which was running on its own (no other tasks was running). \r\nSo this will decrease the `count` from 1 to 0.\r\n\r\nOn the task runner thread let say a new task starts. So the execution is in the `onTaskStart()` method \r\nlet's assume the `countAndPeaks` is already computed and here the counter is 0 \r\nbut the execution is still before incrementing the counter. So we are in between the following two lines:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n val countAndPeaks = stageTCMP.computeIfAbsent((stageId, stageAttemptId),\r\n      _ => TCMP(new AtomicLong(0), new AtomicLongArray(ExecutorMetricType.numMetrics)))\r\n val stageCount = countAndPeaks.count.incrementAndGet()\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's look at the other thread (heartbeater) where the `getExecutorUpdates()` is running and it is at the\r\n`removeIfInactive()` method:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n   def removeIfInactive(k: StageKey, v: TCMP): TCMP = {\r\n      if (v.count.get == 0) {\r\n        logDebug(s\"removing (${k._1}, ${k._2}) from stageTCMP\")\r\n        null\r\n      } else {\r\n        v\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here this entry is removed from `stageTCMP` as the count is 0.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to the task runner thread where we increase the counter to 1 but that value will be lost \r\nas we have no entry in the `stageTCMP` for this stage and attempt.\r\n\r\nSo if a new task comes instead of 2 we will have 1 in the `stageTCMP` and when those two tasks finishes \r\nthe second one will decrease the counter from 0 to -1. This is when the assert raised.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test.\r\n\r\n\r\nI managed to reproduce the issue with a temporary test:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n test(\"reproduce assert failure\") {\r\n    val testMemoryManager = new TestMemoryManager(new SparkConf())\r\n    val taskId = new AtomicLong(0)\r\n

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in the `MergeScalarSubqueries` rule for queries with subquery expressions nested inside each other, wherein the rule attempts to merge the nested subquery with its enclosing parent subquery. The result is not a valid plan and raises an exception in the optimizer. Here is a minimal reproducing case:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsql(\"create table test(col int) using csv\")\r\ncheckAnswer(sql(\"select(select sum((select sum(col) from test)) from test)\"), Row(null))\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo fix, we disable the optimization for subqueries with nested subqueries inside them for now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated existing unit tests and added the reproducing case as a new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to remove the error sub-class field from Spark exceptions, `checkError()` and from the machine-readable JSON format error message (`MINIMAL` and `STANDARD`, see the SQL config `spark.sql.error.messageFormat`), and include it to the original error class field using a dot. For example:\r\n\r\n#### Spark exception\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```scala\r\n    new SparkRuntimeException(\r\n      errorClass = \"UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE\",\r\n      errorSubClass = \"LITERAL_TYPE\",\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```scala\r\n    new SparkRuntimeException(\r\n      errorClass = \"UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.LITERAL_TYPE\",\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### JSON format\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"errorClass\" : \"UNRESOLVED_COLUMN\",\r\n  \"errorSubClass\" : \"WITH_SUGGESTION\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"errorClass\" : \"UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITH_SUGGESTION\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo simplify code and improve code maintenance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-09-29T17:27:39Z","updated_at":"2022-10-06T09:55:56Z","closed_at":"2022-10-06T09:55:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"13570a4736d1c42ae7a5326de2377d47e0657cca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/de7c6ba50a2e15642b4003971dd526625e39d8b5","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:eliminate-error-subclasses","ref":"eliminate-error-subclasses","sha":"de7c6ba50a2e15642b4003971dd526625e39d8b5","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR checks unsupported data types when decorrelating subqueries, and throws a more user-friendly error message if so. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere are certain data types (e.g MapType) that do not support ordering. This will cause the join conditions added by `DecorrelateInnerQuery` unresolved. We want to improve the error messages in this case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. This PR introduces a new error message. For example:\r\n```sql\r\n-- Suppose x is a map type column\r\nselect (select a + a from (select upper(x['a']) as a)) from v1\r\n```\r\nBefore this PR, this will throw an exception: \r\n```\r\nAfter applying rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.PullupCorrelatedPredicates in batch Pullup Correlated Expressions, the structural integrity of the plan is broken.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, this will throw an exception with a better error message:\r\n```\r\nCorrelated column reference 'v1.x' cannot be map type\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit
