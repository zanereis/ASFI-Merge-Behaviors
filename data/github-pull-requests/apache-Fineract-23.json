Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>pgjdbc/pgjdbc</summary>\n\n### [`v42.3.3`](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4233-2022-02-15-113224--0500)\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   fix: Removed loggerFile and loggerLevel configuration. While the properties still exist.\n    They can no longer be used to configure the driver logging. Instead use java.util.logging\n    configuration mechanisms such as `logging.properties`.\n\n##### Added\n\n##### Fixed\n\n### [`v42.3.2`](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/blob/HEAD/CHANGELOG.md#&#8203;4232-2022-02-01-073541--0500)\n\n##### Security\n\n-   CVE-2022-21724 pgjdbc instantiates plugin instances based on class names provided via authenticationPluginClassName,\n    sslhostnameverifier, socketFactory, sslfactory, sslpasswordcallback connection properties.\n    However, the driver did not verify if the class implements the expected interface before instantiating the class. This\n    would allow a malicious class to be instantiated that could execute arbitrary code from the JVM. Fixed in [commit](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/commit/f4d0ed69c0b3aae8531d83d6af4c57f22312c813)\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   perf: read in_hot_standby GUC on connection [PR #&#8203;2334](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2334)\n-   test: materialized view privileges [PR #&#8203;2209](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2209) fixes [Issue #&#8203;2060](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/issues/2060)\n-   docs: add info about convenience maven project [PR #&#8203;2407](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2407)\n-   docs: Document timezone reversal from POSIX to ISO [PR #&#8203;2413](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2413)\n-   fix: we will ask the server if it supports GSS Encryption if gssEncryption\n    is prefer or require [PR #&#8203;2396](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2396) remove the need to have a ticket in the cache before asking the server if gss encryptions are supported\n-   docs: remove Java 6 and 7 references from contributing [PR #&#8203;2385](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2385)\n-   style: remove Java 8 / JDBC 4.2 checks [PR #&#8203;2383](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2383) Remove all remaining checks whether the source is lower than Java 8\n    or JDBC 4.2.\n-   fix: throw SQLException for #getBoolean BIT(>1) [PR #&#8203;2386](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2386) Throw SQLException instead of ClassCastException when calling\n    CallableStatement#getBoolean(int) on BIT(>1).\n-   style: import java.time types in more classes [PR #&#8203;2382](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2382) Use imports for java.time types in all remaining classes.\n-   style: import java.time types in TimestampUtils [PR #&#8203;2380](https://togithub.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc/pull/2380) Use imports for java.time types in TimestampUtils.\n-   refactor: Change internal constructors to pass only connection Properties\n    Changes internal constructors for PgConnection and related classes to only accept the connection properties object and\n    remove the user and password arguments.

Added\n\n-   index.yaml to www.mock-server.com so it can be used as a helm chart repository\n-   command line flags can now be set as environment variables simplifying some container deployment scenarios\n-   glob support for initialisation files to allow multiple files to be specified\n-   request and response modifiers to dynamically update path, query parameters, headers, and cookies\n-   custom factory for key and certificates to provide more flexibility\n-   support for Open API expectations in json initialisation file\n-   improved [@&#8203;MockServerTest](https://togithub.com/MockServerTest) to support inheritance\n-   more flexibility over semicolon parsing for query parameters\n-   shaded jar for mockserver-netty and mockserver-client-java to reduce impact of dependency version mismatches with projects including these dependencies\n\n##### Changed\n\n-   ensured that TCP connections are closed immediately when shutting down to improved time before operating system frees the port\n-   reduce noise from Netty INFO logs that were not correct or misleading\n-   retrieveRecordedRequests now returns HttpRequest\\[]\n-   made it easier to set priority and id both in Java and Node clients in multiple places\n-   changed default charset for JSON and XML to UTF-8 from ISO 8859-1\n-   error handling for Open API so only single operation is skipped on failure not the entire file\n-   reduced over resolution of OpenAPI that triggered bugs in Swagger Parser V3 library\n-   replaces JDK FileWatcher with custom solution for watch file changes to work around multiple JDK bugs\n-   improved helm chart by supporting more configuration options\n-   remove explicit calls to System.gc()\n\n##### Fixed\n\n-   resolved multiple issues with clearing by expectation id\n-   resolved multiple issues with verifying by expectation id\n-   resolved multiple NullPointerExceptions in backend for UI\n-   ensure exact query parameter string is proxied allowing for empty values, leading `!` or or other special scenarios\n-   improved expectation updates from FileWatcher so only expecation from matching source are updated resolving multiple bugs\n-   ensured socket protocol of HTTPS is honoured resulting in forwarded requests using TLS\n-   fixed logging of exceptions such as port already bound at startup\n-   fixed retrieval of active exceptions where expectations were no longer active but not yet removed from expectations list\n-   no longer treat ndjson as json\n-   accessing UI via a

Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>liquibase/liquibase</summary>\n\n### [`v4.8.0`](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/releases/v4.8.0)\n\n#### Liquibase 4.8.0 release\n\nPlease report any issues to <https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/issues>.\n\n#### Notable Changes\n\nLiquibase  4.8.0 introduces the following functionality:\n\n-   The  `init hub`  subcommand that connects your local  Liquibase  activity to  Liquibase Hub  and sets up the  Liquibase  environment to use  Liquibase Hub. \\[DAT-8769]\n\n**Note:** For more information, see  [init hub](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/liquibase-start/init-hub.html)  and  [Getting Started with Liquibase Hub](https://docs.liquibase.com/tools-integrations/liquibase-hub/setup.html).\n\n-   \\[PRO] The  `sqlcmd`  utility support to process complex SQL for MSSQL Server.  Liquibase  provides the  `liquibase.sqlcmd.conf`  file to pass arguments to your executor when running  Liquibase Pro. \\[DAT-7447]\n\n**Note:** For more information, see  [Using the SQLCMD integration and runWith attribute with Liquibase Pro and MSSQL Server](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/changelogs/attributes/using-sqlcmd-integration.html).\n\n-   Changes to the behavior of the XML parser, which no longer allows referencing external DTD files for security reasons. If you use externally defined entities or any other potentially insecure XML feature in your  changelogs, set  `liquibase.secureParsing=false`.  \\[[PR#&#8203;2384](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2384)] \\[LB-2218]\n\n**Note:** For more information about the ways to set the parameter, see  [Command Parameters](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/command-parameters.html).\n\n-   The upgrade of the  `postgresql`  (from  `42.2.12`  to  `42.3.2`) and  `h2`  (from  `2.0.206`  to  `2.1.210`) drivers that  Liquibase  includes in the installation package. If you use those drivers and upgrade an existing  Liquibase  installation, remove the earlier versions of drivers from the  `LIQUIBASE_HOME/lib`  directory.\n\n#### Enhancements\n\n-   Implemented the  `SimpleObjectConstructor`  interface for DB2 on z/OS \\[DAT-8580]\n-   Included the CLI instructions on how to use the properties file with a nonstandard name when running the  `init project`  subcommand \\[DAT-9041]\n-   Improved the output message for  `init start-h2`  when the H2 database driver is specified, but there is no connection detected \\[DAT-8992]\n-   Added validation errors for the  `enableCheckConstraint`,  `disableCheckConstraint`,  `dropPackage`,  `dropPackageBody`  Change Types \\[DAT-9017]\n-   \\[[PR#&#8203;2367](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2367)] \\[[Mike Olivas](https://togithub.com/molivasdat)] Added example rollback scripts to the  `example-changelog.sql`  file \\[LB-2220]\n-   \\[[PR#&#8203;1648](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/1648)] \\[[Daniel Gray](https://togithub.com/danielthegray)] Improved the exception error message for the  `customChange`  node with no  `class`  attribute  \\[LB-1144]\n-   \\[[PR#&#8203;2222](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2222)] \\[[msimko81](https://togithub.com/msimko81)] Added the offline mode support for the  `rollback-sql <tag>`  operation \\[LB-2198]\n-   \\[[PR#&#8203;2273](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2273)] \\[[Tsvi Zandany](https://togithub.com/szandany)] Added the autocomplete quality checks commands for macOS\n-   \\[[PR#&#8203;2308](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2308)] \\[[Valentin Blistin](https://togithub.com/Delir4um)] Added the  `close`  method for the  `ClassLoaderResourceAccessor`  class \\[LB-2205]\n\n#### Fixes\n\n-   Fixed the  `renameSequence`  Change Type  generating an uppercase SQL instead of lowercase and causing failures with case-sensitive databases \\[LB-1763]\n-   Fixed the  `generate-changelog`  and  `diff`  commands to show and generate a proper SQL with autoincrement for PostgreSQL \\[DAT-8779]\n-   \\[[PR#&#8203;1320](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/1320)] \\[[PR#&#8203;2329](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2329)] \\[[Anatoly S](https://togithub.com/tolix)] \\[[Nathan Voxland](https://togithub.com/nvoxland)] \\[[Matteo Turra](https://togithub.com/matteoturra)] Improved the UTF-8 character support in the  `<sql>`  tags \\[LB-562]\n-   \\[[PR#&#8203;2139](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2139)] \\[[wziebicki](https://togithub.com/wziebicki)] Improved the  `UniqueConstraintSnapshotGenerator`  class to add a table name to the Oracle database query so that the cache key can contain it, and the unique constraint can be read from cache \\[LB-2206]\n-   \\[[PR#&#8203;2335](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2335)] \\[[erzsebet](https://togithub.com/XDelphiGrl)] Removed duplicated  DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK  SQL statements when running the  `update-sql`  command against a new database \\[LB-2208]\n-   \\[[PR#&#8203;2505](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2505)] \\[[Nathan Voxland](https://togithub.com/nvoxland)] \\[[Dries Samyn](https://togithub.com/driessamyn)] \\[[erzsebet](https://togithub.com/XDelphiGrl)] Fixed the OSGI support with the  `MANIFEST.MF`  file in the  `liquibase-core-4.7.0.jar`  file.

For example, you do not want to have a dash in the table, column, and sequence names. With the multiple objects check, you can specify a pattern to check for dashes and choose tables, columns, and sequences as the objects to check. In version 4.6.2, the check is available for:\n\n-   Table\n-   Column\n-   Sequence\n\n**Note:** For more information, see  [Multiple Objects Quality Check](https://docs.liquibase.com/commands/community/quality-checks/multiple-objects.html)  \\[DAT-8444]\n\n##### The logging of SQL statements and execution output\n\nLiquibase  4.6.2 includes the  `liquibase.sql.logLevel`  configuration option to control the level at which SQL is logged. The default value is  `FINE`.\n\nYou can run the  `--sql-log-level`  parameter with the  `--log-level <level>`  parameter in the CLI:\n\n```text\nliquibase --sql-log-level <FINE|INFO|SEVERE|WARNING|OFF> --log-level=<FINE|INFO|SEVERE|WARNING|OFF> --log-file=log.txt update --changelog-file=<changelog>\n```\n\nYou can also set the parameter as follows:\n\n-   `liquibase.sql.logLevel: <FINE|INFO|SEVERE|WARNING|OFF>`  in your  `liquibase.properties`  file\n-   `LIQUIBASE_SQL_LOG_LEVEL=<FINE|INFO|SEVERE|WARNING|OFF>`  as an environment variable \\[[PR#&#8203;1520](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/1520)] \\[[nvoxland](https://togithub.com/nvoxland)]\n\n##### An additional  `liquibase_libs`  directory\n\nWhen you run Liquibase in the CLI, the executables generate a classpath with the  `.jar`  files from the  `LIQUIBASE_HOME`  and  `LIQUIBASE_HOME/lib`  directories. Liquibase 4.6.2 adds the ability to load an additional directory of  `liquibase_libs`  in the current working directory to the classpath. With the  `liquibase_libs`  directory located in the `/lib`  directory, projects can have separate extensions, drivers, and versions specific to a project \\[[PR#&#8203;2015](https://togithub.com/liquibase/liquibase/pull/2015)] \\[[mcred](https://togithub.com/mcred)]\n\n##### The  `validate`  command in automation\n\nFrom now on, the exit code for the  `validate`  command running in automation shows  `1`  when there is an error.

shutdown behavior of a polling thread. The wrong time unit was used causing executor shutdown to take way more time than expected in cases where it's stuck. Thanks to Claus Näveke for spotting this and for the initial PR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fixed a bug in which condition was not evaluated correctly with small intervals, such as:\nawait().atMost(Duration.ofMillis(10)).pollInterval(Duration.ofMillis(5)).until(..);\n(issue 224). Thanks to Robby Decosemaeker for PR.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded the awaitility-kotlin module to use kotlin 1.6.10</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fail fast conditions can now be specified with assertions. For example:</p>\n<p>await().failFast(() -&gt; assertThat(state).isNotEqualTo(&quot;Failed&quot;)).until(..);</p>\n<p>(issue 238)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/b5d82b703caa88b2ddc2ae0d06020c286d023a79\"><code>b5d82b7</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release awaitility-4.2.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/1ae03495d5a76298ae03f64b1209bc63f049d6b6\"><code>1ae0349</code></a> Preparing changelog for release</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/386eccb7369b6bdb0e434980a0c39ec7c70405a9\"><code>386eccb</code></a> Improve error message in test</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/fc45eb743e7f3a2aec2d57f6d3efd11165c9de44\"><code>fc45eb7</code></a> Fail fast conditions can now be specified with assertions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/d39c00d76af752cfede573453aa904c761c5f6f6\"><code>d39c00d</code></a> Upgrading Kotlin to 1.6.10</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/f359e945794f1c2fc99c6a2cb1b7ac8638394cb8\"><code>f359e94</code></a> Formatted ConditionAwaiter</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/9c9a79bbb8c4a9c1cf5b8822a310e3b9161d07a4\"><code>9c9a79b</code></a> Updated changelog to reflect the latest changes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/9e40d37614fae55588b7d512a447f76804f3e312\"><code>9e40d37</code></a> Fix <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/awaitility/awaitility/issues/224\">#224</a> - handle immidiate success scenario (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/awaitility/awaitility/issues/228\">#228</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/commit/3c9f3450ca3bcf7dd53f8fcf2f7c06675350d9cc\"><code>3c9f345</code></a> Fixed a bug in the shutdown behavior of a polling thread.

This\nwould allow a malicious class to be instantiated that could execute arbitrary code from the JVM.

href=\"https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/blob/master/changelog.txt\">rest-assured's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Changelog 4.5.1 (2022-02-11)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed a bug in ObjectMapper that required JAXB/JakartaEE when this was not intended (issue 1542)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Changelog 4.5.0 (2022-01-21)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>JAXB is now an optional dependency for XmlPath and is now longer required. Depend on 'jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api:2.3.3' and 'com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl:2.3.3'</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Implemented support for serializing and deserializing with Jakarta EE 8 and 9. To use it you need to have Jakarta EE on the classpath, for example by depending on 'jakarta.xml.bind:jakarta.xml.bind-api:3.0.1' and 'org.glassfish.jaxb:jaxb-runtime:3.0.2'.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Upgraded groovy from 3.0.8 to 3.0.9 (thanks to sullis for pull request)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Added support for adding multiple LogDetails to the RequestLoggingFilter. You can now do e.g.:</p>\n<p>given().filter(RequestLoggingFilter.with(LogDetail.METHOD, LogDetail.HEADERS, LogDetail.BODY)).when(). ..</p>\n<p>Thanks to lucasnguyen17 for pull request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix default implementation of deprecated method detachRoot (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/issues/1503\">#1503</a>) (thanks to Guillaume Boucherie for pull request)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add on fail message builder for response specification (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/issues/1502\">#1502</a>). This means that you can no do:\nwhen().\nget().\nthen().\nonFailMessage(&quot;Some specific message&quot;).\nstatusCode(200);\nThe &quot;onFailMessage&quot; will be shown in the error. This is good if you want to e.g. distinguish more easily between tests if they fail.

Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The options <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> and <code>skip-stale-pr-message</code> were removed. Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number.

Instead, setting the options <code>stale-issue-message</code> and <code>stale-pr-message</code> will be enough to let the stale workflow add a comment. If the options are unset, a comment will not be added which was the equivalent of setting <code>skip-stale-issue-message</code> to <code>true</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>operations-per-run</code> option will be more effective. After migrating, you could face a failed-fast process workflow if you let the default value (30) or set it to a small number. In that case, you will see a warning at the end of the logs (if enabled) indicating that the workflow was stopped sooner to avoid consuming too much API calls.

support for <code>webpack-dev-server@4</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>ES Module output bundle path now points to <code>swagger-ui-es-bundle-core</code>, which does not include dependencies</li>\n<li>No change to CommonJS output bundle or path</li>\n<li>Now uses Asset Modules, which replaces <code>file-loader</code>, <code>raw-loader</code>, and <code>url-loader</code></li>\n<li>Removed unused rules/loaders for <code>.woff | .woff2 | .ttf | .eot</code> fonts and html</li>\n<li>Node polyfills are no longer bundled with <code>webpack@5</code>, and must be loaded separately and/or use <code>resolve.fallback</code>. As an example, SwaggerUI loads <code>process</code>, <code>buffer</code>, and <code>stream-browserify</code> as <code>devDependencies</code> in order to build development and production bundles.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>SwaggerUI-React:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now imports <code>swagger-ui-es-bundle-core</code>, and similarly outputs <code>swagger-ui-es-bundle-core</code> to its <code>dist</code> directory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dev:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Order of execution matters for the production npm build scripts. <code>build-stylesheets</code> needs to get built first,\nthen cleanup of any empty artifacts, before building the various production bundles</li>\n<li><code>Dev-helpers</code> now relies on <code>HTMLWebpackPlugin</code> to inject css and bundle files</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Swagger UI v4.5.2 Released!</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/compare/v4.5.1...v4.5.2\">4.5.2</a> (2022-02-21)</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>swagger-ui-react:</strong> load spec on initial render (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/7856\">#7856</a>) (<a href=\"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/commit/a81341d25f259a1e164a7ed5760d540d3d75b873\">a81341d</a>), closes <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/7578\">#7578</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Swagger UI v4.5.1 Released!</h2>\n<h2><a href=\"https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/compare/v4.5.0...v4.5.1\">4.5.1</a> (2022-02-19)</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

WebhookService to support all paths instead of only absolute path. \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nCurrent Implementation supports Webhook URL with absolute path like https://www.hostname.com but it does not support urls like https://www.hostname.com/v1/api/webhook/ or https://www.hostname.com/webhook/ \r\n\r\n**Currently Webhook URLs working** : Only AbsoluteUrls  as baseURL (http://www.hostname.com/)\r\n**URLs Not working** : Relative Paths in baseURL like http://www.hostname.com/v1/api/webhook \r\n\r\n**Root Cause :** This problem is happening due to retrofit2 library as it removes relative path from baseURL due to \"/\" present in request like Get(\"/\") , POST(\"/\") etc. So it updates http://www.hostname.com/v1/api/webhook  to http://www.hostname.com/ while making API call and hence we get 404 error.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Resolution** : \r\nSo in order to support absolute url as well as all other relative URL Paths,  I updated Webhook Service Code and replaced GET(\"/\") by GET(\".\") So that retrofit2 library does not remove anything from baseURL. I tested code and it is working fine with both kind of URLs.\r\n\r\nIgnore if these details are present on the associated [Apache Fineract JIRA ticket](https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1284).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request - thanks!\r\n\r\n- [x] Write the commit message as per https://github.com/apache/fineract/#pull-requests\r\n\r\n- [x] Acknowledge that we will not review PRs that are not passing the build _(\"green\")_ - it is your responsibility to get a proposed PR to pass the build, not primarily the project's maintainers.\r\n\r\n- [x] Create/update unit or integration tests for verifying the changes made.\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow coding conventions at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Coding+Conventions.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add required Swagger annotation and update API documentation at fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/api-docs/apiLive.htm with details of any API changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Submission is not a \"code dump\".

Functionality description\r\nFull change from Flyway migrations to Liquibase migration. The Liquibase migration files have been generated using Liquibase CLI and based on the latest develop commit (c66415dbfdcb54ff9dada4fdcee603fba7a151e2). There have been a couple manual changes to the changesets in the generated migrations since there were a few issues where the ordering of changes wasn't right or when the code was depending on some certain database naming for unique key constraints.\r\n\r\nThe change includes an automatic forward schema upgrade from Flyway to Liquibase. There's no need to do anything manually. Upon startup, Fineract will decide on the status of the database - whether it's empty, whether it was running Flyway on the latest 1.6 Fineract version or if the database state represents a previous version of Fineract.\r\n\r\nThe automatic upgrade works in 3 different ways depending on the scenario\r\n* If the database is completely empty, it's going to apply all changesets from the Liquibase changelogs\r\n* If the database contains the changes from the last Flyway migration scripts included in Fineract 1.6. In that case, a seamless upgrade is going to happen to Liquibase\r\n* If the database contains Flyway changes but it's not running the latest migration scripts from 1.6 - i.e. the Fineract version being ran is pre-1.6. In that case the application startup will fail, notifying the operator in the logs that first they shall upgrade to 1.6 and then to 1.7\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nOn top of the tests written for the changes the following cases have been checked manually, all of them passed successfully\r\n* Starting from an empty db\r\n* Starting from an empty db and then applying one new changeset\r\n* Starting from an existing flyway migrated db\r\n* Starting from an existing flyway migrated db and then applying one new changeset\r\n* Starting from an existing flyway migrated db which is not running the latest structure on tenant store, app should fail\r\n* Starting from an existing flyway migrated db which is not running the latest structure on tenant, app should fail\r\n* Starting from an existing flyway migrated db which is not running the latest structure on tenant but upgrades to 1.6 then applies Liquibase changes\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request - thanks!\r\n\r\n- [x] Write the commit message as per https://github.com/apache/fineract/#pull-requests\r\n\r\n- [x] Acknowledge that we will not review PRs that are not passing the build _(\"green\")_ - it is your responsibility to get a proposed PR to pass the build, not primarily the project's maintainers.\r\n\r\n- [x] Create/update unit or integration tests for verifying the changes made.\r\n\r\n- [x] Follow coding conventions at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FINERACT/Coding+Conventions.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add required Swagger annotation and update API documentation at fineract-provider/src/main/resources/static/api-docs/apiLive.htm with details of any API changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Submission is not a \"code dump\".

Description\r\n\r\nThe current process of selecting the authentication strategy for Fineract is unnecessarily complicated. Spring profiles are not the best way to enable/disable these features. By using \"@ConditionalOnProperty\" we only need one build and can enable the required authentication scheme with environment variables.
