Dashboard color configurations might need syncing and persistence in the backend even when the user takes no action. For instance, new data might appear on the dashboard that needs to be synced with the color maps and persisted. Previously, these changes would be saved using the dashboard PUT endpoint, causing that the dashboard last modified date would show up as updated even though no change was made from the user perspective, causing confusion. Also, issues have surfaced where metadata that wasn't meant to be persisted yet would go along with the updated color metadata, causing unexpected behaviors.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a Dashboard\r\n2. Make sure new data appeared (new dimensions or metrics)\r\n3. Observe how a network request is made to store the color metadata when leaving the dashboard\r\n4. Make sure the last modified date of the Dashboard hasn't changed\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhile in embedded mode, one could argue that sharing should be disabled since the links do not work in embed mode and clicking them will redirect a  `GUEST_USER` to the `standalone` version of superset and will hit a \"login wall\". \r\nSuch a share link is http://localhost:8088/superset/dashboard/p/4aRGDe0MLmo/. See the screenshot below.\r\n\r\nIn my experience it is enough to:\r\n- ensure the role used as `GUEST_ROLE_NAME` lacks the following permissions\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"permission\": { \"name\": \"can_export\" },\r\n    \"view_menu\": { \"name\": \"Dashboard\" }\r\n},\r\n{\r\n    \"permission\": { \"name\": \"can_export\" },\r\n    \"view_menu\": { \"name\": \"Chart\" }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n- conditionally render the share links for Tab title and Chart title based on the permissions listed above\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\nClickable links\r\n<img width=\"669\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 22 31 02\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0878191b-bdc6-43f2-9820-f1a07c0ec582\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"813\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-09 at 22 31 09\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3aad80ee-8ca3-4a90-9cea-27844d06a2b7\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nI used a user WITHOUT the following permissions\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"permission\": { \"name\": \"can_export\" },\r\n    \"view_menu\": {

[https://github.com/apache/superset/security/code-scanning/1226](https://github.com/apache/superset/security/code-scanning/1226)\n\nTo fix the problem, we should ensure that all HTML tags are removed from the input string, even if they are nested or malformed. One way to achieve this is to repeatedly apply the regular expression replacement until no more replacements can be performed. This approach ensures that all instances of HTML tags are removed.\n\nWe will modify the `removeHTMLTags` function to apply the regular expression replacement in a loop until the input string no longer changes. This ensures that all HTML tags are removed, regardless of their structure.\n\n\n_Suggested fixes powered by Copilot Autofix. Review carefully before merging._\n","created_at":"2024-12-09T20:17:31Z","updated_at":"2025-01-11T01:16:58Z","closed_at":"2025-01-11T01:16:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6fb4218ad9e3591e4ca8bc3e2eddde96d0ce593b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329183122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MTgzMTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/XS","name":"size/XS","color":"E2D8FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2630106047,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjMwMTA2MDQ3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset-io","name":"preset-io","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6502628977,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABg5Y-cQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/packages","name":"packages","color":"E795E1","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/31358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/31358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/issues/31358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/statuses/e57d99586473c5815f877791cadf22aa186e3919","head":{"label":"apache:alert-autofix-1226","ref":"alert-autofix-1226","sha":"e57d99586473c5815f877791cadf22aa186e3919","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39464018,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTQ2NDAxOA==","name":"superset","full_name":"apache/superset","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/superset","description":"Apache

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n#### Problem\r\nAt issue is a broken link on the main docs intro page (https://superset.apache.org/docs/intro). This bug was introduced after a previous PR:  [docs: various improvements across the docs](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/28285), which removed the intro.md file from the superset/docs/docs subdirectory after deeming it redundant. This change had the unintended consequence of breaking the link for the \"Edit this page on GitHub\" button on the main docs/intro site page. This is because the docusaurus.config.js is currently configured to return a path of 'https://github.com/apache/superset/edit/master/docs/' + docPath. While this works fine for the other sidebar items that are still housed in the docs/docs subdirectory, it needs updating for the intro page, which is currently built from the main repo README.md file.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\nAdd a custom editURL function to the docusaurus.config.js file so that the intro page will now properly redirect to the main repo README.md file, and the remaining sidebar links will remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nLink Location:\r\n![Screen Shot 2024-11-19 at 11 25 44 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f488c6e6-5772-49cf-ade9-693ef21e4da2)\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![Screen Shot 2024-11-19 at 11 26 13 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6756c3b-c7b5-4130-b701-35c42406fc4b)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![Screen Shot 2024-12-07 at 1 09 11 AM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b215dcf4-294a-45e9-b44d-4cb7fda59df2)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nChange the docusaurus.config.js file as suggested and check that the intro page link is working correctly.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen a y axis sort is selected with a stacked bar chart with totals shown, the y axis column value was being added to the total. This pr checks that only the metrics are being used in calculating totals by passing in the list of metrics labels to the total calculation function, and only totaling the columns that are metrics, not the ones used in sorting.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e01469e1-096b-433e-903a-8259a022d3de)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"2323\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 4 54 10 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ebd321c-4ead-4fe6-974d-fc0b9df8f91e\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen extracting tables from a Jinja template we're passing a `jinja2.nodes.Template` object to the `process_template` method, but it expects a string.  This can cause errors depending on the `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` feature flag and the SQL dialect.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the logic to re-render the modified template before passing it as a string to `process_template`.\r\n\r\n(Note that a `jinja2.nodes.Template` is an internal object, different from a `jinja2.environment.Template`.)\r\n\r\n**Why wasn't this caught before?**\r\n\r\nThis only happens when `ENABLE_TEMPLATE_PROCESSING` is off. When the feature flag is ON we use the `JinjaTemplateProcessor`, which parses the string passed to `process_template` using `env.from_string`. Despite the name, `env.from_string` **also works** on `jinja2.nodes.Template` objects, so the template is rendered correctly and `process_template` returns valid SQL.\r\n\r\nWhen the feature flag is OFF we use the `NoOpTemplateProcessor` to extract tables, which just returns `str(sql)` in its `process_template`. This converts the `jinja2.nodes.Template` into a string that can't be parsed correctly _most of the time_:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTemplate(body=[Output(nodes=[TemplateData(data='SELECT 1 FROM t')])])\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfusingly, the string above **is a valid SQL expression depending on the dialect**:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import sqlglot\r\n>>> sqlglot.parse(\"Template(body=[Output(nodes=[TemplateData(data='SELECT 1 FROM t')])])\")\r\n[Anonymous(\r\n  this=Template,\r\n  expressions=[\r\n    EQ(\r\n      this=Column(\r\n        this=Identifier(this=body, quoted=False)),\r\n      expression=Array(\r\n        expressions=[\r\n          Anonymous(\r\n            this=Output,\r\n            expressions=[\r\n              EQ(\r\n                this=Column(\r\n                  this=Identifier(this=nodes, quoted=False)),\r\n                expression=Array(\r\n                  expressions=[\r\n                    Anonymous(\r\n                      this=TemplateData,\r\n                      expressions=[\r\n                        EQ(\r\n                          this=Column(\r\n                            this=Identifier(this=data, quoted=False)),\r\n                          expression=Literal(this=SELECT 1 FROM t, is_string=True))])]))])]))])]\r\n>>> sqlglot.parse(\"Template(body=[Output(nodes=[TemplateData(data='SELECT 1 FROM t')])])\", \"tsql\")\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/beto/.pyenv/versions/superset/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlglot/__init__.py\", line 102, in parse\r\n    return Dialect.get_or_raise(read or dialect).parse(sql, **opts)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/beto/.pyenv/versions/superset/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlglot/dialects/dialect.py\", line 919, in parse\r\n    return self.parser(**opts).parse(self.tokenize(sql), sql)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/beto/.pyenv/versions/superset/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlglot/parser.py\", line 1398, in parse\r\n    return self._parse(\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/Users/beto/.pyenv/versions/superset/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlglot/parser.py\", line 1470, in _parse\r\n    self.raise_error(\"Invalid expression / Unexpected token\")\r\n  File \"/Users/beto/.pyenv/versions/superset/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlglot/parser.py\", line 1511, in raise_error\r\n    raise error\r\nsqlglot.errors.ParseError: Invalid expression / Unexpected token.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSuperset uses sqlglot to parse queries. It is not obvious in what cases it performs parsing and in what cases it doesnt, but we see an error where we are not able to use backticks and slashes in SQL Lab while creating datasets.\r\nFor example, query like\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM `prefix/some_name`\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill fail because no sqlglot dialect is defined for YDB.\r\n\r\nTo have an ability to use db's with slashes we can use clickhouse's sqlglot dialect until we make our own.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/31322\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

number of connection to the metadata database, in our case postgres, is limited, and when we have a lot of pods autoscale, at some point we can hit the maximum postgres connection, upon which point new pods/request can't get a new connection. Typically this happens when a database like Redshift or Presto is queuing up, and requests to the analytics database are hanging. People get impatient and force-refresh their dashboards, which make it even worst, piling up lots of web threads that are all just waiting for analytics db, and each one is hogging a metadata database connection.\r\n\r\nThis PR add a new feature flag (false by default) `DISABLE_METADATA_DB_DURING_ANALYTICS`, that uses a context manager to disconnect and reconnect to the database during long blocking operations, like waiting for an analytics query to return a result. This works only in conjunction with NullPool for now, but could be extended to work with various pool configurations.\r\n\r\n~~Also, for convenience, adding another `SIMULATE_SLOW_ANALYTICS_DATABASE` feature flag that introduces a 60 seconds sleep to make it easier to test this.~~\r\n\r\nNote that net-net this PR it's a no-op with the default feature flags.\r\n\r\nOne question is whether we scrap this PR and chain it behind a large refactor, call it \"untangle and centralize all analytics database interaction in the `superset/db_engine_spec/` package\". Goal there would be to move all analytics database operations in one place. One issue is that database interactions are somewhat tangled with Superset-specific logic, things like interaction with the cache manager, updating progress/status in the `Query` table, ... I think the way we'd handle it is by passing objects like the cache_manager to `db_engine_spec`, and even things like callbacks if needed.","created_at":"2024-12-05T23:31:43Z","updated_at":"2024-12-10T03:47:38Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"villebro","id":33317356,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzE3MzU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33317356?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro","html_url":"https://github.com/villebro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/villebro/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"michael-s-molina","id":70410625,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDEwNjI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70410625?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina","html_url":"https://github.com/michael-s-molina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michael-s-molina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"giftig","id":2862039,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4NjIwMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2862039?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig","html_url":"https://github.com/giftig","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/giftig/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis pr aims to replace Moment.js with Day.js as the former is a legacy project and is in maintenance mode. There were some design decisions made:\r\n\r\n1. Datepicker component in Ant Design v4 accepts Moment object as props. There are couple options to remedy that:\r\n - Use a temporary plugin to allow Datepicker v4 to accept Day.js.\r\n - Refactor the Datepicker to allow Day.js.\r\n - Mark the usages to complete Day.js migration in the Datepicker pr #31019\r\n \r\nI decided on the last option since other two seemed overkill for a temporary hurdle.\r\n\r\n2. Extensions\r\nDay.js object needed to be extended to support our usages. I centralized that in `extendedDayjs` to prevent confusion. Alternative to this is to extend where its used.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\nFixes #30877\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR resolves an issue where annotation layers data were not updated when the chart orientation changed to horizontal. Previously, while x and y axis chart data were swapped, the annotation layers data were not transformed accordingly.\r\n\r\nI decided to change the data in transform annotation functions based on the new `orientation` optional prop. I could use `isHorizontal`, but I think the `orientation` prop will provide better readability with `OrientationType.Horizontal` instead of `true`.\r\n\r\nI created tests specifically for the changes, focusing on the chart data transform and the data changes when chart is horizontal.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore\r\n![Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 17 56 14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb6f1000-269e-48e3-a785-23363f725e7a)\r\n\r\nAfter\r\n![Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 17 50 47](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6940177-748c-4a56-aa6e-3958845f90a7)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to implement helper functions that will provide standard interfaces for the most used methods found in the migrations for the past 2 years, which are: create and drop tables, add and drop columns, create and drop indexes. Another objective to make logging standard among migrations by providing more human readable logs and displaying the same type of information.\r\n\r\nThese new functions will apply some validations before executing such as: \r\n- When adding/dropping a column, does this column already exist on the table? \r\n- Does the index to be created is already present on the table? \r\n\r\nThese types of validations will make the migrations more resilient. The added helper functions and their logs are:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef create_table(table_name: str, *columns: SchemaItem) -> None:\r\n\r\nINFO [alembic] Creating table temp_table…\r\nINFO [alembic] Table temp_table created\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef drop_table(table_name: str) -> None:\r\n\r\nINFO  [alembic] Dropping table temp_table...\r\nINFO  [alembic] Table temp_table dropped\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef add_columns(table_name: str, *columns: Column) -> None:\r\n\r\nINFO [alembic] Adding column new_id on table temp_table\r\nINFO [alembic] Column id already present on table temp_table Skipping…\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef drop_columns(table_name: str, *columns: str) -> None:\r\n\r\nINFO  [alembic] Column address is not present on table temp_table Skipping...\r\nINFO  [alembic] Dropping column new_id from table temp_table\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef create_index(table_name: str, index_name: str, *columns: str) -> None:\r\n\r\nINFO [alembic] Creating index my_index on table temp_table\r\nINFO [alembic] Table temp_table already has index my_index Skipping…\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef drop_index(table_name: str, index_name: str) -> None:\r\n\r\nINFO  [alembic] Dropping index my_index from table temp_table\r\nINFO  [alembic] Table temp_table doesn't have index other_index Skipping...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere’s also a new method for executing database operations in batch. This function will receive a `Callable`, the `count` and `batch_size` as the parameters. When executing, the `Callable` will receive the offset and limit for the current processed batch.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef batch_operation(callable: Callable[[int, int], None], count: int, batch_size: int) -> None:\r\n\r\nINFO [alembic] Progress: 0/100,000 (0.00%)\r\nINFO [alembic] Progress: 25,000/100,000 (25.00%)\r\nINFO [alembic] Progress: 50,000/100,000 (50.00%)\r\nINFO [alembic] Progress: 75.000/100,000 (75.00%)\r\nINFO [alembic] Progress: 100,000/100,000 (100%)\r\nINFO [alembic] End: callable_example batch operation successfully executed\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nExecute the migrations using `superset db upgrade` and superset db downgrade` commands and make sure everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-05T13:59:39Z","updated_at":"2024-12-11T13:51:18Z","closed_at":"2024-12-11T13:50:56Z","merged_at":"2024-12-11T13:50:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"423a0fefa5e024db9fbf75301997c511b3ec992f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":415794708,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MTU3OTQ3MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/change:backend","name":"change:backend","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Requires

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, there is a significant bottleneck when executing queries in sqllab due to the delay in `update_saved_query_exec_info`. \r\n\r\n![Superset](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e1512cd-87c9-48b7-9163-acdb285ef042)\r\n\r\n![392578130-07d5b578-3beb-4797-a982-49ab524572bb_png__1197×268_](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03524ab7-904a-40ba-8bf8-89673339febe)\r\n\r\nAccording to #11391, the information obtained during the `update_saved_query_exec_info` was added for display on the homepage, but it has been confirmed that the recently changed_date is actually being used.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate smoother execution of sqllab queries, this commit removes the `update_saved_query_exec_info` part. Additionally, it changed the displayed label (from `ran` to `modified`) on the homepage to reflect the actual data.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI and specs\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

SUMMARY\r\nIn the thread execution function, the query is referenced, and since it occupies the session within the thread scope, it became impossible to perform session transactions related to the query in the handle_cursor that runs separately.\r\nThis resulted in errors for multi-statement queries. This commit changes the code to ensure that the database object is only referenced in the thread, thereby separating the session scope.\r\nAdditionally, it resolves the issue where handle_cursor would skip sleep when a multi-statement is executing, allowing access before execution.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-11-25 18:35:16,271:DEBUG:superset.db_engine_specs.trino:Query 18151072: Handling

Shouldn't be controversial. File under simplify/accelerate builds/devex/tooling.\r\n\r\nThe case for pylint deprecation:\r\n- mostly covered by ruff: what matters most in pylint is already re-implemented\r\n- pylint is SLOW, ruff is a million times faster - pre-commit / pylint is one of our longest, most expensive CI step\r\n- rules are currently scattered in different places and can conflict at times\r\n- checked in with the Airflow community, they went all in on `ruff`, deprecated `pylint` and are extremely happy with the switch\r\n\r\nVery relevant is this link that explains what pylint features are covered or not by ruff:\r\nhttps://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/970\r\n\r\nEssentially we can simplify & speed things up here..\r\n\r\nIf we agree on the direction, the plan is to follow up and enable all the rules, apply `ruff check --fix` and `ruff check --add-no-qa`, which will enable the set of rules commented now, fix the obvious, and add a `# noqa` to the lines that are not immediately

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds two new helpers to the Handlebars chart:\r\n* `formatNumber`: allows using `number.toLocaleString(locale)` to format numbers as needed.\r\n* `group` (via the [handlebars-group-by module](https://github.com/shannonmoeller/handlebars-group-by)): Allows grouping data.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nExample using both helpers:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9e983e2-ac0e-4b2e-9281-751d3768b40b)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a Handlebars chart using the `cleaned_sales_data` dataset.\r\n2. Use `year` and `deal_size` as dimensions and create any metric with the `test_metric` label.\r\n3. Use below Handlebars template:\r\n```\r\n{{#group data by=\"year\"}}\r\n<h3>Year: {{ value }}</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n{{#each items}}\r\n\t<li>{{ deal_size }} deals: {{ formatNumber test_metric \"de-DE\"}}</li>\r\n{{/each}}\r\n</ul>\r\n{{/group}}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR supersedes https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30958.\r\nRelated to PRs: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31240, https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31241, https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31242, https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31244.\r\n\r\nOptimizes utils and components related to native filters and cross filters. Many util functions, such as `useSelectChartTabParents` or `getCrossFilterIndicator` were suboptimal, running some operations unnecessarily, and were being called from components redundantly. This PR implements memoization in filter bar components, improves Redux selectors and optimizes the util functions.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nFor detailed perf improvement results, see the details in PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30958\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nNo functional changes - the dashboard, native filters, cross filters, chart actions, etc. should work like before\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ]

this, you should either be pinning the exact version of <code>esbuild</code> in your <code>package.json</code> file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as <code>^0.23.0</code> or <code>~0.23.0</code>. See npm's documentation about <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/\">semver</a> for more information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Drop support for older platforms (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3902\">#3902</a>)</p>\n<p>This release drops support for the following operating system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>macOS 10.15 Catalina</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is because the Go programming language dropped support for this operating system version in Go 1.23, and this release updates esbuild from Go 1.22 to Go 1.23. Go 1.23 now requires macOS 11 Big Sur or later.</p>\n<p>Note that this only affects the binary esbuild executables that are published to the esbuild npm package. It's still possible to compile esbuild's source code for these older operating systems. If you need to, you can compile esbuild for yourself using an older version of the Go compiler (before Go version 1.23). That might look something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/evanw/esbuild.git\ncd esbuild\ngo build ./cmd/esbuild\n./esbuild --version\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix class field decorators in TypeScript if <code>useDefineForClassFields</code> is <code>false</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3913\">#3913</a>)</p>\n<p>Setting the <code>useDefineForClassFields</code> flag to <code>false</code> in <code>tsconfig.json</code> means class fields use the legacy TypeScript behavior instead of the standard JavaScript behavior. Specifically they use assign semantics instead of define semantics (e.g. setters are triggered) and fields without an initializer are not initialized at all. However, when this legacy behavior is combined with standard JavaScript decorators, TypeScript switches to always initializing all fields, even those without initializers. Previously esbuild incorrectly continued to omit field initializers for this edge case. These field initializers in this case should now be emitted starting with this release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid incorrect cycle warning with <code>tsconfig.json</code> multiple inheritance (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3898\">#3898</a>)</p>\n<p>TypeScript 5.0 introduced multiple inheritance for <code>tsconfig.json</code> files where <code>extends</code> can be an array of file paths. Previously esbuild would incorrectly treat files encountered more than once when processing separate subtrees of the multiple inheritance hierarchy as an inheritance cycle. With this release, <code>tsconfig.json</code> files containing this edge case should work correctly without generating a warning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Handle Yarn Plug'n'Play stack overflow with <code>tsconfig.json</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3915\">#3915</a>)</p>\n<p>Previously a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file that <code>extends</code> another file in a package with an <code>exports</code> map could cause a stack overflow when Yarn's Plug'n'Play resolution was active. This edge case should work now starting with this release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work around more issues with Deno 1.31+ (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3917\">#3917</a>)</p>\n<p>This version of Deno broke the <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> properties on command objects for inherited streams, which matters when you run esbuild's Deno module as the entry point (i.e. when <code>import.meta.main</code> is <code>true</code>). Previously esbuild would crash in Deno 1.31+ if you ran esbuild like that. This should be fixed starting with this release.</p>\n<p>This fix was contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/Joshix-1\"><code>@​Joshix-1</code></a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v0.23.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allow using the <code>node:</code> import prefix with <code>es*</code> targets (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3821\">#3821</a>)</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#node-imports\"><code>node:</code> prefix on imports</a> is an alternate way to import built-in node modules. For example, <code>import fs from &quot;fs&quot;</code> can also be written <code>import fs from &quot;node:fs&quot;</code>. This only works with certain newer versions of node, so esbuild removes it when you target older versions of node such as with <code>--target=node14</code> so that your code still works. With the way esbuild's platform-specific feature compatibility table works, this was added by saying that only newer versions of node support this feature. However, that means that a target such as <code>--target=node18,es2022</code> removes the <code>node:</code> prefix because none of the <code>es*</code> targets are known to support this feature. This release adds the support for the <code>node:</code> flag to esbuild's internal compatibility table for <code>es*</code> to allow you to use compound targets like this:</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>// Original code\nimport fs from 'node:fs'\nfs.open\n<p>// Old output (with --bundle --format=esm --platform=node --target=node18,es2022)<br />\nimport fs from &quot;fs&quot;;<br />\n</code></pre></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

However, when this legacy behavior is combined with standard JavaScript decorators, TypeScript switches to always initializing all fields, even those without initializers. Previously esbuild incorrectly continued to omit field initializers for this edge case. These field initializers in this case should now be emitted starting with this release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoid incorrect cycle warning with <code>tsconfig.json</code> multiple inheritance (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3898\">#3898</a>)</p>\n<p>TypeScript 5.0 introduced multiple inheritance for <code>tsconfig.json</code> files where <code>extends</code> can be an array of file paths. Previously esbuild would incorrectly treat files encountered more than once when processing separate subtrees of the multiple inheritance hierarchy as an inheritance cycle. With this release, <code>tsconfig.json</code> files containing this edge case should work correctly without generating a warning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Handle Yarn Plug'n'Play stack overflow with <code>tsconfig.json</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3915\">#3915</a>)</p>\n<p>Previously a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file that <code>extends</code> another file in a package with an <code>exports</code> map could cause a stack overflow when Yarn's Plug'n'Play resolution was active. This edge case should work now starting with this release.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work around more issues with Deno 1.31+ (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/3917\">#3917</a>)</p>\n<p>This version of Deno broke the <code>stdin</code> and <code>stdout</code> properties on command objects for inherited streams, which matters when you run esbuild's Deno module as the entry point (i.e. when <code>import.meta.main</code> is <code>true</code>). Previously esbuild would crash in Deno 1.31+ if you ran esbuild like that. This should be fixed starting with this release.</p>\n<p>This fix was contributed by <a href=\"https://github.com/Joshix-1\"><code>@​Joshix-1</code></a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>0.23.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Allow using the <code>node:</code> import prefix with <code>es*</code> targets (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3821\">#3821</a>)</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#node-imports\"><code>node:</code> prefix on imports</a> is an alternate way to import built-in node modules. For example, <code>import fs from &quot;fs&quot;</code> can also be written <code>import fs from &quot;node:fs&quot;</code>. This only works with certain newer versions of node, so esbuild removes it when you target older versions of node such as with <code>--target=node14</code> so that your code still works. With the way esbuild's platform-specific feature compatibility table works, this was added by saying that only newer versions of node support this feature. However, that means that a target such as <code>--target=node18,es2022</code> removes the <code>node:</code> prefix because none of the <code>es*</code> targets are known to support this feature. This release adds the support for the <code>node:</code> flag to esbuild's internal compatibility table for <code>es*</code> to allow you to use compound targets like this:</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>// Original code\nimport fs from 'node:fs'\nfs.open\n<p></code></pre></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

SUMMARY\r\nIt's possible to create catalogs and schemas in Databricks with special characters, which requires to always \"escape\" them in queries. For example, if you use a hyphen in a catalog name, you must run:\r\n``` sql\r\nUSE CATALOG `my-catalog`;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR escapes the catalog and schema names in the `get_prequeries` method for the Databricks Native Connector (if they were not escaped in the `connect_args` JSON).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nUnit tests added. For manual testing:\r\n1. Create a catalog and a schema containing hyphens in Databricks.\r\n2. Connect Superset to the instance using the Databricks Native connector.\r\n3. Run a query in SQL Lab.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has
