https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/36957\r\n\r\nAs reported by @jkramer-ginkgo, we also encountered a similar issue, and I'm able to reproduce it with the steps provided. Among the suggested solutions by @jkramer-ginkgo , I think it might make more sense to get `ti` from `kwargs` instead of removing this decorator. The  root cause is that https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/db2b75c233e3e3c59ec9d0563b93ddbe733ad0bf/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L3225 cannot get `task` attribute https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/db2b75c233e3e3c59ec9d0563b93ddbe733ad0bf/airflow/sentry.py#L127. But this decorator is also used in https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/2.8.0/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L2280, so the original logic would still be needed. I also change `_schedule_downstream_tasks` arguments to be keyword-lonly so that we can ensure that we can get ti from kwargs in `enrich_error`.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Possibly, it can also replace part of the mechanism described in #31830.\r\n\r\n## TLDR\r\nSee the tests i wrote, for the demo of how it works (look at the end of the file). \r\n\r\nI want to add a decorator (for now only for classes, functions, methods etc.) that we can use for deprecations in the entire codebase (core and providers). By defining a custom function, we can have the most common information (now included in deprecation message) as separate arguments, so it's easier to parse it and use in CI, docs etc.\r\n\r\n## To do in next PRs\r\n\r\n- Possibly some changes in the documentation will be required, to describe how the developers should deprecate things and what are the options.\r\n- We can probably remove the warnings from current location (`airflow.exceptions.py`) and only keep them in `airflow.deprecation.py`, but this requires some time to migrate etc. so I am not sure how do properly do it.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\nThis is my first PR that touches the core airflow, so let me know if anything needs to be changed 😄  I also have some questions to the functionality itself:\r\n\r\n1. Are there any more arguments that we can define in the deprecation decorator? Some ideas?\r\n2. Is it a good place (deprecation module in core) to have helper functions like: `get_callable_full_path` or `validate_release_string`. We can just make them private.\r\n3. Should we define separate `provider_deprecated` decorator that will have a default category set to AirflowProviderDeprecationWarning ?\r\n4. Should we allow passing a different Adapter, so that You can alter the deprecation message or we want to enforce standardization in the whole codebase and remove that option for the end user?\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36726, https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36744, https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36763, https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/36819 this PR adds the feature of\r\nmaking source tarball that we release as an official release of\r\nthe ASF for Helm Chart into reproducible tarball. This means that\r\nanyone should be able to produce such tarball using the sources\r\nof airflow and verify that he tarball pushed to SVN by the\r\nrelease manager is built from our source repositories.\r\n\r\nWe also do the same with Helm package. It turns out that gpg signing\r\nof the package does not modify the .tgz file - it just adds .prov file\r\ncontaining checksum and signature, so we can safely re-pack the .tar.gz\r\npackage in a reproducible way, this way we have both reproduciblity and\r\nprovenance check nicely working together.\r\n\r\nThere are few changes in this PR that are related:\r\n\r\n* Bumped Helm version in our environment to use the latest one and\r\n  using the `breeze k8s setup-env` environment to run all the release\r\n  commands - this way we can be sure same helm version is used to build\r\n  the package, further making it more reproducible.\r\n\r\n* The reproducible packaging utility we have has been refeactored now -\r\n  we take \"source\" archive as parameter rather than directory and simply\r\n  repack it in reproducible way.\r\n\r\n* The tool also applies group/other ownership removal on its own,\r\n  because helm package has no option to umask the generated files.\r\n\r\n* In this change we also ignore subcharts from being exported to the source\r\n  tarball package as we shoudl not include source files from postgres in\r\n  our source package..\r\n\r\n* Both - the tarball and helm package are generated in `dist` folder similarly as\r\n  all our other packages.\r\n\r\n* Documentation for releasing the packages and verifying them is updated.\r\n\r\n* CI jobs are updated to use the new commands and generated packages are\r\n  produced as artifacts so that we can be sure the commands continue\r\n  working and produce the right output.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

pull request addresses several differences between the synchronous and asynchronous implementations of ExternalTaskSensor. The changes include:\r\n\r\n**Soft Failure Handling:**\r\n- Added soft failure handling for async implementations.\r\n- This ensures that the sensor doesn't fail the entire DAG when external tasks encounter errors.\r\n\r\n**Monitoring Multiple Tasks, Task Groups, and DAGs:**\r\n- Enhanced the async implementation to monitor multiple tasks, task groups, and DAG.\r\n\r\n**Code Organization:**\r\n- Moved database-related calls to the core hook module for better modularization.\r\n- Changed the access level of certain methods to private to discourage external usage and facilitate future breaking changes as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

I propose adopting a structured approach, potentially enforceable through the CI process, for handling deprecations in Airflow. This would involve primarily using decorators for the deprecation process. This PR serves as an introduction and first step. The whole process will probably take couple of PR's.\r\n\r\nI encourage everyone to share their thoughts and feedback on this proposal. \r\n\r\n## Genesis\r\nThe genesis of this proposal stems from my attempt to compile a comprehensive documentation of all deprecations in Airflow. The lack of a standardized process for deprecation made it challenging to track and document these changes effectively.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nCurrently, deprecation in Airflow relies mainly on the content of warning messages, making it less accessible for automated discovery. The typical process includes:\r\n\r\n- Modules: Raising a DeprecationWarning at the top, suggesting full module deprecation as indicated by the message.\r\n- Classes: Issuing a DeprecationWarning within `__init__`, detailing the deprecation. The @deprecated decorator is rarely applied to the class.\r\n- Functions/Methods: Emitting a DeprecationWarning within the function/method, with a description of the deprecation. The @deprecated decorator is more common here than in classes, but still rare.\r\n- Specific Arguments: Announcing deprecation of an argument with a DeprecationWarning and a descriptive message within the function/method.\r\n- Argument Values: For changes or deprecations in argument values (e.g., changing `schedule` from \"@once\" to \"@single\"), a DeprecationWarning is raised with a detailed message in the function/method.\r\n\r\nThe current practice of raising a DeprecationWarning in the `__init__` or a function in Airflow makes it unclear what exactly is being deprecated, whether it's the class, function, a specific argument, or a particular argument value.\r\n\r\n## Proposed solution\r\nI propose adopting a structured approach, potentially enforceable through the CI process, for handling deprecations in Airflow. This would involve primarily using decorators for the deprecation process. We could develop new decorators or utilize existing ones, similar to those in the TensorFlow [codebase](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/dec8e0b11f4f87693b67e125e67dfbc68d26c205/tensorflow/python/util/deprecation.py#L274). These could be housed in a dedicated module, such as `airflow/deprecation.py`.\r\n\r\nBy implementing our own decorators, we can standardize the information provided during deprecation, allowing us to specify details using separate keyword arguments instead of embedding everything within a message.\r\n\r\n## Demo \r\n\r\n- For modules, we would probably use the current solution.\r\n- For classes, instead of raising a Warning in init, we would decorate a class (as in change files to this PR).\r\n- For functions and methods, instead of raising a Warning in the body, we would decorate the class or method. Now, depending on the deprecated thing, we would either use @deprecated, @deprecated_args, @deprecated_arg_values etc.\r\n\r\nInstead of this:\r\n```\r\ndef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:\r\n    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\r\n    if kwargs.get(\"sleep_time\") is not None:\r\n        warnings.warn(\r\n            \"The `sleep_time` parameter is deprecated, use sleep instead.\",\r\n            AirflowProviderDeprecationWarning,\r\n            stacklevel=2,\r\n        )\r\n    if kwargs.get(\"run_type\") == \"defferable\":\r\n        warnings.warn(\r\n            \"Providing 'defferable' as `run_type` is deprecated, use `defferable=True`.\",\r\n            AirflowProviderDeprecationWarning,\r\n            stacklevel=2,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe could have:\r\n```\r\n@deprecated_args_value(old_name=\"run_type\", old_value=\"defferable\", new_name=\"defferable\", new_value=True)\r\n@deprecated_args(\"sleep_time\", new_value_name=\"sleep\")\r\ndef __init__(self, *args, **kwargs) -> None:\r\n    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Challenges\r\nI'm uncertain if we can entirely remove explicit calls to `warnings.warn`. For instance, in cases where complex logic determines if a provided argument value is deprecated, especially with complex objects or nested structures, using `warnings.warn` directly might still be the most effective method of notification. It remains to be seen if a decorator can neatly handle such scenarios. \r\n\r\nPlease share any potential drawbacks of this approach in the comments.\r\n\r\n## Future possibilities / work plan\r\n\r\nWe adopt the following steps for deprecating components in Airflow:\r\n\r\n1. Utilize decorators for deprecating entire classes, functions, and methods, as improved through discussions in this PR.\r\n2. Move all deprecation related Warnings and decorators to a separate module and extend their functionality by providing some additional arguments and formatting the Deprecation message.\r\n3. Create a documentation site listing all deprecations, which simple static analysis should adequately maintain.\r\n4. Develop additional decorators, such as `arg`, `arg_values` etc., to replace current warnings within function bodies and include these in the documentation.\r\n5. Implement a CI check to ensure decorators are consistently used for deprecation.\r\n\r\nFurther considerations for future development:\r\n\r\n- Utilizing decorators allows for automatic modification of docstrings for each entity (class, function, etc.), enabling the addition of comprehensive deprecation information (including details about deprecated arguments and argument values).\r\n- If we have specific removal timelines (i.e., versions by which components should be removed from the provider or core Airflow), we can verify their removal in the pre-release CI process.\r\n\r\nFeel free to suggest additional ideas or improvements.\r\n\r\nMentioning @potiuk , as we talked about it on the Slack.

the menu in Airflow UI is using the filter [is_menu_visible](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/master/flask_appbuilder/filters.py#L133) to display or not each menu item. Each call to `is_menu_visible` calls [has_access](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/www/security_manager.py#L124) which then call an `is_authorized_` method from the auth manager used in the environment. Most likely, all auth managers (with the exception of fab) will call an external service for every `is_authorized_` method. Today, displaying the menu call 26 times an `is_authorized_` method which can be very expensive and make the Airflow UI slower.\r\n\r\nIntroducing `get_permitted_menu_items` which is responsible of returning the menu given user permissions can replace these 26 calls to one (if the service used by the auth manager is capable of multiple authz requests in one API).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

To fix that properly, I have added a fix which does the following:\r\n1. If any tags are present in the log lines, it will sanitize it by escaping the HTML so that the UI wont render it\r\n2. If not, it will proceed as usual, which is convert it to a hyperlink\r\n\r\nAdded the following in a task of a DAG to test it:\r\n```\r\n        print(\"http://example.com\")\r\n        print(\"http://apache.org/</a><b>bad-stuff!</b>\")\r\n        print(\"back to normal\")\r\n        print(\"<b>does this work?</b>\")\r\n        print(\"<div onmouseover=\\\"alert('hi');\\\">hello</div>\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nResults look like

PR implements the termination of instances in creation when a task instance is stopped (externally marked for retry) before the instance IDs were returned. It uses the `on_kill` method to shut down EC2 instances.\r\n\r\nUse case/problem:\r\n\r\nThe `EC2CreateInstanceOperator` is often used in a setup task of https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/howto/setup-and-teardown.html . If the task inside the DAG is cancelled, a (potentially) ongoing `EC2CreateInstanceOperator` task is killed. This is likely if the AWS initialization and/or the post-processing step take considerable time (large instance storage, long cloud-init processes) and the `wait_for_completion` is `True`.\r\n\r\nWithout the `on_kill` cleanup code the partially initialized instances (i.e. the instance ids were not sent to XCom) will not be terminated by the tear-down task.\r\n\r\nThis happened several times to me and I finally found the cause and fixed it.\r\n\r\nAlternative: Split the setup into many small tasks: `EC2CreateInstance` as a setup (wo `wait_for_completion`), wait on instance state, wait on cloud-init setup to finish,  ... `EC2TerminateInstance` as teardown.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\n* Is it required to delete the `_on_kill_instance_ids` - what's coming after execute in the TI lifecycle?\r\n* How to unit-test this?\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-01-17T00:46:15Z","updated_at":"2024-01-18T19:26:37Z","closed_at":"2024-01-18T19:26:36Z","merged_at":"2024-01-18T19:26:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"d18c01a7a2f04449262606d79b4f663bdb200414","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"eladkal","id":45845474,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1ODQ1NDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45845474?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal","html_url":"https://github.com/eladkal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eladkal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"o-nikolas","id":65743084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY1NzQzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/65743084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas","html_url":"https://github.com/o-nikolas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/o-nikolas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1471852032,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDcxODUyMDMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:amazon","name":"provider:amazon","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"AWS/Amazon

building wheel providers took a lot of time (12 minutes) there was an optimisation implemented to only build the affected providers and in this case we could not run verification, because having only subset of providers would generate errors during imports.\r\n\r\nHowever, changes to make our package bulds reproducible with flit #35693 also improve building time for provider packages (all of them are built under 1 minute) and .whl installation had always been rather quick - so we can remove the optimisation now, because side effect of it that in some cases (like #36799) it caused the backwards compatibility check succeed - and subsequently continue failing in main canary build.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license

source-tarball that was supposed to be reproducible, was \"almost\" reproducible. It turned out that we forgot that group permissions are bound to change depending on the umask that is configured in the system (because using umask is the default git configuration when files are checked out). This means that the packages were reproducible only if the two people who built it had the same umask set.\r\n\r\nSince it is unlikely that default owner umask is different than rwx allowed, all the tools that are bound to provide reproducibility approach it via setting the umask to clear any permissions for group and other - this way the files in archive have only owner permissions set.\r\n\r\nThis is what this PR does - we set the tar.umask when running the `git archive` command to 0077 which effectively cleans all the group and other permissions.\r\n\r\nIn this PR we also fix FutureDeprecation warning raised in newer versions of Python where GzipFile should take keyword parameters rather than positional ones.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

For example the output Parquet files become huge, the tasks run into OOM issues and the task duration is extended.\r\n\r\nI must note that the documentation says that a large number means the worker needs more memory to execute, while on the contrary I noticed that with 1 row per row group the tasks get killed with OOM issues very quickly and with a large number everything seems fine...\r\n\r\nI changed it to 100000 based on what other Parquet writers are doing (DuckDB and Polars), but of course this number is open for debate. @Taragolis suggested a much lower value between 100 and 1000.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

a bug with beautifulsoup (missing dependency) it not failed in our CI because one because we pre-install it for some other package, [hotfix version `3.41.6` ](https://github.com/atlassian-api/atlassian-python-api/commit/450700f03bc7bd353d5e72f97a6717db98fd0717) introduce another bug with import unknown package.\r\n\r\nFor avoid any issues better to upper bound dependency until it properly fixed\r\nIn addition add `beautifulsoup` as dependency for a provider\r\n\r\nUpstream issue/PRs:\r\n-
