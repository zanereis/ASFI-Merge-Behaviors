Remove OAL and MAL generated measures' ID tag\r\n\r\nThe previous default `ID` tag is removed from measures created by OAL and MAL. `multiGet` and `metricsQuery` methods will leverage *series id* and *time bucket* to retrieve measure data.\r\n\r\n## Introduce `Banyandb.MeasureField` annotation\r\n\r\nThe new annotation marks a column as a measure field instead of a tag. Now a typical measure looks like below:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nentity:\r\n    tagNames:\r\n    - entity_id\r\n  fields:\r\n  - compressionMethod: COMPRESSION_METHOD_ZSTD\r\n    encodingMethod: ENCODING_METHOD_UNSPECIFIED\r\n    fieldType: FIELD_TYPE_STRING\r\n    name: value\r\n  - compressionMethod: COMPRESSION_METHOD_ZSTD\r\n    encodingMethod: ENCODING_METHOD_GORILLA\r\n    fieldType: FIELD_TYPE_INT\r\n    name: precision\r\n  - compressionMethod: COMPRESSION_METHOD_ZSTD\r\n    encodingMethod: ENCODING_METHOD_UNSPECIFIED\r\n    fieldType: FIELD_TYPE_STRING\r\n    name: dataset\r\n  interval: 1m\r\n  metadata:\r\n    group: measure-minute\r\n    name: service_percentile_minute\r\n  tagFamilies:\r\n  - name: default\r\n    tags:\r\n    - indexedOnly: false\r\n      name: entity_id\r\n      type: TAG_TYPE_STRING\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe measure contains a single tag named `entity_id`, which belongs to the `entity`.  No index is created. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, if we implement #10229, the `dataset` and `value` fields could get encoded.\r\n\r\n## Indexed measures remained\r\n\r\n```\r\n name: cache_access_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: cache_access_sla_minute\r\n    name: cache_read_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: cache_read_sla_minute\r\n    name: cache_write_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: cache_write_sla_minute\r\n    name: database_access_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: database_access_sla_minute\r\n    name: endpoint_relation_server_side_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: endpoint_relation_server_side_minute\r\n    name: endpoint_relation_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: endpoint_relation_sla_minute\r\n    name: endpoint_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: endpoint_sla_minute\r\n    name: mq_endpoint_consume_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: mq_endpoint_consume_sla_minute\r\n    name: mq_endpoint_produce_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: mq_endpoint_produce_sla_minute\r\n    name: mq_service_consume_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: mq_service_consume_sla_minute\r\n    name: mq_service_produce_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: mq_service_produce_sla_minute\r\n    name: process_relation_client_side_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: process_relation_client_side_minute\r\n    name: process_relation_server_side_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: process_relation_server_side_minute\r\n    name: service_instance_relation_client_call_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_instance_relation_client_call_sla_minute\r\n    name: service_instance_relation_client_side_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_instance_relation_client_side_minute\r\n    name: service_instance_relation_server_call_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_instance_relation_server_call_sla_minute\r\n    name: service_instance_relation_server_side_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_instance_relation_server_side_minute\r\n    name: service_instance_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_instance_sla_minute\r\n    name: service_relation_client_call_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_relation_client_call_sla_minute\r\n    name: service_relation_client_side_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_relation_client_side_minute\r\n    name: service_relation_server_call_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_relation_server_call_sla_minute\r\n    name: service_relation_server_side_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_relation_server_side_minute\r\n    name: service_sla_minute-index-rule-binding\r\n    name: service_sla_minute\r\n```\r\n\r\n`relation` metrics have `source` and `dest` tags that need to be indexed. \r\n\r\n`sla` metrics are from `PercentMetrics` whose `mark` column doesn't marked as `storageOnly` https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/f3b567160c/oap-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/skywalking/oap/server/core/analysis/metrics/PercentMetrics.java#L46\r\n\r\n@wu-sheng ^^ is this intended or by mistake?\r\n\r\n## Add `BanyanDB.StoreIDTag` annotation\r\n\r\nEven though we remove most `ID` tags, the process traffic still needs the `ID` tag. There is a scenario to query a process by ID. But the process id is a hashed result and can not be analyzed to a structured object. So I add this new annotation to store the id as a tag for querying.\r\n\r\n@mrproliu @wu-sheng  The banyandb also encodes `name` and `instanceId` to internal ID(SeriesID) by the xxHash algorithm. We could pass the processId to the server as the internal id. The server will skip the encoding process by storing the ingested id directly.

However when the cluster has many events (such as in large cluster\r\n  or some special Kubernetes engine like OpenShift), the requests sent from SkyWalking becomes unpredictable, i.e. SkyWalking might\r\n  send massive requests to Kubernetes API server, causing heavy load to the API server.\r\n  This PR switches from the watcher mechanism to polling mechanism, SkyWalking polls the metadata in a specified interval,\r\n  so that the requests sent to API server is predictable (~10 requests every `interval`, 3 minutes), and the requests count is constant\r\n  regardless of the cluster's changes. However with this change SkyWalking can't react to the cluster changes in time, but the delay\r\n  is acceptable in our case.\r\n* Optimize the query time of tasks in ProfileTaskCache.\r\n* Fix metrics was put into wrong slot of the window in the alerting kernel.\r\n* Support `sumPerMinLabeled` in `MAL`.\r\n* Bump up jackson databind, snakeyaml, grpc dependencies.\r\n* Support export `Trace` and `Log` through Kafka.\r\n* Add new config initialization mechanism of module provider. This is a ModuleManager lib kernel level change.\r\n* [**Breaking Change**] Support new records query protocol, rename the column named `service_id` to `entity_id` for support difference entity.\r\n  Please re-create `top_n_database_statement` index/table.\r\n* Remove improper self-obs metrics in JvmMetricsHandler(for Kafka channel).\r\n* gRPC stream canceling code is not logged as an error when the client cancels the stream. The client\r\n  cancels the stream when the pod is terminated.\r\n* [**Breaking Change**] Change the way of loading MAL rules(support pattern).\r\n* Move k8s relative MAL files into `/otel-rules/k8s`.\r\n* [**Breaking Change**] Refactor service mesh protobuf definitions and split TCP-related metrics to individual definition.\r\n* Add `TCP{Service,ServiceInstance,ServiceRelation,ServiceInstanceRelation}` sources and split TCP-related entities out from\r\n  original `Service,ServiceInstance,ServiceRelation,ServiceInstanceRelation`.\r\n* [**Breaking Change**] TCP-related source names are changed, fields of TCP-related sources are changed, please refer to the latest `oal/tcp.oal` file.\r\n* Do not log error logs when failed to create ElasticSearch index because the index is created already.\r\n* Add virtual MQ analysis for native traces.\r\n* Support Python runtime metrics analysis.\r\n* Support `sampledTrace` in LAL.\r\n* Support multiple rules with different names under the same layer of LAL script.\r\n* (Optimization) Reduce the buffer size(queue) of MAL(only) metric streams.

This caused `Can't split xxx id into 2 parts`.\r\n* Support dynamic config the sampling strategy in network profiling.\r\n* Zipkin module support BanyanDB storage.\r\n* Zipkin traces query API, sort the result set by start time by default.\r\n* Enhance the cache mechanism in the metric persistent process.\r\n  * This cache only worked when the metric is accessible(readable) from the database. Once the insert execution is delayed\r\n    due to the scale, the cache loses efficacy. It only works for the last time update per minute, considering our\r\n    25s period.\r\n  * Fix ID conflicts for all JDBC storage implementations. Due to the insert delay, the JDBC storage implementation would\r\n    still generate another new insert statement.\r\n* [**Breaking Change**] Remove `core/default/enableDatabaseSession` config.\r\n* [**Breaking Change**] Add `@BanyanDB.TimestampColumn` to identify `which column in Record` is providing the timestamp(milliseconds) for BanyanDB,\r\n  since BanyanDB stream requires a timestamp in milliseconds.\r\n  For SQL-Database: add new column `timestamp` for tables `profile_task_log/top_n_database_statement`,\r\n  requires altering this column or removing these tables before OAP starts, if bump up from previous releases.\r\n* Fix Elasticsearch storage: In `No-Sharding Mode`, add specific analyzer to the template before index creation to avoid update index error.\r\n* Internal API: remove undocumented ElasticSearch API usage and use documented one.\r\n* Fix `BanyanDB.ShardingKey` annotation missed in the generated OAL metrics classes.\r\n* Fix Elasticsearch storage: Query `sortMetrics` missing transform real index column name.\r\n* Rename `BanyanDB.ShardingKey` to `BanyanDB.SeriesID`.\r\n* Self-Observability: Add counters for metrics reading from DB or cached. Dashboard:`Metrics Persistent Cache Count`.\r\n* Self-Observability: Fix `GC Time` calculation.\r\n* Fix Elasticsearch storage: In `No-Sharding Mode`, column's property `indexOnly` not applied and cannot be updated.\r\n* Update the `trace_id` field as storage only(cannot be queried) in `top_n_database_statement`, `top_n_cache_read_command`, `top_n_cache_read_command` index.\r\n\r\n#### UI\r\n\r\n* Fix: tab active incorrectly, when click tab space\r\n* Add impala icon for impala JDBC Java agent plugin.\r\n* (Webapp)Bump up snakeyaml to 1.31 for fixing CVE-2022-25857\r\n* [Breaking Change]: migrate from Spring Web to Armeria, now you should use the environment variable\r\n  name `SW_OAP_ADDRESS`\r\n  to change the OAP backend service addresses, like `SW_OAP_ADDRESS=localhost:12800,localhost:12801`, and use\r\n  environment\r\n  variable `SW_SERVER_PORT` to change the port. Other Spring-related configurations don't take effect anymore.\r\n* Polish the endpoint list graph.\r\n* Fix styles for an adaptive height.\r\n* Fix setting up a new time range after clicking the refresh button.\r\n* Enhance the process topology graph to support dragging nodes.\r\n* UI-template: Fix metrics calculation in `general-service/mesh-service/faas-function` top-list dashboard.\r\n*
