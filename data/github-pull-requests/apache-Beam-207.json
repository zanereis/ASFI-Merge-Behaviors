PR is a second shot at #4820 based on [the work](https://github.com/andrix/python-snappy/pull/72#) that @pitrou has done to allow python-snappy to support Python memoryviews.

abstracted away PTransform translation so that timers can be translated to PCollections since the existing translation mechanism required could only modify the FunctionSpec.\r\nNote that I took this approach because changing the AppliedPTransform implementation to treat timers as an additional input and output would require updating all the non portable runners which did not seem worth the effort.\r\nOnce portability lands, we can go back and clean up several user and Runner facing interfaces which contain both user and Runner specific bindings.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes

is a small piece inspired by #5805. Before this, `BeamSortRel` rejected LIMIT on non-global windows.\r\n\r\nAs noted in #5805, it doesn't really make sense to keep the windowing strategy around on PCollections. So since the PCollections representing rels are conceptually globally windowed, it is safe for LIMIT to re-window into the global window in order to stream the desired number of rows.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

made these changes while debugging #5850; I think they should pass against `master` and I think are worthwhile on their own.\r\n\r\nThe tables that were all given the same name have been given different names to clarify scoping. The other change is at each level to explicitly group by a windowing expression again. It is a bit of cruft & boilerplate but I think technically more correct; just grouping by something that was the windowing expression for an inner query does not have the same implication of GC. In a perfect world, we might be able to grok this more deeply, but just inlining things to make it correct right now.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

is a fairly surgical fix that makes timestamps work.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all a comprehensive solution to the general problem of establishing a proper compatibility between Beam `Row` and Avatica's meta schema stuff. I suspect we can override `Cursor.getAccessors` at the right place to avoid conversion at all. Since there's no meaningful documentation, it will take a minute to figure that out.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

turns on spotless Java universally and applies it to all the Java code.\r\n\r\nWhen I did it just for the SQL module, one thing that came up was when the license header had a javadoc comments (started

So I did a search for that and fix the last two cases.\r\n\r\nThen I just ran `./gradlew spotlessJava`.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.
