Fixed Ids cannot be\r\n  unregistered and attempting to re-register a fixed Id will result in\r\n  an exception on startup.\r\n- In order to implement this SPI one needs to provide a service loader\r\n  file -\r\n  resources/META-INF/services/org.apache.geode.internal.serialization.DataSerializableFixedIdRegistrant.\r\n  This file should contain the fully qualified name of a class which\r\n  implements DataSerializableFixedIdRegistrant. Examples can be seen in\r\n  the WAN, Lucene and Redis modules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- In order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken: \r\n-->\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

all uses of `JUnitParamsRunner` to use a new runner that can be\nmade compatible with JUnit 5.\n\nPROBLEM\n\nWe want to upgrade Geode to use JUnit 5. JUnit 5 includes a test engine\ncalled JUnit Vintage, which it uses to run JUnit 4 tests. JUnit Vintage\ninteracts with test runners differently than JUnit 4 did.\n\n`JUnitParamsRunner` is incompatible with JUnit Vintage in several ways:\n- When `JUnitParamsRunner` describes parameterized tests, it discards\n  the `@Category` annotation that JUnit Vintage uses to filter tests by\n  category.\n- When JUnit Vintage asks `JUnitParamsRunner` to filter tests by name,\n  the runner fails to apply the filter to parameterized tests.\n\nThe net result is that when JUnit Vintage tries to filter tests by\ncategory, `JUnitParamsRunner` runs every parameterized test, including\ntests that lack the category. This affects the Windows Gfsh distributed\ntest job in particular, causing it to run 900 tests instead of the\ndesired 200. Numerous of the extra 700 tests fail on Windows.\n\nThis problem prevents us from upgrading to JUnit 5.\n\n`JUnitParamsRunner` is no longer maintained. It will not be made\ncompatible with JUnit Vintage.\n\nApproximately 140 test classes use `JUnitParamsRunner`. To upgrade to\nJUnit 5, we will have to migrate all of these tests to use a runner\ncompatible with JUnit Vintage.\n\nSOLUTION\n\nThe solution involves two steps:\n1. Migrate every existing use of `JUnitParamsRunner` to instead use a\n   new `GeodeParamsRunner` that behaves identically to\n   `JUnitParamsRunner`.\n2. Upgrade Geode to use JUnit 5.\n\nThis PR implements step 1. This PR implements a \"dummy\" version of\n`GeodeParamsRunner` that behaves identically to `JUnitParamsRunner`. Its\nonly purpose is to allow migrating approximately 140 test classes to use\nthe new runner name.\n\nI will implement step 2 in a later PR. This will include re-implementing\n`GeodeParamsRunner` to be compatible with JUnit 5. (I have verified the\nviability of this via a spike.)\n\nSeparating the \"migrate the tests\" and \"upgrade JUnit\" steps into\nseparate PRs makes each PR much more focused and much easier to review.\n","created_at":"2021-09-22T17:46:26Z","updated_at":"2021-09-24T16:38:39Z","closed_at":"2021-09-24T16:38:34Z","merged_at":"2021-09-24T16:38:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d6eef3511926d2a235b6c34577c7b3c0417ecd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"agingade","id":8432880,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzI4ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8432880?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade","html_url":"https://github.com/agingade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/agingade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"BenjaminPerryRoss","id":39068135,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDY4MTM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/39068135?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss","html_url":"https://github.com/BenjaminPerryRoss","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BenjaminPerryRoss/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Bill","id":4002,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4002?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill","html_url":"https://github.com/Bill","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Bill/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"boglesby","id":1002028,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIwMjg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002028?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby","html_url":"https://github.com/boglesby","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/boglesby/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jdeppe-pivotal","id":5313410,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMTM0MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5313410?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/jdeppe-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jdeppe-pivotal/received_events","type":

(*)\r\n|    +--- <snip>\r\n|    +--- project :geode-cq\r\n|    |    +--- <snip>\r\n|    |    +--- project :geode-core (*)\r\n|    +--- project :geode-log4j\r\n|    |    +--- <snip>\r\n|    |    +--- project :geode-core (*)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+--- project :geode-deployment:geode-deployment-legacy\r\n|    +--- <snip>\r\n|    +--- project :geode-core (*)\r\n```\r\nThe fix involves excluding `geode-core` from the above identified integrationTestImplementation dependencies:\r\n```\r\n    integrationTestImplementation(project(':geode-gfsh')) {\r\n        exclude module: 'geode-core'\r\n    }\r\n    integrationTestImplementation(project(':geode-junit')) {\r\n        exclude module: 'geode-core'\r\n    }\r\n    integrationTestImplementation(project(':geode-dunit')) {\r\n        exclude module: 'geode-core'\r\n    }\r\n    integrationTestImplementation(project(':geode-log4j')) {\r\n        exclude module: 'geode-core'\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis PR fixes the circular dependencies that add geode-*module*.jars to the classpath of tests in modules:\r\n- geode-core\r\n- geode-cq\r\n- geode-gfsh\r\n- geode-maangement\r\n- geode-wan\r\n-

PR contains a modification of the original implementation of the `WanCopyRegionFunction` function in which a new thread is not created in each function invocation.\r\nIn order to cancel ongoing

when group-transaction-events is true (#6663)\"\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit b377e3f808562fdf59d2753a5a58fd9b9d603883.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've reviewed the code that went in with #b377e3, and I think we should revert it to rework WanCopyRegionFunction and its unit test. The unit test currently mocks three methods in WanCopyRegionFunction (known as partial mocking) which is a sign that dependencies are hidden inside the class and need to be pulled up to the constructor.\r\n\r\nWanCopyRegionFunction also has a static final ExecutorService which is never shutdown. The ExecutorService should live outside WanCopyRegionFunction, be passed in via the constructor, and be shutdown when the Cache closes.\r\n\r\nThe intermittent test failures are not specific to Windows and are likely to also fail on a slow Linux machine.\r\n\r\nWe really need to avoid Thread sleeps especially in unit tests. This and the partial mocking are signs that the class needs to change to better enable unit testing.\r\n\r\nI'll be more than happy to help but I think we need to revert it so we have time to discuss it without everyone else being affected by failing

following reasons:\r\n1. there is no clean way to get access to it unless using the static variable in `ServerConnection`\r\n2. when a clients connects, multiple threads calls into the server to authenticate, resulting into multiple in that entries in that map, each with different unique id and unique subject/principal, even though it's the same user. Logging out one subject nulls one but didn't null the others. The other subject in the map won't be able to do anything anyway because every attempted operation will logout the user.\r\n3.

the test case that cancels all ongoing executions of the wan-copy command, it seems that it takes longer than 100ms to start the two command executions so, when the cancel is executed later, the executions are not yet started.\r\nA longer sleep time to wait for the wan-copy commands to be started has been added.\r\n\r\nSee the test failure on windows here:\r\nhttps://concourse.apachegeode-ci.info/teams/main/pipelines/apache-develop-main/jobs/windows-unit-test-openjdk11/builds/143\r\n\r\nAlso, while fixing of the above problem, the test case was found to also fail sometimes with the following error:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.geode.management.internal.cli.functions.WanCopyRegionFunctionTest > executeWanCopyRegionFunctionInNewThread_cancelAllExecutions FAILED\r\n    org.mockito.exceptions.misusing.UnfinishedStubbingException: \r\n    Unfinished stubbing detected here:\r\n    -> at org.apache.geode.management.internal.cli.functions.WanCopyRegionFunctionTest.executeAsyncWanCopyRegionFunction(WanCopyRegionFunctionTest.java:670)\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe above failure also been taken care of in this PR by not using twice the `dispatcherMock` member in the test case.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the
