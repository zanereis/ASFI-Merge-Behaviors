https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/12329\r\n\r\nA check for autodetect being falsey instead of it being None stops us from being able to use a feature from the [Job API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/Job) where a BQ table exists and we don't want to specify schema_fields or a schema_obj. Change this check to look for explicit False thus allowing us to be able to pass None to autodetect without schema_fields or a schema_obj.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing Notes\r\n\r\nTo verify, I tried this on my local setup with a simple dag:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\n\r\nfrom etsy.operators.gcs_to_bigquery import GCSToBigQueryOperator\r\n\r\nDEFAULT_TASK_ARGS = {\r\n    \"owner\": \"gcp-data-platform\",\r\n    \"retries\": 1,\r\n    \"retry_delay\": 10,\r\n    \"start_date\": \"2022-08-01\",\r\n}\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    max_active_runs=1,\r\n    concurrency=2,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    schedule_interval=\"@daily\",\r\n    dag_id=\"test_os_patch_gcs_to_bigquery\",\r\n    default_args=DEFAULT_TASK_ARGS,\r\n) as dag:\r\n\r\n    test_gcs_to_bigquery = GCSToBigQueryOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"test_gcs_to_bigquery\",\r\n        create_disposition=\"CREATE_IF_NEEDED\",\r\n        # Need to explicitly set autodetect to None\r\n        autodetect=None,\r\n        write_disposition=\"WRITE_TRUNCATE\",\r\n        destination_project_dataset_table=\"my-project.vchiapaikeo.test1\",\r\n        bucket=\"my-bucket\",\r\n        source_format=\"CSV\",\r\n        source_objects=[\"vchiapaikeo/file.csv\"],\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nI then created a simple table in BigQuery:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"552\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9200263/209403766-fe31c8ca-77e5-49dd-a970-28306cba9d05.png\">\r\n\r\nAnd ran the dag:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9200263/209404262-18a46b04-8ec2-4bb1-9e9f-203ecc63876b.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"583\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9200263/209403806-fc9f09df-2ce2-45de-a44b-b746c3b8ac39.png\">\r\n\r\nTask logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1087} INFO - Dependencies all met for <TaskInstance: test_os_patch_gcs_to_bigquery.test_gcs_to_bigquery scheduled__2022-12-22T00:00:00+00:00 [queued]>\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1087} INFO - Dependencies all met for <TaskInstance: test_os_patch_gcs_to_bigquery.test_gcs_to_bigquery scheduled__2022-12-22T00:00:00+00:00 [queued]>\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1283} INFO - \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1284} INFO - Starting attempt 15 of 16\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1285} INFO - \r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1304} INFO - Executing <Task(GCSToBigQueryOperator): test_gcs_to_bigquery> on 2022-12-22 00:00:00+00:00\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:55} INFO - Started process 5611 to run task\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:82} INFO - Running: ['airflow', 'tasks', 'run', 'test_os_patch_gcs_to_bigquery', 'test_gcs_to_bigquery', 'scheduled__2022-12-22T00:00:00+00:00', '--job-id', '17', '--raw', '--subdir', 'DAGS_FOLDER/dataeng/batch/test_os_patch_gcs_to_bigquery.py', '--cfg-path', '/tmp/tmpoxitwl1m']\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {standard_task_runner.py:83} INFO - Job 17: Subtask test_gcs_to_bigquery\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {task_command.py:389} INFO - Running <TaskInstance: test_os_patch_gcs_to_bigquery.test_gcs_to_bigquery scheduled__2022-12-22T00:00:00+00:00 [running]> on host f3b7042f4dc5\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1511} INFO - Exporting the following env vars:\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_OWNER=gcp-data-platform\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_ID=test_os_patch_gcs_to_bigquery\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_TASK_ID=test_gcs_to_bigquery\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_EXECUTION_DATE=2022-12-22T00:00:00+00:00\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_TRY_NUMBER=15\r\nAIRFLOW_CTX_DAG_RUN_ID=scheduled__2022-12-22T00:00:00+00:00\r\n[2022-12-23, 20:30:32 UTC] {metastore.py:45} INFO - Default connection request.

it was only possible to set \"policy\" functions via\r\nairflow_local_settings.py which is fine for \"small clusters\" but being\r\nable to control some of these policies from installed\r\nplugins/distributions is helpful in a few circumstances: it lets\r\n\"platforms\" (either of the SaaS variety, or internal platform teams)\r\nspecify some common policies, but still let local Ariflow teams define\r\nother policies using airflow_local_settings\r\n\r\nThis uses Pluggy[[1]] for plugin management (that we are already using\r\nfor the listener interface), and out of the box that\r\ngives us the ability to have multiple implementations of the policy\r\nfunctions where it makes sense\r\n\r\n- on all the \"mutation\" hooks all implementations will be called. (i.e.\r\n  for the policies that don't return a value)\r\n- for any policy function that returns a value (such as\r\n  `get_dagbag_import_timeout`) then the plugins will be tried in LIFO\r\n  order until a non-None value is returned. (No code needed for us --\r\n  Pluggy handles this out of the box with the `firstresult=True`\r\n  property on the hookspec decorator).\r\n\r\n[1]: https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html\r\n\r\n\r\nTodo:\r\n\r\n- [x] Document the way of adding plugins (setuptools entrypoints) and mark it experimental\r\n- [x] Document how multiple plugins hooking the same function interact.\r\n- [x] Mention that the argument names must match \r\n- [x] Issue deprecation warning when arg names don't match\r\n- [ ]

provider validation pre-commit is now a lot slower after #28516 but it turned out that it has been also doing a little too much.\r\n\r\nIt worked in the way (against the original design) that when any provider.yaml changed, validation was actually performed for all the providers, not only for those changed.\r\n\r\nThis change improves the regular speed of running this validation when one or few providers are changed in the commit.\r\n\r\nIt's not only limiting the validation to those provider.yaml files that changes but also performing subset of validations on those changed files if not all providers are changed or --all-files are not used (because some of the validations involving documentation and cross-provider dependencies require all provider.yaml files to be loaded and validated).\r\n\r\nThe validation is still done in one \"docker run\" command though.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

behavior of the Debug Executor with sensors:\r\n- When the sensor code gets executed the (copy of the) task is in \"reschedule\" mode, so the sensor releases it and reschedules it `now + poke_interval` in the future\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/13b43a775c17ca8767461172ae76abdfa779dc7d/airflow/sensors/base.py#L263-L265\r\n- The original task object stays in \"poke\" mode, so when the rescheduling event is received, it isn't handled properly, and the task is rescheduled for immediate execution (instead of rescheduling it int the future). This is taking place here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/681835a67c89784944f41fce86099bcb2c3a0614/airflow/ti_deps/deps/ready_to_reschedule.py#L47-L52\r\n\r\nBecause of this, the `poke` method is effectively called in a tight loop, hammering whichever API it's querying, eventually leading to trouble such as rate-limiting if the sensor waits long enough, which hampers debugging, the initial purpose of this executor.\r\n\r\nIn this change, I propose that we add a special case for the debug executor in the `ready_to_reschedule` file to always reschedule when running with the debug executor.\r\n\r\nWhile testing this change, I noticed that the Executor itself also spins in a tight loop when it has no task to execute, leading to unnecessary resource usage and huge log files. With limited knowledge of how executors work, I'm proposing a poor man's fix for this here as well, where the executor would sleep for 500ms if there are no task ready to be executed.\r\nI think this time is short enough that humans won't have to wait too long for their tasks to be picked up when ready, and also long enough that the amount of logs is manageable and can be reasonably

entrypoint exposes _PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS to allow installing packages. While it is clearly stated that this option should only be used in tests it is still common to make multiple attempts. Thus requiring to install multiple packages multiple times.\r\n\r\nTo improve the installation speeds in such a scenario a practical solution is to use a pypi cache. A simple example is with running [epicwink/proxpi](https://github.com/EpicWink/proxpi). To enable the usage one will need to specify the relevant pip install flags.\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install --index-url http://127.0.0.1:5000/index/ simplejson\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr when using a different ip (e.g a host in the local network)\r\n\r\n```\r\npip install \\\r\n        --trusted-host 172.31.234.147 \\\r\n        --index-url http://172.31.234.147:5000/index/ \\\r\n        simplejson\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo do this we reuse the existing flag ADDITIONAL_PIP_INSTALL_FLAGS and pass it to the relevant place.\r\n\r\n**Note**: for any users interested in using a proxy without this patch you can simply pass the extra options in the `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS ` variable.\r\nExample: `_PIP_ADDITIONAL_REQUIREMENTS=\"--trusted-host 172.31.234.147 --index-url

provider validation only checked if classes and packages were belonging to the right package, but they did not check if the classes or packages specified could actually be imported - which could lead to webserver crash as in case of #28393.\r\n\r\nThat requires the pre-commit code to be moved to the Breeze container, because only there we have all the packages installed that are needed to import the packages and classes.\r\n\r\nWe have to also make an exclusion for MSSQL and MySQL classes because they are missing for ARM images, so on ARM import errors for those are expected.\r\n\r\nFixes:

selective check was implemented in the way that it printed diagnostic output on stdout and the GITHUB_OUTPUT compatible set of outputs on stderr so that it could be redirected to the GITHUB_OUTPUT in its entirety. But this turned out to be a bad idea because when there was an error generated in selective-checks themselves, the traceback was printed in stderr and redirecting stderr to GITHUB_OUTPUT swallowed the traceback.\r\n\r\nThis change reverses the behaviour:\r\n\r\n* diagnostic output is printed to stderr\r\n* GITHUB_OUTPUT compatible output is printed to stdout\r\n\r\nThis way when traceback happens it is printed to stderr and is not swalleowed by redirection to GITHUB_OUTPUT\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

an optional dependency (with \"[pandas]\" extra).\r\n\r\nThis is not a breaking change, since those who already installed previous provider version have pandas installed already.

Airflow start without airflow.cfg, the default configuration file is generated and so far it contained all the defaults.\r\n\r\nHowever, this caused some problems - the configuration values modified by the users were not easily distinguishable from those from default values.\r\n\r\nWhile having comments, sections and descriptions in the generated config file was useful, having the values there was problematic, mainly when defaults have cahnged or when configuration sections or keys were renamed - because we could not easily change defaults for those users who already had their config file generated.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the approach for defaults:\r\n\r\n* instead of reading defaults from the config file, we read the defaults from internal python dictionary (generated from the config yaml single-source-of truth\r\n\r\n* the config file when missing is still generated, but all values in there are commented out. This has the nice effect that you can still use just the config file to know what configuration options you have, and easiky change them (by just uncommenting and changing value) - but the \"default\" value is now really part of the airflow application not the generated configuration file\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

jobs that are running longer than ~500 seconds.\r\nMoved those values into default arguments of the `add_job_flow_steps()` function which won't change default behaviour but will add some flexibility for use cases with longer emr steps.\r\n\r\nAlso considered option to pass whole config dict instead of `waiter_delay` and `waiter_max_attempts`, but these changes are

used to pickle raw pods objects but found that when unpickling across k8s lib versions we would get missing attr errors.  \r\n\r\nNow, we serialize to json.\r\n\r\nBut we still get reports of issues when people upgrade because it only solves the issue on a go-forward basis.\r\n\r\nBut we can fix these old bad executor configs that keep popping up by roundtripping the pod to json in a more

you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #28441\r\nrelated: #28441\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nGCSToBigQueryOperator allows multiple ways to specify schema of the BigQuery table:\r\n\r\n1. Setting autodetect == True\r\n1. Setting schema_fields directly with autodetect == False\r\n1. Setting a schema_object and optionally a schema_object_bucket with autodetect == False\r\n\r\nThis third method seems to be broken in the latest provider version (8.6.0) and will always result in this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2022-12-16, 21:06:18 UTC] {taskinstance.py:1772} ERROR - Task failed with exception\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/airflow/providers/google/cloud/transfers/gcs_to_bigquery.py\", line 395, in execute\r\n    self.configuration = self._check_schema_fields(self.configuration)\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/airflow/providers/google/cloud/transfers/gcs_to_bigquery.py\", line 524, in _check_schema_fields\r\n    raise RuntimeError(\r\nRuntimeError: Table schema was not found. Set autodetect=True to automatically set schema fields from source objects or pass schema_fields explicitly\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is because [this block](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/25bdbc8e6768712bad6043618242eec9c6632618/airflow/providers/google/cloud/transfers/gcs_to_bigquery.py#L318-L320) where `if self.schema_object and self.source_format != \"DATASTORE_BACKUP\":` fails to set self.schema_fields. It only sets the local variable, schema_fields. When self._check_schema_fields is subsequently called [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/25bdbc8e6768712bad6043618242eec9c6632618/airflow/providers/google/cloud/transfers/gcs_to_bigquery.py#L395), we enter the [first block](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/25bdbc8e6768712bad6043618242eec9c6632618/airflow/providers/google/cloud/transfers/gcs_to_bigquery.py#L523-L528) because autodetect is false and self.schema_fields is not set.\r\n\r\nThis PR sets the instance variable, self.schema_fields when the user passes in a schema_obj. Additionally, it uses self.schema_object_bucket instead of the erroneous self.bucket.\r\n\r\ncc: @eladkal\r\nFixes:

live logging (viewing from webserver while task running) for k8s executor pods doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThe cause has a few components from things we do during task run:\r\n1. we remove the console handler from root logger.  So any logs that make it to root don't get emitted.\r\n2. even if we keep console handler at root, it is designed to respect stdout redirection\r\n3. even if we make it not respect stdout redirection in this context, task logger does not propagate, so anything going through task logger does not make it to root logger\r\n\r\nThe reason for (3) is we *copy* the task handler to root logger instead of *move*, which requires that we disable propagation at the task logger.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes all of these things and, ultimately, simplifies the setup.\r\n\r\n1. instead of keeping task handler in two places during execution -- airflow.task and root -- we keep it just in root.  This means we can let airflow.task logger propagate. this we now do always.\r\n2. when running k8s executor pod, we keep the console handler at root and set it to not respect redirection, so that even though stdout gets redirected to task logger, when it makes it to root logger, it is still emitted to stdout.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-18T08:52:26Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T23:32:17Z","closed_at":"2023-01-09T20:27:45Z","merged_at":"2023-01-09T20:27:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"3ececb2c79307bd943aad116d7b0b5933af8185a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":

in case of ARM processor lacks support for several components (because they do not have supported ARM binaries available):\r\n\r\n* MySQL\r\n* MSSQL\r\n* LevelDB\r\n* Azure Service Bus\r\n\r\nWhen you try to attempt to run pytest on a group of tests that import one of those, the collection failed and none of the tests could run even if some of them could.\r\n\r\nThis change uses pytest's skip on a module level and local imports in case the tests are inter-mixed with other tests in the same module to avoid import errors during collection.\r\n\r\nThe try/except pattern over pytest.importorskip is preferred because we are using try/except in a number of other cases and we are pretty familiar with similar pattern and importorskipi has a bit unexpected behaviour (it returns imported module and you do not see the usual `import nnnn`. Also in our case we often wrap more than one import in one try/except (and it would lead to a duplicating messages to print really.\r\n\r\nWe also add a separate command in ci to just perform a collection of tests and see if all tests are collectable after uninstalling all those libraries. This would prevent the problems from reapparing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.
