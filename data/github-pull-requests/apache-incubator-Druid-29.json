Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you run the two queries like below:\r\n```sql\r\n1. insert into mytest select time_parse(ts) as __time, c1 from (values('2022-01-01 00:00:00', 'A')) as t(ts, c1) partitioned by MONTH\r\n\r\n2. insert into mytest select time_parse(ts) as __time, c1 from (values('2022-01-02 00:00:00', 'A')) as t(ts, c1) partitioned by DAY\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second one allocates a segment with MONTH granularity, even though the partitioning has stated DAY granularity. \r\n\r\nThis is because the overlord does a best-effort job of fetching the segment with the requested granularity and in case a pre-existing segment is there that overlaps the requested segment, the overlord returns that segment (which might not match the requested granularity).\r\n\r\nThis is semantically incorrect since the user has requested a segment of DAY granularity and this should return an error instead. This PR adds the desired checks to prevent the described case from happening.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n#### Release notes\r\nA regression has been fixed in MSQ which can cause INSERT to allocate segments of incorrect granularity in case pre-existing segments of coarser granularity are present. Such cases now fail with the `InsertCannotAllocateSegment` fault with an appropriate actionable error message.\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Druid is using Guava `16.0.1` version. This upgrade to `31.1-jre` fixes following issues.\r\n\r\n- CVE-2018-10237 (Unbounded memory allocation in Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1 allows remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks against servers that depend on this library and deserialize attacker-provided data, because the AtomicDoubleArray class (when serialized with Java serialization) and the CompoundOrdering class (when serialized with GWT serialization) perform eager allocation without appropriate checks on what a client has sent and whether the data size is reasonable). We don't use Java or GWT serializations.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

ORDER BY `created_date`  and scan 50% task table due current index.  We should create additional index on the task table to speed up this api. \r\nThis PR will create the additional index on task table with retry if not already created. Added the test cases and log to make sure that index creation never fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

Description\r\n\r\nThe logs from `HttpServerInventoryView` and the underlying `ChangeRequestHttpSyncer` are often too cryptic and the metrics are insufficient.\r\n\r\n### Bug\r\n__Description:__ If a server is removed during `HttpServerInventoryView.serverInventoryInitialized`, the initialization gets stuck as this server is never synced. The method eventually times out (default 250s).\r\n__Fix:__ Mark a server as stopped if it is removed. `serverInventoryInitialized` only waits for non-stopped servers to sync.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n- Add a new single-threaded monitoring executor in `HttpServerInventoryView` to emit metrics and reset unhealthy servers. Before this PR, server reset used to happen on the same executor which is used for syncing with servers.\r\n- Add new metrics\r\n  - `segment/serverview/sync/healthy`: A 1-0 metric that denotes if the server view is syncing properly with a server\r\n  - `segment/serverview/sync/unstableTime`: tracks the time in millis for which sync with a server has been unstable\r\n- Improve logging in `HttpServerInventoryView` and `ChangeRequestHttpSyncer`\r\n- Refactor for readability\r\n- Add some static utility methods in `DateTimes` to compute elapsed time.\r\n\r\n### Pending\r\n- unit tests\r\n- cluster testing\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR fixes an issue with the `VARIANCE` and related SQL aggregation functions, allowing them to accept variance aggregator objects as inputs (currently the SQL function only accepts numeric operands).\r\n\r\nThe new `SqlAggFunction` definitions are the same as `SqlAvgAggFunction` from `SqlStdOperatorTable` but with the operand type broadened to include variance aggregator objects in addition to numerics.\r\n\r\nNote: This pulls in the `RowSignatures.complexTypeChecker` changes from https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14195 for tighter operand type checking\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

#10702\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR revives https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10949 which address issue #10702 by adding support for doubleLast, doubleFirst, FloatLast, FloatFirst, longLast and longFirst.\r\n\r\nWe now support Numeric Last/First data types while ingestion and native query (for MSQ as well)\r\n#### Ingestion\r\n- using spec we do support aggregation behavior for Double/Float and Long last/first column types.\r\n- this is still pending change on the UI to be supported ([reverted PR](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/10794/files)) which will be taken part as a follow-up PR\r\n\r\n#### Query\r\n- Querying this data type is not yet supported in SQL as we do require some calcite changes (tobe done in a follow-up PR)\r\n- We can use native json spec query to obtain teh numeric Last and first value from the ingested column\r\nusage:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      \"type\": \"doubleLast\",\r\n      \"name\": \"a3\",\r\n      \"fieldName\": \"last_double_added\", // while ingesting this column is of type DoubleLast\r\n      \"timeColumn\": \"__time\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* `AbstractSerializableLongObjectPairSerde` abstract class to share serde between double/float/long\r\n* `AbstractSerializablePairLongObjectBufferStore.java`\r\n* `AbstractSerializablePairLongObjectColumnHeader.java`\r\n* `AbstractSerializablePairLongObjectColumnSerializer.java`\r\n* `AbstractSerializablePairLongObjectDeltaEncodedStagedSerde.java`\r\n* `AbstractSerializablePairLongObjectSimpleStagedSerde.java`\r\n* `SerializablePairLongDoubleComplexMetricSerde` for double\r\n* `SerializablePairLongFloatComplexMetricSerde` for float\r\n* `SerializablePairLongStringComplexMetricSerde` for long\r\n* `GenericFirstAggregateCombiner` first  agg combiner to share between double/float/long\r\n* `GenericLastAggregateCombiner` first  agg combiner to share between double/float/long\r\n* `DoubleFirstAggregatorFactory`, `DoubleLastAggregatorFactory`\r\n* `FloatFirstAggregatorFactory`, `FloatLastAggregatorFactory`\r\n* `LongFirstAggregatorFactory`, `LongLastAggregatorFactory`\r\n\r\nFurther introduces new `ColumnType` \r\n * serializablePairLongDouble\r\n * serializablePairLongFloat\r\n * serializablePairLongString\r\n\r\nPost suggestions, we are no longer using `GenericIndexed`. Using the pattern defined in `SerializablePairLongStringComplexMetricSerde` we observed an improvement of 40% in terms of storage (These number are against ingestion of 1 days worth of wikiticker data)\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-Do\r\nThese will be taken up in a follow-up PR \r\n- Add ingestion support from UI for first/last types\r\n- SQL compatibility for querying (latest/earliest) the new ingestion type (Today this is queryable via native json queries not via sql. Needs more discussion on making this SQL compatible)\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

fixes #14374. The first expression will currently throw a class cast exception because it is trying to cast `ARRAY<STRING>` to `STRING` because it seems that by default the query plans to 'RETURNING VARCHAR' instead of using JSON_VALUE_ANY, will work on resolving that in a different PR.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe `JSON_VALUE` expression (e.g. when not using the specialized `NestedFieldVirtualColumn`) was using a stale method that predated support for returning arrays, which would always return null if the value was an object or an array. This method has been removed so that the `JSON_VALUE` expression now matches the behavior of `JSON_VALUE` using `NestedFieldVirtualColumn`.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests

I have changed this to include segments from the Realtime nodes as well. So that the replica count of the segment, which just got handoff to historical nodes, becomes non-zero. And these segment does not get included in the unavailable segment count metrics.  \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

Description\r\nThis PR consolidates 'json' and 'auto' column indexers, bring all the improvements of 'auto' to 'json'. 'auto' is the next generation (v5) of 'json' (v4) nested column format. However, 'json' was kept separate and on the previous version of the format for backwards compatibility during rolling upgrades from 25 to 26. Basically this allows us to dump a bunch of code, leaving only the v4 reader so that we can continue to read the older columns.\r\n\r\nI will open a separate PR to handle future backwards compatibility concerns in order to degrade gracefully when new column format features are added to make what we had to do here less important.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n'json' is now equivalent to using 'auto' in native ingestion dimension specs, upgrading 'json' to get all of the features and functionality of 'auto', such as type specializations including ARRAY typed columns, better support for nested arrays and smarter index utilization. However, this means that 'json' columns created with Druid 28 are not backwards compatible with Druid versions older than 26, so it is recommended to upgrade to Druid 26 prior to upgrading to Druid 28 if upgrading from an older version and using 'json' columns. Additionally, to downgrade to a version older than Druid 26, any new segments created in Druid 28 should be re-ingested using Druid 26 or 27 prior to further downgrading.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nSort merge join plans the join queries in a different way where both the sides of the joins are subquery. This introduces a regression in planning when the condition for the join becomes an input ref to a boolean column indicating whether or not that row needs to be included or not. This PR fixes the following things:\r\n1. Planning of such sub-conditions\r\n2. Changing the semantics of joinAlgorithm to be a directive rather than a \"command\" - SortMerge join helps in a subset of the join cases, where the left and the right side are columns into the tables. Left expressions, right expressions, and expressions where we only rely on a boolean input ref (like above) don't fit into this use case. One problem with the above condition would be that we would only have 2 partitions while partitioning the table (\"true\"/\"false\") which would degrade the performance of sort-merge join. Therefore MSQ's DataSourcePlan would determine whether or not to accept the hint based on the sub condition (for now). \r\n\r\nThe 2) point should ideally reside in the planner, however till the time we have a clean way to do so, we will do it in the MSQ's planner (QueryKit)   \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Changes:\r\n- Remove deprecated `DruidException` (old one) and `EntryExistsException`\r\n- Use newly added comprehensive `DruidException` instead\r\n- Update error message in `SqlMetadataStorageActionHandler` when max packet limit is violated.\r\n- Factor out common code from several faults into `BaseFault`.\r\n- Slightly update javadoc in `DruidException` to render it correctly\r\n- Remove unused classes `SegmentToMove`, `SegmentToDrop`\r\n- Move `ServletResourceUtils` from module `druid-processing` to `druid-server` and add utility method to build error Response from `DruidException`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Release Notes\r\nThe old `EntryExistsException` thrown when trying to insert a duplicate task in the metadata store has been removed. Instead, Druid now throws a `DruidException` with error code `entryAlreadyExists`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR makes some changes to the MSQ auto cleaner to add support for a \"query results\" directory in durable storage. This change will allow us to store query results as well on durable storage in the future.\r\n\r\nThe new structure of durable storage now contains a new special directory\r\n- `query-results/<controller_id>/<file>`: This will contain query results in the future. Files in this directory would be cleaned by the auto cleaner once the task `controller_id` has been dropped from the list of known tasks.\r\n\r\nThis should not break backward compatibility as the structure is the same as before, with an additional directory. An earlier version of overlord should simply delete the new query results directory as well.\r\n \r\nTested out the changes are working with an S3StorageConnector. Query directories for task Ids which were returned by knownTasks were not deleted. Other files were deleted as before.\r\n\r\nRelease notes:\r\n- Adds support for automatic cleaning of a \"query-results\" directory in durable storage. This directory will be cleaned up only if the task id is not known to the overlord. This will allow storage of query results after the task has finished running.\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things. Not all of these items apply to every PR.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\nThere are cases that no leader for Overlord/Coordinator and cases that multiple leaders selected, this could happen when service is over loaded or network partition happened.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a general heartbeat metric to indicate service health. For Overlord/Coordinator,  the sum of  `druid/heartbeat` metric with `leader=1` dimension should always be one in a heathy Druid cluster.\r\nThe new metric example for Coordinator:\r\n`{\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"leader\":1,\"metric\":\"druid/heartbeat\",\"service\":\"coordinator\",\"host\":\"localhost:8081\",\"version\":\"\",\"value\":1,\"timestamp\":\"2023-06-21T21:55:53.216Z\"}`\r\nFor Overlord:\r\n`{\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"leader\":1,\"metric\":\"druid/heartbeat\",\"service\":\"overlord\",\"host\":\"localhost:8090\",\"version\":\"\",\"value\":1,\"timestamp\":\"2023-06-21T21:34:01.764Z\"}`\r\n\r\nOther service need to provide following supplier to report `druid/heartbeat` metric:\r\n```\r\n@Named(\"heartbeat\")\r\nSupplier<Map<String, Object>> heartbeatTagsSupplier\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\nAdd a new Monitor to monitor the health of Overlord and Coordinator service.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * add `ServiceStatusMonitor`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR makes a few improvements to the `EXPLAIN PLAN` attributes structure:\r\n- Use the already computed targetDatasource and partitioned by  information extracted from the `SqlNode`\r\n- For the clustered by columns, the output names are derived and resolved from the clustered by `SqlNodeList` and the select `SqlNode`. Also, see the corresponding unit tests\r\n- Return a json array instead of comma-delimited string for `clusteredBy`\r\n- Updated docs with an `INSERT` example query and result. Also, added collapsible html tags for the sql query and json result, so the examples don't clutter and distract a reader\r\n\r\nThese change also make it consistent with rest of the fields in `EXPLAIN PLAN` result.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ExplainAttributes.java`\r\n * `DruidSqlParserUtils.java`\r\n * `ExplainAttributesTest.java`\r\n * `DruidSqlParserUtilsTest.java`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes issues that can happen during ingestion of 'auto' typed columns which receive input with mixed type arrays; Druid ARRAY types only support all elements of the same type. The ARRAY \"best effort\" code has been modified to use the \"least restrictive\" logic that is now also used by default for the computed SQL schema, allowing things like `[[\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"], {\"x\": 123}]` to now be handled as `ARRAY<COMPLEX<json>>` rather than throwing an incompatible type exception.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

this change, queries will successfully plan if any `CLUSTERED BY` column contains a `DESC` order. MSQE will validate that _after_ the plan is generated and throw an `InsertCannotOrderByDescending` fault. This deferred validation makes it hard for clients that rely on whether a query can be successfully planned or not.\r\n\r\nNow with this change, the validation is pushed down to the planning stage as a sql validation step. So the query planning will fail with a `ValidationException` if an `INSERT` or `REPLACE` query contains one or more clustering columns with descending order.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe MSQ fault, `InsertCannotOrderByDescending`, is marked deprecated. An INSERT or REPLACE query containing a `CLUSTERED BY` expression cannot be in descending order. Druid's segment generation code only supports ascending order. A query `ValidationException` is thrown instead of the fault in this scenario.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `DruidSqlParserUtils.java`\r\n * Removed `InsertCannotOrderByDescendingFault.java`\r\n * Adjust existing tests to use `ASC` instead of `DESC`; add new tests with `DESC` where the thrown exception is validated.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nWe are using a lock around a concurrentHashMap for simple one line get/insert operations into the map\r\n\r\nThe concurrentHashMap guarantees that computeIfAbsent will only call the operation once if multiple threads attempt to call it concurrently, so this shouldn't be necessary.\r\n\r\nWe don't need the lock inside doTask either because doTask is called as a part of the operation in computeIfAbsent from either joinAsync or run for a single taskId. Because the map is concurrent, there will be one thread running doTask per taskId.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- remove unnecessary synchronization in K8s task runner.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Hence I kept the `segment/deleted/count` metric as GlobalStat and modify the emit code in EmitClusterStatsAndMetrics to use GlobalStat for `segment/deleted/count` metric instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

Added test to simulate the thread blocking state. We also need to merge PR : https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14427 which disables the parallel merge and also handles the edge cases in the thread release. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MyFoo`\r\n * `OurBar`\r\n * `TheirBaz`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes a bug in the K8s Task Runner when k8sjobLaunchTimeout is hit during launchPeonJobAndWaitForStart  in KubernetesPeonLifecycle.run without the task pod successfully coming up, e.g. when there is no available node.\r\n\r\nCurrently if a task pod fails to come up in time, the overlord marks the task as failed and logs the timeout error message, but doesn't actually cleanup the job. Eventually the cleanupExecutor will cleanup the job, but it's possible for the job to fail to come up in k8sjobLaunchTimeout, then succeed afterwards and actually run even though the overlord has marked it as failed.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix a bug with the K8s overlord extension\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\nUpdate KubernetesPeonsLifecycle to cleanup jobs it has tried to start and that haven't come up.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support to read from multiple Kafka topics in the same supervisor. A multi-topic ingestion can be useful in scenarios where a cluster admin has no control over input streams. Different teams in an org may create different input topics that they can write the data to. However, the cluster admin wants all this data to be queryable in one data source. \r\n\r\nImplementing this change required \r\n- refactoring of Kafka indexing extension to move the type id of partition from Integer to KafkaTopicPartition. KafkaTopicPartition class stores both topic and partition information so a partition `0` for topic tp1 can be distinguished from partition `0` of topic tp2. \r\n- Passing a list of topics instead of one topic when druid tries to find out the list of partitions. This was a one-line change.\r\n\r\nThe refactoring was straightforward as well however the main challenge is maintaining backward compatibility. As the Integer partition id is part of serialized metadata and just simply changing the partition id type would fail existing supervisors. Admins should also be able to roll back to previous versions without running into any compatibility issues. \r\n\r\nIn order to achieve that, KafkaTopicPartition has an additional field called `multiTopicPartition`. This field will be set to true if a particular supervisor is running in multi-topic mode. That mode gets triggered if user is using a comma-separated list of topics such as `tp1,tp2` instead of a single topic. \r\n\r\nThis field must be set explicitly anywhere in the code where `KafkaTopicPartition` object is created. So the code is refactored accordingly so we know in those places whether the supervisor is multi-topic or single-topic. If this field is false, the partition id is serialized in the old format. if the field is false, then `topic` field in this class is completely ignored for all purposes such as comparison, hashCode, etc. If this field is true, then the partition id is serialized in a new format. Below are some examples\r\n\r\nKafkaTopicPartition ( multiTopicPartition : false, topic: \"tp\", partition: 0)\r\n - serialized - \"0\"\r\nKafkaTopicPartition ( multiTopicPartition : false, topic: null, partition: 0)\r\n - serialized - \"0\"\r\nKafkaTopicPartition ( multiTopicPartition : true, topic: \"tp\", partition: 0)\r\n - serialized - \"tp:0\"\r\n\r\nIt's also possible that someone changes the `stream` in a running supervisor and tries to switch between multiple streams and single streams. I will probably add some code to disallow that kind of update. \r\n\r\nWe could also enhance the serialization for KafkaTopicPartition so it can write a format version too. Though I don't think that we will really be changing that anytime soon. \r\n\r\nWith these changes, there should be no impact on currently running supervisors. If an admin tries to roll back a supervisor running in multi-topic mode, that supervisor will start failing (I am yet to explicitly test this scenario)\r\n\r\nThere is no limit on number of topics that a user can set. There is really no overhead that comes from multi-topic support. We didn't have any limit on the number of partitions that user can ingest data from. and we don't have such limit now. It's just that we store extra bits for a partition id. \r\n\r\nThere is also no change required on core task execution engine. A task is assigned the partitions the same way that it was assigned partitions before. Just the partition id is changed.  \r\n\r\nOther todos\r\n - Add an IT for multi-topic kafka ingestion\r\n - ~docs changes~\r\n - ~Possibly adding a feature flag to turn on multi-topic~\r\n\r\nLooking for any design feedback before I finish these todos. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

#14339\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSplits out the bug fixes of #14412 in favor of doing the constant optimization as a standalone PR.\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* auto columns no longer participate in generic 'null column' handling, this was a mistake to try to support and caused ingestion failures due to mismatched ColumnFormat, and will be replaced in the future with nested common format constant column functionality (not in this PR)\r\n* fix bugs with auto columns which contain empty objects, empty arrays, or primitive types mixed with either of these empty constructs\r\n* fix bug with bound filter when upper is null equivalent but is strict (i imagine uncommon... but legal to write as a native query)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes some bugs when using the Kafka input format with schema discovery and partial schema discovery, the former would incorrectly not exclude the column chosen as __time from the timestampSpec (resulting in an extra time column of whatever the source type was), and the latter which just only include the explicit dimensions list if `dimensionSpec` had a non-empty list of dimensions, even if `includeAllDimensions` or `useSchemaDiscovery` was set.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this happening in the future, it now shares the same logic used by `MapInputRowParser` to create the dimensions list.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\nThe goal is a better experience for the user by using the integrated IDE that Jupyter Lab provides and organizing notebooks into folders to provide better navigation for developers making it easier to find what they need.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nThe current SQL endpoint is more suited toward hot queries where the client blocks for the results. The current task endpoint is more of a fire-and-forget API, primarily meant for ingestion. \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to expose a new API called \r\n\"@Path(\"/druid/v2/sql/statements/\")\" which takes the same payload as the current \"/druid/v2/sql\" endpoint and allows users to fetch results in an async manner.\r\n\r\nThe statement execution API runs a single SQL statement which can be:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n\r\n    DDL\r\n\r\n    CREATE [TEMPORARY|EXTERNAL] TABLE AS \r\n\r\n    INSERT \r\n\r\n\r\n### POST SQL statement\r\n\r\n`POST /sql/statements`\r\n\r\nExecutes a SQL statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Request: The post payload is in the same format as https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html#http-post\r\n so that users can easily switch to the new async apis.\r\n Two additional context field:\r\n ```\r\n\r\n    mode: Determines how the query results are fetched. It will have 3 values [SYNC, ASYNC, AUTO] .  For the MVP mode=ASYNC is only supported. \r\n\r\n    execTimeout: The maximum amount of time that the query can execute. Handy to prevent “runaway queries.” Must be lower than any system-configured value. This is distinct from the results expiration timeout. Optional.(not supported for initial version)\r\n    \r\n```\r\n\r\n* Response \r\n\r\n```\r\n#http 200\r\n{\r\n  \"state\":\"RUNNING\",\r\n  \"queryID\":\"queryIDXX\",\r\n  \"createdAt\":\"2023-03-07T12:58:17Z\",\r\n  \"schema\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"col1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"varchar\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"col2\",\r\n      \"type\": \"varchar\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\n#http 200\r\n{\r\n  \"state\": \"FINISHED\",\r\n  \"createdAt\": \"2023-03-07T12:58:17Z\",\r\n  \"queryID\": \"queryIDXX\",\r\n  \"durationInMS\": 20,\r\n  \"schema\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"col1\",\r\n      \"type\": \"varchar\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"col2\",\r\n      \"type\": \"varchar\"\r\n    }\r\n  ],\r\n  \"result\": {\r\n    \"totalRows\": 12412,\r\n    \"totalSize\": 12000,\r\n    \"format\":\"json\",\r\n    \"header\":true,\r\n    \"sampleRecords\": []\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Query execution failures\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sections is exactly similar as https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/querying.html#query-execution-failures\r\nIf a query fails, Druid returns a response with an HTTP response code and a JSON object with the following structure:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"error\" : \"Query timeout\",\r\n  \"errorMessage\" : \"Timeout waiting for task.\",\r\n  \"errorClass\" : \"java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException\",\r\n  \"host\" : \"druid1.example.com:8083\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Status \r\n\r\n`GET /sql/statements/{id}`\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns the same response as the post API. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Results\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n`GET /sql/statements/{id}/results?offset=x&numRows=y&size=s&timeout=z`\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns a page of results if they are available. \r\n```\r\n    id Query Id.\r\n    offset. Row offset of the first row to fetch.\r\n    numRows: number of rows to fetch\r\n    size: Size limit of the results, in bytes. (Optional: size limit in rows. The smallest value wins.)

Description\r\nFixes an issue when using the Kafka input format if the timestamp is missing from a row which can result in a [null pointer exception](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/segment/realtime/appenderator/BaseAppenderatorDriver.java#L294). The fix is to throw a `ParseException` to be [consistent with other input format readers](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/processing/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/data/input/impl/MapInputRowParser.java#L131).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#14339\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nchanges:\r\n* auto columns can now specialize the case when the column contains only constants, avoiding writing any real columns and just producing constant selectors and indexes. since this is backwards incompatible it is gated behind a flag on IndexSpec, optimizeJsonConstantColumns, which should be removed in Druid 28\r\n* auto columns no longer participate in generic 'null column' handling, this was a mistake to try to support and caused ingestion failures due to mismatched ColumnFormat, and is replaced by the new constant column functionality\r\n* fix bugs with auto columns which contain empty objects, empty arrays, or primitive types mixed with either of these empty constructs\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR updates master to Docusaurus 2. It backs up the previous website directory to `website_old`. We can delete it after we’re ready to merge this PR.\r\n\r\nYou can see a build preview here: https://druid-n5fxtlvhm-317brian.vercel.app/docs/latest/design/. It is completely unstyled and uses OOTB Docusaurus2 settings since this repo only acts as the source of truth for docs. `apache/druid-website-src` is what builds the prod site.\r\n\r\nRelated PRs:\r\n\r\n- Separate PR that also upgrades the 26.0.0 release branch: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14417\r\n- Upgrades `druid-website-src` to Docusaurus 2. https://github.com/apache/druid-website-src/pull/394\r\n- Proposes a new publishing process: https://github.com/apache/druid-website-src/pull/392\r\n\r\n### Benefits\r\n\r\n- No longer EOL backend!\r\n- More nesting in the side nav\r\n- Support for extended Markdown (MDX), which lets you add Javascript to Markdown pages.\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- The Markdown parser is stricter for Docusaurus2. Impacted docs have already been updated.\r\n- The format of redirects. To add a new redirect, follow the ones that have already been converted in website/redirects.json in this PR.\r\n- Sidebar syntax\r\n\t- `subcategory` -> `category`\r\n\t- `ids` -> `items`\r\n- The [tab syntax](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs#customizing-tab-headings) used for things like showing the curl and Python equivalent API calls.\r\n- The new config file for the site settings is `website/docusaurus.config.js`\r\n- Minor change but this PR also deletes `docs/operations/getting-started.md`. There was a [redirect that was written for it](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/website/redirects.json#LL198C2-L198C2). The redirect never gets generated though because the page existed. Deleting the file allows for the redirect to get built.)\r\n\r\n### Stayed the same\r\n\r\n- Install Docusaurus with `npm/yarn install` and run the site with `npm/yarn start`.\r\n- All the website pages, like the home page and \"Downloads\" page are still in `apache/druid-website-src`. \r\n- The source of truth for the CSS and styling of the prod site is `apache/druid-website-src`. I didn’t see a need to style this repo since the main concern would be the Markdown rendering correctly, and they both use the same Markdown parser. \r\n- `druid-website-src` still builds the production site\r\n- This repo is the source of truth for the docs, sidebar, and redirects.\r\n\r\n### Need help on the following:\r\n\r\nThe link checking script and broken link behavior. I copied the link checking script over and updated the path to actually point at the build output from `npm run build`, but the output is different depending on how the filepath is declared:\r\n\r\n- `const entries = fg.sync(['./build/docs/**/*.html'])` results in:`There are 13232 issues`. That's definitely wrong\r\n\r\n- `const entries = fg.sync(['./build/docs/latest/*.html'])` results in 1 issue: `Could not find '/docs/latest/design/' linked from './build/docs/latest/index.html`. I think the issue is that it's not going through the directories recursively, so it can't find the file. But if we do the `**` instead of `latest`, we get 13k issues.\r\n\r\nNeither of these are the actual link I broke intentionally to test the link checker, which Docusaurus 2 detects when you run `npm run build`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Docs markdown link couldn't be resolved: (./bob.md) in \"/Users/brian/my-druid-fork/docs/ingestion/ingestion-spec.md\" for version current\r\n```\r\nIn the meantime, we can configure Docusaurus 2 to do a one of 2 things on broken links when someone runs the site or tries to build it: \r\n\r\nWe can either set it to log a command line msg like so for `npm run start/build`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[WARNING] Docs markdown link couldn't be resolved: (../ingestion/in.md) in \"/Users/brian/my-druid-fork/docs/tutorials/index.md\" for version current\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**We went with this option.** See https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14411#issuecomment-1631439915\r\nOr we can surface an error in the rendered site: \r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/53799971/d78e7b8f-2b7e-4246-b5c9-70c36a4554d5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe user can close the error and navigate around the site still.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Add new task actions: SegmentTransactionalAppendAction and SegmentTransactionalReplaceAction\r\n\r\nThe SegmentTransactionalAppendAction is used by appending tasks holding an APPEND lock. When committing segments to the metadata store, they transactionally commit the metadata corresponding to the segment id and the version of the REPLACE lock (if any) that was held on this interval in the druid_segmentVersions table.\r\n\r\nThe SegmentTransactionalReplaceAction is used by replacing tasks that hold a REPLACE lock. When committing the core partitions for a given interval, they also carry forward the previously appended segments held with the same lock (utilizing the metadata committed by the append action) to every version for which used segments exist.\r\n\r\n#### Utilize the new task actions with previously added lock types to facilitate concurrent compaction with batch ingestion\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Add new test Task types: AppendTask and ReplaceTask to help simulate various orders of events\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

change should fix https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14373.\r\n\r\n`RuntimeInfo` can statically be injected from other tests via mocks. It's unclear what test is leaving the runtime info in a dirty state - I went through a few that statically inject `RuntimeInfo` mock (for example, `DruidProcessingConfigTest`)  and couldn't spot something obvious. Regardless, I think it's OK to for a test start with a clean state until we find all the bad candidates. An alternative to what's being done in this PR could be to use static mocks, but resetting any shared mocked state from other test runs is cleaner, IMO. Also, add `@VisibleForTesting` method annotation to the test-only method.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Druid allows segments to be not loaded on any historical. This status is not tracked in the `sys.segments` table on the broker. This makes it difficult to tell from the segments table why a segment is not available, and if that is expected. This also makes it hard to decide what segments to wait for to load after an ingestion is finished, as those segments may never get loaded due to the load rules. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new column `replication factor` to the sys virtual table and populates it with information from the coordinator. If this column is 0, the segment is not assigned to any historical and will never be loaded.\r\n\r\nThis column can be access from the sys table by normal sql queries:\r\n`SELECT \"segment_id\", \"replication_factor\" FROM sys.\"segments\" `\r\n\r\n<img width=\"892\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-14 at 9 12 56 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/9818861/044b1783-c944-4b58-aa93-d41101143ce8\">\r\n\r\nResponse: \r\n```[\r\n    [\r\n        \"segment_id\",\r\n        \"replication_factor\"\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n        \"STRING\",\r\n        \"LONG\"\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n        \"VARCHAR\",\r\n        \"BIGINT\"\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n        \"kttm_simple_-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z_146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z_2023-06-14T03:38:24.502Z\",\r\n        -1\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n        \"kttm_simple_-146136543-09-08T08:23:32.096Z_146140482-04-24T15:36:27.903Z_2023-06-14T03:40:13.463Z\",\r\n        2\r\n    ]\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\n- Adds a new virtual column `replication factor` to the sys table.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve the human readability of the error messages arising from \r\na. external data being unparseable by MSQ\r\nb. String fields containing NULL byte (\\^@) which is not supported by ROW based frames (to allow for a fast byte by byte comparison)\r\n\r\nError messages arising from exceptions falling in the above categories are now gonna have better readability, actionable items and more contextual information which will help the user locate the error easily.\r\n\r\nFollowing are the major changes incorporated in the PR:\r\n1. Currently, all the data writing code was wrapped and rethrown in a ParseException which is incorrect, since errors in writing the frame's fields can be due to many causes. This PR removes that catch-all try..catch block.\r\n2. To improve the parsing information around the externally unparseable values, the ScanFrameProcessor will include information about the row and the dimension, and the input source.\r\n3. InvalidNullByte fault is now revived. Earlier it had dead code which wasn't used anywhere apart from the tests. Refactoring in this PR makes the fault usable. \r\n4. InvalidNullByteException has been improved - The caller encountering the exception can rethrow the exception after decorating it with the contextual information. This is helpful since the lowermost level of Frame where this exception generates donot contain enough information about the row/column etc which contained the null byte. As the exception bubbles up, the caller can keep on adding more contextual information to the exception. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the number of slots needed for for a streaming supervisor to handover quickly is 2 * number of tasks needed for reading from the stream. This is because when the taskDuration expires, the previously reading tasks need to publish the segments, and if this takes time, and there are no available slots on the cluster, Druid will not be reading from the stream until a slot is available.\r\n\r\nThis change makes it so that during regular operations, tasks are rolled over one at a time, so that an operator can plan to have a capacity of number of tasks need to read from the stream + 1. For config changes to the supervisor, like taskCount, all tasks will need to stop, so an operator should factor this in to their capacity planning. If config changes are rare, this will make it so that you do not need as much free capacity in the cluster for stable operations.\r\n\r\n#### Current behavior\r\n\r\nHere are some screenshots of metrics from a test where we ran streaming ingestion in a cluster with a capacity of 24 slots. The was ingesting data from a kafka topic with 24 partitions using 10 tasks.\r\nDuring this test, there was a batch ingestion task running that took 7 slots.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1272\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-21 at 1 40 32 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/44787917/9a34589d-344d-4601-bf5a-874af8561acc\">\r\n\r\nThis screenshot shows 17 tasks being used from ~ 8am - 9:35am. At 9:35am, the batch task dies, and the task count goes down to 10. The screenshot shows spikes in used task slots at 7:54, 9:34 and from 8:54-56.\r\n\r\nThese spikes are when the taskDuration has expired and they need to rollover. This shows that the system needs to preserve capacity for the tasks to publish segments otherwise there is a risk of increasing kafka lag. The next screenshot shows kafka lag during this run at ~8:55, which shows that there were some partitions that could not get a slot, and so they experienced a spike in lag.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1270\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-21 at 1 50 38 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/44787917/0505ed89-baee-470f-8277-b408e8d5a4a5\">\r\n\r\n#### Behavior when setting `stopTaskCount`\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1275\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-21 at 2 01 23 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/44787917/fd68b648-95a2-4431-af94-47ffde8124f9\">\r\n\r\nHere we see the number of tasks rolling over at any point in time is capped, and that it takes ~ 10 minutes for all the tasks with an expired task duration to stop. Kafka lag metrics remain very low and there are no spikes when the taskDuration is hit.\r\n<img width=\"1269\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-06-21 at 2 04 44 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/44787917/9135106e-e772-49bd-af3c-ee99a1aecaa2\">\r\n\r\n#### Why not on by default / documented\r\n\r\nThis behavior of rolling a subset of tasks over is not on by default because it is not clear to me what a good default would be. Some defaults I've considered \r\n* Make it so that all tasks rollover in 10 minutes, so if you have 100 tasks in a supervisor, it would bounce 10 at a time.\r\n* Make it so that all tasks rollover within the taskDuration so that the max time for any task will be 2X taskDuration\r\n* Make it so that we always rollover 1 task at a time. This limits the upper capacity needed, but tasks may run for a lot longer than the taskDuration. Eg. with a taskDuration of 1 hour and 100 tasks, all taking 1 minute to publish segments, tasks would take ~ 160 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe first 2 rely on assumptions that the time it takes to publish segments will be predictable, which may not be the case, so we can't provide guarantees for capacity planning that the number of tasks you will need is X.\r\nThe 3rd option is nice for capacity planning, but could result in tasks holding on to locks for a much longer time than anticipated if the number of tasks in a supervisor is large.\r\n\r\nThe config `stopTaskCount` is not documented so that we do not need to support it in the future when we decide what the best behavior is and what it should be by default.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nIf the current leader coordinator is asked to stop being leader, the following happens:\r\n- The `DruidCoordinator.balancerExec` (used for strategy cost computations) is shutdown\r\n- The currently running duty finishes execution normally and no more duties are executed\r\n- An exception to this is the `BalanceSegments` duty, which can exit abnormally or even get stuck in the race conditions explained below.\r\n\r\n#### ✅ Case 1: `balancerExec.submit()` after `balancerExec.shutdown()`, `BalanceSegments` exits abnormally\r\n\r\nTypical sequence of events:\r\n- Current coordinator stops being leader and `balancerExec` is shutdown\r\n- `CostBalancerStrategy.findNewSegmentHomeBalancer()` or any other strategy method is invoked\r\n- `balancerExec.submit()` is invoked with `computeCost()` tasks\r\n- Since the executor has already been shutdown, submission of new tasks throws a `RejectedExecutionException` and ends the coordinator run as desired\r\n\r\n#### ❌ Case 2: `balancerExec.submit()` before `balancerExec.shutdown()`, `BalanceSegments` gets stuck\r\n\r\nTypical sequence of events:\r\n- `BalanceSegments` duty is in progress\r\n- `CostBalancerStrategy.findNewSegmentHomeBalancer()` is invoked for some segment\r\n- `computeCost()` tasks for, say 5 servers, are submitted to the executor\r\n- Executor picks up 3 of these tasks and starts executing them\r\n- Coordinator stops being leader and `balancerExec` is shutdown\r\n- Since the `computeCost()` tasks do not handle interrupts, the 3 picked up tasks finish execution normally\r\n- But the 2 remaining tasks are never picked up by the executor as it is already shutdown\r\n- The method `findNewSegmentHomeBalancer` waits indefinitely for the futures to finish\r\n\r\n#### ✅ Case 3: Change in `balancerComputeThreads` dynamic config\r\n\r\nA change in this config also results in a shutdown of the `balancerExec`. But this shutdown is never done concurrently with the coordinator duties and thus doesn't cause the coordinator to get stuck.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Add a timeout of 1 minute to the `resultFuture.get()`. 1 minute is the typical time for a full coordinator run and is more than enough time for cost computations of a single segment.\r\n- Raise an alert if an exception is encountered while computing costs and if the executor has not been shutdown. This is because a shutdown is intentional and does not require an alert.\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-07T16:41:33Z","updated_at":"2023-07-19T10:33:06Z","closed_at":"2023-06-08T09:59:20Z","merged_at":"2023-06-08T09:59:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"12e8fa5c97a37ca7636bafda17a0cbb85ff0747f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":632425053,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MzI0MjUwNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Balancing/Coordination","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nUpgrades the React dependency to v18.\r\n\r\nNote that there are several dependent packages whose peer dependency ranges still do not include 18. With the default npm peer dependency mode (strict), this would actually cause `npm install` to fail, so I switched to the legacy peer dependency mode. Keeping strict mode would involve upgrading, or in most cases, switching to alternate dependencies for those that have stopped receiving updates (react-table v6, react-splitter-layout, react-diff-viewer).\r\n\r\nIt was also not possible to switch to the [new JSX transform](https://legacy.reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html) because react-table has an implicit dependency on the `.createElement` API being used in order to distinguish between class and function components.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

PR adds a new table `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES`. Resolves https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/14346.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n The implementation currently exposes information about all functions in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES`. The table contains the following columns:\r\n   * ROUTINE_CATALOG: Name of the database. Always set to druid.\r\n   * ROUTINE_SCHEMA: Name of the schema. Always set to INFORMATION_SCHEMA.\r\n   * ROUTINE_NAME: Name of the function or operator. E.g., APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT_DS_THETA\r\n   * ROUTINE_TYPE: Type of routine. Always set to FUNCTION.\r\n   * IS_AGGREGATOR: Is the routine an aggregator or not. Returns YES for aggregator functions; NO for scalar functions.\r\n   * SIGNATURES: Possible signatures for the routine as a string.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince Calcite is the source of truth for all the registered functions, including ones loaded through custom extensions, the implementation uses the Calcite's operator table to extract this information at runtime.\r\n\r\n\r\nA preview of the table from the Druid console:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1720\" alt=\"CleanShot 2023-06-09 at 13 09 02@2x\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/8687261/ac96d78d-c5fd-48cf-be96-1b08efbb37e8\">\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nExpose Druid functions via `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ROUTINES` table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `InformationSchema.java`\r\n * `DruidOperatorTable.java`\r\n * `InformationSchemaTest.java`\r\n * `DruidOperatorTableTest.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\n\r\nMSQ queries return the results in the query reports. Querying large data sources can generate a lot of rows, all of which will get materialized in the query reports, causing them to grow very large. This PR limits the results of the SELECT queries that we put in the reports.\r\n\r\nNote: Only way to fetch the complete result set after this change would be to run the query using the native engine, however, we might add a way to execute long-running queries that post their complete results in a different. Therefore the rows in the reports would serve as a preview to the actual result set.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nSELECT queries executed using MSQ generate only a subset of the results in the query reports. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `ControllerImpl`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
