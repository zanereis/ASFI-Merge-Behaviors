the user to customize the serialization of values with the protobuf protocol.\r\n\r\nI split this PR into several commits, hopefully this will make it easier to review:\r\n - Renamed AuthenticationRequest to HandshakeRequest - this is because we will be sending multiple fields as part of the handshake, not all of them authentication related.\r\n - Cleaned up the protobuf connection states to allow for handshakes without authorization\r\n - Added a ValueSerializer interface on the server\r\n - Allowing the experimental driver to use the ValueSerializer.\r\n\r\nThank

preferCD flag is now passed down to convertPdxInstanceIfNeeded.\r\n\r\nIf preferCD is true then the caller wants the serialized form back\r\nfrom the load and in that case the PdxInstances bytes are wrapped\r\nin a PreferBytesCachedDeserializable and it is returned.\r\n\r\nSo now the PdxInstance will only be deserialized if a local get is\r\ndone and pdx-read-serialized is false.","created_at":"2018-03-27T20:24:35Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T21:58:15Z","closed_at":"2018-04-03T21:58:09Z","merged_at":"2018-04-03T21:58:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"8894267dc020246894e616d277b115cafade554b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nreich","id":960205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MDIwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/960205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich","html_url":"https://github.com/nreich","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nreich/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pivotal-eshu","id":11180099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTgwMDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11180099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu","html_url":"https://github.com/pivotal-eshu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pivotal-eshu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"lgallinat","id":11180732,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTgwNzMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11180732?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat","html_url":"https://github.com/lgallinat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lgallinat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/1693/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/1693/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/1693/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/97da7a186c505f7375d6e0b9429ae3ad20354fe5","head":{"label":"dschneider-pivotal:feature/GEODE-4840","ref":"feature/GEODE-4840","sha":"97da7a186c505f7375d6e0b9429ae3ad20354fe5","user":{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11197400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/dschneider-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102797819,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDI3OTc4MTk=","name":"geode","full_name":"dschneider-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"
