makes it possible to enable request logs for deprecated protocol api versions without enabling it for the rest. Combined with the ability to enable/disable dynamically, it makes it a bit easier to collect the information about deprecated clients that is not available via metrics.\r\n\r\nI manually verified that:\r\n1. If the request logger is configured at `INFO` level, only deprecated protocol api versions are logged and they are logged at `INFO` level.\r\n2. If the request logger is configured at `DEBUG` level, all requests are logged but the log level is `INFO` for deprecated protocol api versions and `DEBUG` for the rest.\r\n3. If the request logger is configured at `WARN` level (the default), no requests are logged.\r\n\r\nThe cherry-pick from trunk had one conflict: `RequestConvertToJson` was rewritten from Scala to Java in trunk. In addition, I added an upgrade note for 3.9.1.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

v0/v1 record batches to v2 during compaction even if said record batches would be\r\nwritten with no change otherwise. A few important details:\r\n\r\n1. V0 compressed record batch with multiple records is converted into single V2 record batch\r\n2. V0 uncompressed records are converted into single record V2 record batches\r\n3. V0 records are converted to V2 records with timestampType set to `CreateTime` and the\r\ntimestamp is `-1`.\r\n4. The `KAFKA-4298` workaround is no longer needed since the conversion to V2 fixes\r\nthe issue too.\r\n5. Removed a log warning applicable to consumers older than 0.10.1 - they are no longer\r\nsupported.\r\n6. Added back the ability to append records with v0/v1 (for testing only).\r\n7. The creation of the leader epoch cache is no longer optional since the record version\r\nconfig is effectively always V2.\r\n\r\nAdd integration tests, these tests existed before #18267 - restored, modified and\r\nextended them.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

makes it possible to enable request logs for deprecated protocol api versions without enabling it for the rest. Combined with the ability to enable/disable dynamically, it makes it a bit easier to collect the information about deprecated clients that is not available via metrics.\r\n\r\nThis isn't particularly useful in trunk/4.0 since there are no deprecated api versions in these versions, but it will be useful for older branches. I intend to backport to those branches and add a release note in the backport regarding the change in behavior.\r\n\r\nI manually verified that:\r\n1. If the request logger is configured at `INFO` level, only deprecated protocol api versions are logged and they are logged at `INFO` level.\r\n2. If the request logger is configured at `DEBUG` level, all requests are logged but the log level is `INFO` for deprecated protocol api versions and `DEBUG` for the rest.\r\n3. If the request logger is configured at `WARN` level (the default), no requests are logged.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-24T16:37:05Z","updated_at":"2024-12-27T08:04:24Z","closed_at":"2024-12-27T08:04:19Z","merged_at":"2024-12-27T08:04:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"dfb178a1d8d2d847534e3340bcf2267422496975","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

PR implements the following gauges in KafkaRaftMetrics, BrokerServerMetrics, and ControllerServerMetrics:\r\n\r\n**KafkaRaftMetrics**:\r\n- `number-of-voters`: number of voters for a KRaft topic partition. All of the replicas will report this metric.\r\n- `number-of-observers`: number of observers being tracked by the KRaft topic partition leader.\r\n- `uncommitted-voter-change`: 1 if there is a voter change that has not been committed, 0 otherwise.\r\n\r\n`number-of-observers` and `uncommitted-voter-change` will only be present on the active controller, since it does not make sense for other replicas to report these metrics. If `number-of-offline-voters` is implemented, it will also only be reported by the leader.\r\n\r\nIn order to make these two metrics thread-safe, `KafkaRaftMetrics` needs to be passed into `LeaderState`, and therefore `QuorumState`. This introduces a circularity since the `KafkaRaftMetrics` constructor takes in `QuorumState`. To break the circularity for now, the logic using `QuorumState` will be moved to a `KafkaRaftMetrics#initialize` method.\r\n\r\n**BrokerServerMetrics**:\r\n- `ignored-static-voters`: 1 if reading the voter set from the log, 0 if the voter set comes from static configuration.\r\n\r\n**ControllerServerMetrics**:\r\n- `IgnoredStaticVoters`: 1 if reading the voter set from the log, 0 if the voter set comes from static configuration. (same as the metric above but for controllers)\r\n- ~`IsObserver`: 1 if the controller node is not a voter for the KRaft cluster metadata partition, 0 otherwise.~ This metric will not be implemented in this PR. Instead, the `current-state` metric in conjunction with the presence of `kafka.server.controller` metrics can be used to provide the same information.\r\n\r\nTo implement the `ignored-static-voters` metrics, this PR introduces the `ExternalKRaftMetrics` class, which allows for higher layer metrics objects to be accessible within the `raft` module. `number-of-voters` and `ignored-static-voters` will be updated in `KRaftControlRecordStateMachine#handleBatch` when a new VotersRecord is read from log.\r\n\r\n**Testing**:\r\n- Unit tests in `KRaftControlRecordStateMachineTest` and `KafkaRaftMetricsTest`.\r\n- Added/modified tests in `KafkaRaftClientReconfigTest` to verify new metrics behavior.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-23T17:28:24Z","updated_at":"2025-01-30T23:35:02Z","closed_at":"2025-01-30T23:35:02Z","merged_at":"2025-01-30T23:35:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"184b8918717efc322cf01557ef90540ff5a6c2b0","assignee":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

in this change:\r\n1. Remove deprecated protocol api versions from json files.\r\n3. Remove fields that are no longer used from json files (affects ListOffsets, OffsetCommit, DescribeConfigs).\r\n4. Remove record down-conversion support from KafkaApis.\r\n5. No longer return `Errors.UNSUPPORTED_COMPRESSION_TYPE` on the fetch path[1].\r\n6. Deprecate `TopicConfig. MESSAGE_DOWNCONVERSION_ENABLE_CONFIG` and made the relevant\r\nconfigs (`message.downconversion.enable` and `log.message.downcoversion.enable`) no-ops since\r\ndown-conversion is no longer supported. It was an oversight not to deprecate this via KIP-724.\r\n7. Fix `shouldRetainsBufferReference` to handle null request schemas for a given version.\r\n8. Simplify producer logic since it only supports the v2 record format now.\r\n9. Fix tests so they don't exercise protocol api versions that have been removed.\r\n10. Add upgrade note.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n1. System tests have a lot of failures, but those tests fail for trunk too and I didn't see any issues specific to this change - it's hard to be sure given the number of failing tests, but let's not block on that given the other testing that has been done (see below).\r\n3. Java producers and consumers with version 0.9-0.10.1 don't have api versions support and hence they fail in an ungraceful manner: the broker disconnects and the clients reconnect until the relevant timeout is triggered.\r\n4. Same thing seems to happen for the console producer 0.10.2 although it's unclear why since api versions should be supported. I will look into this separately, it's unlikely to be related to this PR.\r\n5. Console consumer 0.10.2 fails with the expected error and a reasonable message[2].\r\n6. Console producer and consumer 0.11.0 works fine, newer versions should naturally also work fine.\r\n7. kcat 1.5.0 (based on librdkafka 1.1.0) produce and consume fail with a reasonable message[3][4].\r\n8. kcat 1.6.0-1.7.0 (based on librdkafka 1.5.0 and 1.7.0 respectively) consume fails with a reasonable message[5].\r\n9. kcat 1.6.0-1.7.0 produce works fine.\r\n10. kcat 1.7.1  (based on librdkafka 1.8.2) works fine for consumer and produce.\r\n11. confluent-go-client (librdkafka based) 1.8.2 works fine for consumer and produce.\r\n12. I will test more clients, but I don't think we need to block the PR on that.\r\n\r\nNote that this also completes part of KIP-724: produce v2 and lower as well as fetch v3 and lower are no longer supported.\r\n\r\nFuture PRs will remove conditional code that is no longer needed (some of that has been done in KafkaApis,\r\nbut only what was required due to the schema changes). We can probably do that in master only as it does\r\nnot change behavior.\r\n\r\nNote that I did not touch `ignorable` fields even though some of them could have been\r\nchanged. The reasoning is that this could result in incompatible changes for clients\r\nthat use new protocol versions without setting such fields _if_ we don't manually\r\nvalidate their presence. I will file a JIRA ticket to look into this carefully for each\r\ncase (i.e. if we do validate their presence for the appropriate versions, we can\r\nset them to ignorable=false in the json file).\r\n\r\n[1] We would return this error if a fetch < v10 was used and the compression topic config was set\r\nto zstd, but we would not do the same for the case where zstd was compressed at the producer\r\nlevel (the most common case). Since there is no efficient way to do the check for the common\r\ncase, I made it consistent for both by having no checks.\r\n[2] ```org.apache.kafka.common.errors.UnsupportedVersionException: The broker is too new to support JOIN_GROUP version 1```\r\n[3]```METADATA|rdkafka#producer-1| [thrd:main]: localhost:9092/bootstrap: Metadata request failed: connected: Local: Required feature not

This required removing all import statements, variable declarations, method parameters, method return types, and static method calls related to `AccessHint` in `RocksDBGenericOptionsToDbOptionsColumnFamilyOptionsAdapter.java `RocksDBGenericOptionsToDbOptionsColumnFamilyOptionsAdapterTest.java Unused methods are removed in RocksDBGenericOptionsToDbOptionsColumnFamilyOptionsAdapter.java\r\n\r\n*   **Removal of `NO_FILE_CLOSES`:** The `NO_FILE_CLOSES` metric was also removed in RocksDB 9.7.3. The calculation for `numberOfOpenFiles` in `RocksDBMetricsRecorder.java` has been adjusted to now track the total number of file opens since the last reset. The previous calculation, which subtracted `NO_FILE_CLOSES` from `NO_FILE_OPENS`, is no longer possible.\r\nThe reason RocksDB team removed NO_FILE_CLOSES it seems to me they detected not properly working: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Afacebook%2Frocksdb+NO_FILE_CLOSES&type=issues\r\n\r\nAny feedback or any proposed changes you would like me to do are welcome let me know.\r\n@cadonna @mjsax \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

interfaces for defining task assignors. Task assignors are pure functions, mapping the state of the group and a topology to a target assignment. We include a mock assignor, which we will be able to use when testing / benchmarking without the complexities of the sticky task assignor and the high-availability task assignor. We may remove the mock assignor in before the streams rebalance protocol goes GA.\r\n\r\nThe consumer groups introduce these interfaces to establish a clear separation between the group coordinator code and the pluggable assignors, which may live outside the group coordinator code. We have removed pluggable assignors in KIP-1071, but I think it still makes sense to keep these interfaces for having a clean interface for people to code against. This will pay off, if we plan on making the task assignors pluggable later.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

in the Streams Rebalance Protocol send an \"unconfigured\" representation of the topology to the broker. That is, the number of input topics and (some) internal topics is not fixed, regular expressions are not resolved. The broker takes this description of the topology and, together with the current state of the topics on the broker, derives a `ConfiguredTopology`. The configured topology is what is being returned from `StreamsGroupDescribe`, and has all number of partitions defined, and regular expressions resolved. The configured topology also contains missing internal topics that need to be created, and potentially configuration errors, such as missing source topics.\r\n\r\nIn this change, we add the internal data structures for representing the configured topology. They differ in some details from the data structures used in the RPCs. Most importantly, they can be evolved independently of the public interface.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify

looking at the message formatters in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/18261, I have noticed at few incorrect test cases.\r\n* We should not log anything when the record type is unknown because the formatters have clear goals.\r\n* We should not parse the value when the key is null or when the key cannot be parsed. While it works in the tests, in practice, this is wrong because we cannot assume that type of the value if the type of the key is not defined. The key drives the type of the entire record.\r\n\r\nThis should be cherry-picked to 4.0 branch if we agree on the changes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

patch is the first one in a series to improve how coordinator records are managed. It focuses on making coordinator records first class citizen in the generator.\r\n* Introduce `coordinator-key` and `coordinator-value` in the schema;\r\n* Introduce `apiKey` for those. This is done to avoid relying on the version to determine the type.\r\n* It also allows the generator to enforce some rules: the key cannot use flexible versions, the key must have a single version `0`, there must be a key and a value for a given api key, etc.\r\n* It generates an enum with all the coordinator record types. This is pretty handy in the code.\r\n\r\nThe patch also updates the group coordinators to use those.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-12-18T16:02:11Z","updated_at":"2024-12-20T11:16:17Z","closed_at":"2024-12-20T11:16:14Z","merged_at":"2024-12-20T11:16:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"d67379c3105c5fad92376d1633d91736139ca73f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka
