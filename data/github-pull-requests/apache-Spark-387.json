allows specifying only one set of AWS credentials that will be used by Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL) for accessing Kinesis, DynamoDB and CloudWatch.\n#### Motivation\n\nIn a scenario where one needs to read from a Kinesis Stream owned by a different AWS account the user usually has minimal rights (i.e. only read from the stream). In this case creating the DynamoDB table in KCL will fail. Instead the DynamoDB table should be created in your own AWS account.\n#### Proposal\n\nThis PR adds a new serializable class `AWSCredentialPool` containing credentials for Kinesis, DynamoDB and CloudWatch that is passed as a parameter to `KinesisUtils.createStream()`. These credentials are then passed to the constructor of `KinesisClientLibConfiguration`.\n\n@tdas @cfregly please review if this PR is OK.\n\nSee

current implementation of statistics of UnaryNode does not considering output (for example, Project may product much less columns than it's child), we should considering it to have a better guess.\n\nWe usually only join with few columns from a parquet table, the size of projected plan could be much smaller than the original parquet files. Having a better guess of size help we choose between broadcast join or sort merge join.\n\nAfter this PR, I saw a few queries choose broadcast join other than sort merge join without turning spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold for every query, ended up with about 6-8X improvements on end-to-end time.\n\nWe use `defaultSize` of DataType to estimate the size of a column, currently For DecimalType/StringType/BinaryType and UDT, we are over-estimate too much (4096 Bytes), so this PR change them to some more reasonable values. Here are the new defaultSize for them:\n\nDecimalType:  8 or 16 bytes, based on the precision\nStringType:  20 bytes\nBinaryType: 100 bytes\nUDF: default size of SQL type\n\nThese numbers are not perfect (hard to have a perfect number for them), but should be better than 4096.\n","created_at":"2016-02-16T01:34:19Z","updated_at":"2016-02-23T21:14:07Z","closed_at":"2016-02-23T20:57:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6edc2760e83d399f4c2fa993a950d58f6a3dd30c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11210/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11210/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11210/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6a714caabeac34d6b07084af9ea9c5110a604370","head":{"label":"davies:statics","ref":"statics","sha":"6a714caabeac34d6b07084af9ea9c5110a604370","user":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21724875,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTcyNDg3NQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"davies","id":40902,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwOTAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40902?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies","html_url":"https://github.com/davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/davies/spark","description":"Mirror

PR introduces a 64-bit hashcode expression. Such an expression is especially usefull for HyperLogLog++ and other probabilistic datastructures.\n\nI have implemented xxHash64 which is a 64-bit hashing algorithm created by Yann Colet and Mathias Westerdahl. This is a high speed (C implementation runs at memory bandwidth) and high quality hashcode. It exploits both Instruction Level Parralellism (for speed) and the multiplication and rotation techniques (for quality) like MurMurHash does.\n\nThe initial results are promising. I have added a CG'ed test to the `HashBenchmark`, and this results in the following results (running from SBT):\n\n```\nRunning benchmark: Hash For simple\n  Running case: interpreted version\n

shuffle service is completely unusable since Spark 1.6.0 . The problem seems to occur since the move from akka to netty in the networking layer. Until now, a connection from the driver to each shuffle service was used as a signal for the shuffle service to determine, whether the driver is still running. Since 1.6.0, this connection is closed after `spark.shuffle.io.connectionTimeout` (or `spark.network.timeout` if the former is not set) due to it being idle. The shuffle service interprets this as a signal that the driver has stopped, despite the driver still being alive. Thus, shuffle files are deleted before the application has stopped.\n\nContext and analysis:\n- spark shuffle fails with mesos after 2mins: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12583\n- External shuffle service broken w/ Mesos: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13159\n### Proposed fix:\n\nInstead of relying on a connection being disconnected, or a heartbeat signal lost, the mesos shuffle service periodically checks with the mesos master whether the framework (spark application) is still running:\n\nEvery `spark.storage.blockManagerSlaveTimeoutMs / 4` the mesos shuffle service retrieves the leading master's `/master/state.json`. It checks whether it got a reply from the actual leading master and updates a \"last seen\" timestamp in its internal state (spark applications on mesos register with the external shuffle service using their framework id). Then, it deletes the temporary files of all the frameworks (that have previously registered), that have not been reported as running in the past `spark.storage.blockManagerSlaveTimeoutMs`.\n\nIt requires `mesos-resolve` to be on the `PATH` where the shuffle service is running. This is used to find the leading master in a mesos-HA setup (through zookeeper).\n\nFurther, `spark.master` needs to be set when the service is started.\n","created_at":"2016-02-15T17:21:50Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T07:16:09Z","closed_at":"2016-02-16T10:48:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9a4bf0e3264a1469145928d2bc125f2cb5a2484a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e387def7f2b1a82d90f337606f49b562401d0714","head":{"label":"bbossy:SPARK-12583-mesos-shuffle-service-fix","ref":"SPARK-12583-mesos-shuffle-service-fix","sha":"e387def7f2b1a82d90f337606f49b562401d0714","user":{"login":"bbossy","id":4428853,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0Mjg4NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4428853?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy","html_url":"https://github.com/bbossy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbossy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"adb548365012552e991d51740bfd3c25abf0adec","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

there're two problems in dynamic allocation when maximum task failure is met:\n1. Number of running tasks will possibly be negative, which will affect the calculation of needed executors.\n2. Executors may never be idle. Currently we use the executor to tasks mapping relation to identify the status of executors, in maximum task failure situation, some `TaskEnd` events may never be delivered, which makes the related executor always be busy.\n\nThis patch tries to fix these two issues, please review, thanks a lot.\n\nCC @andrewor14 and @tgravescs .

that are passed to `OneToOneStreamManager.registerStream` need to be freed by the manager once it's done using them. However, the current code only frees them in certain error-cases and not during typical operation. This isn't a major problem today, but it will cause memory leaks after we implement better locking / pinning in the BlockManager (see #10705).\n\nThis patch modifies the relevant network code so that the ManagedBuffers are freed as soon as the messages containing them are processed by the lower-level Netty message sending code.\n\n/cc @zsxwing for

is a step towards merging `SQLContext` and `HiveContext`. A new internal `Catalog` API was introduced in #10982 and extended in #11069. This patch introduces an implementation of this API using `HiveClient`, an existing interface to Hive. It also extends `HiveClient` with additional calls to Hive that are needed to complete the catalog implementation.\n\n**Where should I start reviewing?** The new catalog introduced is `HiveCatalog`. This class is relatively simple because it just calls `HiveClientImpl`, where most of the new logic is. I would _not_ start with `HiveClient`, `HiveQl`, or `HiveMetastoreCatalog`, which are modified mainly because of a refactor.\n\n**Why is this patch so big?** I had to refactor `HiveClient` to remove an intermediate representation of databases, tables, partitions etc. After this refactor `CatalogTable` convert directly to and from `HiveTable` (etc.). Otherwise we would have to first convert `CatalogTable` to the intermediate representation and then convert that to `HiveTable`, which is messy.\n\n**The new class hierarchy is as follows:**\n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.Catalog\n  - org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.catalog.InMemoryCatalog\n  - org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveCatalog\n```\n\nNote that, as of this patch, none of these classes are currently used anywhere yet. This will come in the future before the Spark 2.0 release.\n\nWIP pending tests and potential cleanups.\n","created_at":"2016-02-12T22:26:00Z","updated_at":"2020-01-20T08:17:36Z","closed_at":"2016-02-21T22:17:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6a444fb48e9b649d14529d6c5be86c0245c1d0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d9a77230c927a71d6ee8fbc45185379ce97e6218","head":{"label":"andrewor14:hive-catalog","ref":"hive-catalog","sha":"d9a77230c927a71d6ee8fbc45185379ce97e6218","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

\n\nWhen we call the typeSuffix method, it will call the dataType and get the LongType for the suffix(\"L\"). But in the complex data type(like CreatArray) cases, the dataType will also evaluate the children's nullability, which is not necessary for the typeSuffix. \n\nFor the proposed fix, I will create a prettyDataType, in parallel to the dataType in the expression. At the base, it defaults to the dataType. It is only used by typeSuffix in the NameExpression for now.\n\nSo the main changes is at the typeSuffix in the NameExpression, and the complexTypeCreator. The rest of files just override the prettyDataType from the abstract class Expression when their \"dataType\" method relies on other expression's \"dataType\"\n\nThen for those complex types, the \"prettyDataType\" does not try to evaluate the \"nullable\" but just pass a default that will not be used at all by the caller, \"typeSuffix\".\n","created_at":"2016-02-12T19:02:55Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T16:15:36Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T16:15:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0adf2bec4c4991af90d429840b3926bf1918061c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11184/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11184/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11184/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/86b7556e976868b375a1d8dcedc5f200be871e23","head":{"label":"kevinyu98:working_on_spark-13253","ref":"working_on_spark-13253","sha":"86b7556e976868b375a1d8dcedc5f200be871e23","user":{"login":"kevinyu98","id":7550280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTAyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7550280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38393679,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODM5MzY3OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"kevinyu98/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kevinyu98","id":7550280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTAyODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7550280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98","html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kevinyu98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kevinyu98/spark","description":"Mirror

patch removes the need to build a full Spark assembly before running the `dev/mima` script.\n- I modified the `tools` project to remove a direct dependency on Spark, so `sbt/sbt tools/fullClasspath` will now return the classpath for the `GenerateMIMAIgnore` class itself plus its own dependencies.\n  - This required me to delete two classes full of dead code that we don't use anymore\n- `GenerateMIMAIgnore` now uses [ClassUtil](http://software.clapper.org/classutil/) to find all of the Spark classes rather than our homemade JAR traversal code. The problem in our own code was that it didn't handle folders of classes properly, which is necessary in order to generate excludes with an assembly-free Spark build.\n- `./dev/mima` no longer runs through `spark-class`, eliminating the need to reason about classpath ordering between `SPARK_CLASSPATH` and the assembly.\n","created_at":"2016-02-12T01:24:08Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T18:10:11Z","closed_at":"2016-03-11T07:30:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0124b143e6f16391c488818b9520ebc4cec56a0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11178/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11178/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11178/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/86cd51392d64e50b3a81d5fc5d436feccd83d9fa","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:remove-assembly-in-run-tests","ref":"remove-assembly-in-run-tests","sha":"86cd51392d64e50b3a81d5fc5d436feccd83d9fa","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

lots of SQL operators, we have metrics for both of input and output, the number of input rows should be exactly the number of output rows of child, we could only have metrics for output rows.\n\nAfter we improved the performance using whole stage codegen, the overhead of SQL metrics are not trivial anymore, we should avoid that if it's not necessary.\n\nThis PR remove all the SQL metrics for number of input rows, add SQL metric of number of output rows for all LeafNode. All remove the SQL metrics from those operators that have the same number of rows from input and output (for example, Projection, we may don't need that).\n\nThe new SQL UI will looks

patch integrates these two so that the codegen'ed function is run over\nbatches of rows. This removes all of the per row iterator calls for the\ncode paths that support this. Unfortunately, this patch combines a few different\nthings.\n1. Refactor some of SqlNewHadoopRDD/ParquetRelation to produce RDD's of ColumnarBatch\n   in addition to RDD's of InternalRow. This adds a new level of class hierarchy to minimize\n   code duplication. This could use further refactoring to not require the low level\n   components to return RDD's.\n2. Minor refactoring of WholeStageCodegen to handle leaf operators that produce batches.\n","created_at":"2016-02-09T23:56:48Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T04:48:38Z","closed_at":"2016-02-11T04:48:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"27a160853e54358cd7d05493c2f84ad236160445","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5717783f73c3659f95c58d840621371c66296a5a","head":{"label":"nongli:spark-13255","ref":"spark-13255","sha":"5717783f73c3659f95c58d840621371c66296a5a","user":{"login":"nongli","id":242468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/242468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli","html_url":"https://github.com/nongli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30051398,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDA1MTM5OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"nongli/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nongli","id":242468,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MjQ2OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/242468?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli","html_url":"https://github.com/nongli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nongli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nongli/spark","description":"Mirror

patch for SPARK-8964 (\"use Exchange to perform shuffle in Limit\" / #7334) inadvertently broke the planning of the TakeOrderedAndProject operator: because ReturnAnswer was the new root of the query plan, the TakeOrderedAndProject rule was unable to match before BasicOperators.\n\nThis patch fixes this by moving the `TakeOrderedAndCollect` and `CollectLimit` rules into the same strategy.\n\nIn addition, I made changes to the TakeOrderedAndProject operator in order to make its `doExecute()` method lazy and added a new TakeOrderedAndProjectSuite which tests the new code path.\n\n/cc @davies and @marmbrus for review.\n","created_at":"2016-02-09T23:40:38Z","updated_at":"2016-08-29T19:20:37Z","closed_at":"2016-02-10T19:02:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b2b14c8d35241f7ce4b387319fca9c75a66e7a15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11145/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11145/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11145/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5cd4aa4915783981ea8c88ac7e55133dc2c958d8","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:take-ordered-and-project-fix","ref":"take-ordered-and-project-fix","sha":"5cd4aa4915783981ea8c88ac7e55133dc2c958d8","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

example code in mllib-feature-extraction.md using include_example\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13017\n\nThe example code in the user guide is embedded in the markdown and hence it is not easy to test. It would be nice to automatically test them. This JIRA is to discuss options to automate example code testing and see what we can do in Spark 1.6.\n\nGoal is to move actual example code to spark/examples and test compilation in Jenkins builds. Then in the markdown, we can reference part of the code to show in the user guide. This requires adding a Jekyll tag that is similar to https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/tags/include.rb, e.g., called include_example.\n`{% include_example scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/TFIDFExample.scala %}`\nJekyll will find `examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/TFIDFExample.scala` and pick code blocks marked \"example\" and replace code block in \n`{% highlight %}`\n in the markdown. \n\nSee more sub-tasks in parent ticket:

PR prototypes the `DataFrame`-to-`Dataset` migration.  It demonstrates main migration strategies but hasn't migrate all `DataFrame` methods.  Compilation/tests may break.\n\nGoals:\n1.  `Dataset` should have all operations of the original `DataFrame`\n2.  `DataFrame` is just a special `Dataset[Row]`\n3.  Source level compatibility whenever possible\n\nBasic strategies used:\n1.  Migrate all methods in `DataFrame` into `Dataset`\n2.  Migrate all methods in `GroupedData` into `GroupedDataset[K, V]` and then remove `GroupedData`\n3.  For all migrated untyped methods (typically those take `String`s and `Column`s as arguments), make them return `Row`, `Dataset[Row]`, or `GroupedDataset[Row, T]`.\n4.  Make `DataFrame` extend from `Dataset[Row]`\n   \n   Overrides untyped `Dataset` operations in `DataFrame` and make them return `DataFrame` instead of `Dataset[Row]`\n\nProblems encountered:\n1.  `DataFrame` RDD operations conflict with `Dataset` functional operations\n   \n   E.g.: `df.map` returns an RDD while `df.map` returns a `Dataset`.\n   \n   Possible solutions:\n   -   Remove `DataFrame` RDD operations since they can be easily mapped to methods of `df.rdd.\n     \n     Cons: breaks source level compatibility\n   -   Rename those `Dataset` methods\n     \n     Cons: may result inconsistent naming\n   \n   Personally I prefer the former option.\n2.  `Dataset` methods returning arrays can't be overriden in `DataFrame`\n   \n   E.g.: `Dataset.randomSplit` returns `Array[Dataset[T]]`.  We can't have an override version for `DataFrame` and make it return `Array[DataFrame]`.\n","created_at":"2016-02-09T17:57:45Z","updated_at":"2016-02-29T12:00:27Z","closed_at":"2016-02-29T12:00:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8502bad39998037bdb27b24073583177e7d98c43","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11137/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/11137/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/11137/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/558d003f6a939b5fcce79be922e8a2e60fea9dae","head":{"label":"liancheng:df-to-ds","ref":"df-to-ds","sha":"558d003f6a939b5fcce79be922e8a2e60fea9dae","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

example code in mllib-data-types.md using include_example\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13015\n\nThe example code in the user guide is embedded in the markdown and hence it is not easy to test. It would be nice to automatically test them. This JIRA is to discuss options to automate example code testing and see what we can do in Spark 1.6.\n\nGoal is to move actual example code to spark/examples and test compilation in Jenkins builds. Then in the markdown, we can reference part of the code to show in the user guide. This requires adding a Jekyll tag that is similar to https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/tags/include.rb, e.g., called include_example.\n`{% include_example scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/LocalVectorExample.scala %}`\nJekyll will find `examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/LocalVectorExample.scala` and pick code blocks marked \"example\" and replace code block in \n`{% highlight %}`\n in the markdown. \n\nSee more sub-tasks in parent ticket:

example code in mllib-pmml-model-export.md using include_example\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13018\n\nThe example code in the user guide is embedded in the markdown and hence it is not easy to test. It would be nice to automatically test them. This JIRA is to discuss options to automate example code testing and see what we can do in Spark 1.6.\n\nGoal is to move actual example code to spark/examples and test compilation in Jenkins builds. Then in the markdown, we can reference part of the code to show in the user guide. This requires adding a Jekyll tag that is similar to https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/lib/jekyll/tags/include.rb, e.g., called include_example.\n`{% include_example scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/PMMLModelExportExample.scala %}`\nJekyll will find `examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/mllib/PMMLModelExportExample.scala` and pick code blocks marked \"example\" and replace code block in \n`{% highlight %}`\n in the markdown. \n\nSee more sub-tasks in parent ticket:
