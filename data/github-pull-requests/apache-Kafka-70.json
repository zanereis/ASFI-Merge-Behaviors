When the preferred read replica is not the leader, the leader returns the preferred read replica with `FetchDataInfo(LogOffsetMetadata.UnknownOffsetMetadata, MemoryRecords.EMPTY)` to the `ReplicaManager`. This causes the fetch to go into in the fetch purgatory because the exit conditions are not met. In turns out that the delayed fetch is not completed until the timeout is reached because the delayed fetch ignores partition with an unknown offset (-1). If the fetch contains only one partition, the fetch is unnecessarily delayed by the timeout time (500ms by default) to only inform the consumer that it has to read from a follower.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the issue by completing the fetch request immediately when a preferred read replica is defined.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and

when in KRaft mode, CreateTopics did not return the active configurations for the\r\ntopic(s) it had just created. This PR addresses that gap. We will now return these topic\r\nconfiguration(s) when the user has DESCRIBE_CONFIGS permission. (In the case where the user does\r\nnot have this permission, we will omit the configurations and set TopicErrorCode. We will also omit\r\nthe number of partitions and replication factor data as well.)\r\n\r\nFor historical reasons, we use different names to refer to each topic configuration when it is set\r\nin the broker context, as opposed to the topic context.  For example, the topic configuration\r\n\"segment.ms\" corresponds to the broker configuration \"log.roll.ms\".  Additionally, some broker\r\nconfigurations have synonyms. For example, the broker configuration \"log.roll.hours\" can be used to\r\nset the log roll time instead of \"log.roll.ms\".  In order to track all of this, this PR adds a\r\ntable in LogConfig.scala which maps each topic configuration to an ordered list of ConfigSynonym\r\nclasses.  (This table is then passed to KafkaConfigSchema as a constructor argument.)\r\n\r\nSome synonyms require transformations. For example, in order to convert from \"log.roll.hours\" to\r\n\"segment.ms\", we must convert hours to milliseconds. (Note that our assumption right now is that\r\ntopic configurations do not have synonyms, only broker configurations. If this changes, we will\r\nneed to add some logic to handle it.)\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the 8-argument constructor for ConfigEntry public. We need this in order to make full\r\nuse of ConfigEntry outside of the admin namespace. This change is probably inevitable in general\r\nsince otherwise we cannot easily test the output from various admin APIs in junit tests outside the\r\nadmin package.\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds PlaintextAdminIntegrationTest#testCreateTopicsReturnsConfigs. This test validates\r\nsome of the configurations that it gets back from the call to CreateTopics, rather than just checking\r\nif it got back a non-empty map like some of the existing tests. In order to test the\r\nconfiguration override logic, testCreateDeleteTopics now sets up some custom static and dynamic\r\nconfigurations.\r\n\r\nIn QuorumTestHarness, we now allow tests to configure what the ID of the controller should be. This\r\nallows us to set dynamic configurations for the controller in testCreateDeleteTopics. We will have\r\na more complete fix for setting dynamic configuations on the controller later.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes ConfigurationControlManager so that it is created via a Builder. This will make it\r\neasier to add more parameters to its constructor without having to update every piece of test code\r\nthat uses it.  It will also make the test code easier to

race condition in `DynamicBrokerConfig` that can prevent configuration being dynamically applied when broker is running slowly.\r\n\r\nThe race condition occurs when multiple `alterBrokerConfigs` requests are being processed concurrently (but also seems to require the broker to be running under heavy load so that the request processing is slow enough for this issue to occur). Two or more separate threads can interact with the mutable buffer caching `Reconfigurable` objects inside `DynamicBrokerConfig`, and one thread may add a `Reconfigurable` to that buffer while another thread is iterating over it, causing the second thread to hit a `ConcurrentModificationException`.\r\n\r\nFirstly in `KafkaApis#handlerAlterConfigsRequest`, the [preprocess](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/52621613fd386203773ba93903abd50b46fa093a/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaApis.scala#L2633) method call ultimately reaches down into `DynamicBrokerConfig#processReconfiguration` to validate (and only validate) new settings. This validation process iterates over the reconfigurables, but does not modify the buffer.\r\n\r\nHowever, the `ConfigChangedNotificationHandler` that responds to config changes being stored in ZK, also [has a code path](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/81e709c4e2554f045a9961e520c0b7cc1a7b3495/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ZkConfigManager.scala#L125) that ultimately ends up in `DynamicBrokerConfig#processReconfiguration`, but unlike the `KafkaApis` code path, this one is actually applying config changes. \r\n\r\nSo while `KafkaApis` is iterating over the reconfigurables, `ConfigChangedNotificationHandler` can add a reconfigurable to the buffer, causing the concurrent modification exception. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*This race condition was made visible by an integration test `DynamicBrokerReconfigurationTest#testThreadPoolResize` which was originally considered flaky, as it repeatedly failed under the CI build, but passed locally. It had been temporarily disabled due to this perceived flakiness. The ideal approach to testing is to re-enable the integration test.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test

flaky `ConsumerBounceTest#testClose` test.\r\n\r\nIn this test, we tried to close the consumer, and then start another one, to make sure the new consumer will start to consume records from the previously committed offsets.\r\n\r\nWe intended to commit offsets before consumer close, to preserve the commit offsets. In https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/11340#discussion_r742512311 , we accidentally refactor it by commiting async during fixing another bug. If we commit async before close, we will send out a commit request without blocking the close process, and then, the request might fail sending to the broker due to client closed (connection is broken), which cause the commit never succeeded. \r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, we have to commit synchronously before closing the consumer.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

collected a list of the most flaky tests observed lately, checked / created their corresponding tickets, and mark them as ignored for now. Many of these failures are: \r\n\r\n0) Failing very frequently in the past (at least in my observations).\r\n1) not investigated for some time.\r\n2) have a PR for review (mostly thanks to @showuon !), but not reviewed for some time.\r\n\r\nSince 0), these tests failures are hindering our development; and from 1/2) above, people are either too busy to look after them, or honestly the tests are not considered as providing values since otherwise people should care enough to panic and try to resolve. So I think it's reasonable to disable all these tests for now. If we later learned our lesson a hard way, it would motivate us to tackle flaky tests more diligently as well.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

JVMs don't come with the `HmacSHA256` algorithm out of the box, but do come with other key generation and/or MAC algorithms. However, it's impossible at the moment to run Connect on such a JVM, because the defaults for the `inter.worker.*.algorithm` properties are validated during worker startup, and that validation includes a check to make sure that the algorithm in question is provided by the worker's JVM.\r\n\r\nTo address this, automatic validation using the `ConfigDef::Validator` interface is disabled and all KIP-507 [1] related config validation is moved into the `DistributedConfig` constructor, which allows validation to take place only for the algorithms that the worker is actually configured to use. Any of these algorithms may still be the default, but if not, the default will never be validated.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a bug in the logic for ensuring that a worker's signature algorithm is included in its list of verification algorithms is fixed. The existing logic checks to see if its **key generation** algorithm is included in the list of verification algorithms, which does not adhere to KIP-507 [1] (see docstring for the `inter.worker.verification.algorithms` property), and serves no practical purpose.\r\n\r\n[1] -

is possible to clean a segment partially if the offset map is filled before reaching the end of the segment. The highest offset that is reached becomes the new dirty offset after the cleaning completes. The data above this offset is nevertheless copied over to the new partially cleaned segment. Hence we need to ensure that the transaction index reflects aborted transactions from both the cleaned and uncleaned portion of the segment. Prior to this patch, this was not the case. We only collected the aborted transactions from the cleaned portion, which means that the reconstructed index could be incomplete. This can cause the aborted data to become effectively committed. It can also cause the deletion of the abort marker before the corresponding data has been removed (i.e. the aborted transaction becomes hanging).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from

from Jira):\r\n\r\nIn order to start a standalone Connect worker, it's currently necessary to provide at least two command-line arguments:\r\n\r\n- The path to the worker config file\r\n- One or more paths to a connector config file\r\n\r\nThis may be due to the now-inaccurate belief that standalone workers do not support the Connect REST API, which can be used to create/reconfigure/delete connectors at runtime. However, standalone mode does in fact expose the Connect REST API, and since that allows for connectors to be created after bringing up the worker, it is unnecessary to force users to supply at least one config for a connector to be run on the worker at startup time.\r\n\r\nThese changes remove that limitation from standalone mode, and update the Connect docs to be explicit about support for the REST API when running standalone.\r\n\r\nNo tests are added as the functional changes are trivial. I did perform an extremely rudimentary sanity check to ensure that, with these changes, a standalone worker could be brought up with just a worker config file and no connector configs, and a file sink connector could be created on that worker via the REST API after it finished startup.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-14T18:04:05Z","updated_at":"2022-11-30T16:49:33Z","closed_at":"2022-11-30T16:49:24Z","merged_at":"2022-11-30T16:49:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"548348c9e7823f2a9dcaacbd188f174f14b79d7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11890/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11890/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11890/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bec7aa5adf7f2cf25a0934fe9c01477c4138354f","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-13731","ref":"kafka-13731","sha":"bec7aa5adf7f2cf25a0934fe9c01477c4138354f","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

Description\r\n\r\nThe class `PushHttpMetricsReporter` no longer pushes metrics when network failure is recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nI debugged the code and found the problem here :\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/dc36dedd28ff384218b669de13993646483db966/tools/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/tools/PushHttpMetricsReporter.java#L214-L221\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen we submit a task to the `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` that needs to be executed periodically, if the task throws an exception and is not swallowed, the task will no longer be scheduled to execute.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nSo when an IO exception occasionally occurs on the network, we should swallow it rather than throw it in task `HttpReporter`.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-11T02:06:08Z","updated_at":"2022-03-21T00:57:49Z","closed_at":"2022-03-20T04:09:28Z","merged_at":"2022-03-20T04:09:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"6145974fef05cc212ad78a87505f930c47ba26e7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11879/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/11879/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/11879/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/7285f59559532b535a4163cf24185c16d964ab0c","head":{"label":"XiaoyiPeng:KAFKA-13728","ref":"KAFKA-13728","sha":"7285f59559532b535a4163cf24185c16d964ab0c","user":{"login":"XiaoyiPeng","id":8653312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8653312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng","html_url":"https://github.com/XiaoyiPeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197873620,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTc4NzM2MjA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"XiaoyiPeng/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XiaoyiPeng","id":8653312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2NTMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8653312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng","html_url":"https://github.com/XiaoyiPeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XiaoyiPeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XiaoyiPeng/kafka","description":"Mirror

test has started to become flaky at a relatively low, but consistently reproducible, rate. Upon inspection, we find this is due to IOExceptions during the #cleanUpNamedTopology call -- specifically, most often a `DirectoryNotEmptyException` with an ocasional` FileNotFoundException`\r\n\r\nBasically, signs pointed to having returned from/completed the `#removeNamedTopology` future prematurely, and moving on to try and clear out the topology's state directory while there was a streamthread somewhere that was continuing to process/close its tasks.\r\n\r\nI believe this is due to updating the thread's topology version _before_ we perform the actual topology update, in this case specifically the act of eg clearing out a directory. If one thread updates its version and then goes to perform the topology removal/cleanup when the second thread finishes its own topology removal, this other thread will check whether all threads are on the latest version and complete any waiting futures if so -- which means it can complete the future before the first thread has actually completed the corresponding
