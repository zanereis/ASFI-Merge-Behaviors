Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - [https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3069](https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3069)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe output of the process spawned by `S3FileTransformOperator` is not properly decoded, which makes reading logs rather difficult. Additionally, the `stderr` stream is only shown when process exit code is not equal to `0`.\r\n\r\nI would like to propose the following changes to `S3FileTransformOperator`:\r\n\r\n- Send both output streams (stdout & stderr) to the logger, regardless of the outcome (if any data is present)\r\n- Decode the output, so that new lines can be displayed correctly.\r\n- Include process exit code in the exception message, if the process fails.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI've added a separate case for testing `transform_script` with output present. Since logging is essential in this case, the test checks if a valid message was passed to the logging module. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3073\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`Adhoc queries` and `Charts` features are no longer supported in new FAB-based webserver and UI. But this is not mentioned at all in the doc \"Data Profiling\" (https://airflow.incubator.apache.org/profiling.html). This may confuse users.\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/UPDATING.md#breaking-changes\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a note to remind users for this.\r\n\r\nLater after the `www` is removed (completely migrated to `www_rbac`), this `profiling.rst` should be removed as well.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDocumentation chagne.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-17T02:05:40Z","updated_at":"2018-09-18T04:01:53Z","closed_at":"2018-09-18T03:59:13Z","merged_at":"2018-09-18T03:59:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f50083c8dfcd79ad569216a78b67f7568347628","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3909/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3909/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3909/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/115b3b3509858fb26ef88e510b04c63ce35575a4","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:add_note_for_profiling_doc","ref":"add_note_for_profiling_doc","sha":"115b3b3509858fb26ef88e510b04c63ce35575a4","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1195\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nLet's say that you had a task fail in a SubDag. You fix the underlying issue and want Airflow to resume the DagRun where it left off. If this were a flat DAG, then all you need to do is clear the failed TaskInstance and its downstream dependencies. The GUI will happily clear all of them for you in a single PUT request! In order to resume a SubDag, you must clear the TaskInstance + downstream dependencies AND you must clear the SubDagOperator + downstream depencies WITHOUT clearing its recursive dependencies. There should be an option to recursively clear task instances in parent SubDags.\r\n\r\nThe attached files use the example_subdag_operator DAG to illustrate the problem. Before the screenshot, I ran the operator to completion, then cleared example_subdag_operator.section-2.section-2-task-5. Notice that example_subdag_operator.section-2 is in the `running` state, but example_subdag_operator is still in the `success` state.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/45602518-bd6f4400-ba17-11e8-93af-7e1d9b80a9ee.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/45602520-bfd19e00-ba17-11e8-8bf6-a80092014294.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds this feature in airflow core, hence it is available in the CLI as well as both the UIs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n* `test_parentdag_downstream_clear`\r\n* In `test_dag_views`\r\n* `test_subdag_clear_parentdag_downstream_clear`\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

know how many data is being read from Postgres, it is nice to log\r\nthis to the Airflow log.\r\n\r\nPreviously when there was no data, it would still create a single file.\r\nThis is not something that we want, and therefore we've changed this\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nRefactored the tests to make use of Postgres itself since we have it\r\nrunning. This makes the tests more realistic, instead of mocking\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nReopen version of #3898 \r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3059\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3059\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-3059\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3067\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n**LATEST UPDATE**\r\n**Update `bootstrap-theme.css` instead, by adding `alert-message` and `alert-error` into it (rather than making too many changes in `www_rbac/views.py`).**\r\n\r\n**Background**\r\n\r\nFor **`www_rbac`**, the Flask flash messages are not categorized properly (ref: http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/flashing/#flashing-with-categories), then the default category would be '`message`'. Flask Appbuilder would assign CSS class `alert-[category]` to that message when displaying it (ref: https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/blob/master/flask_appbuilder/templates/appbuilder/flash.html).\r\n\r\n**Issue**\r\n\r\nBut CSS class '`alert-message`' is not specified in _bootstrap-theme.css_. This makes the the flash messages in the `www_rbac` UI come with no background color (please check the screenshots attached. We don't see this issue in `www` UI as all flash messages without categories are classed into 'info', and CSS class '`alert-info`' in available in _bootstrap-theme.css_).\r\n\r\nFor flash messages which are categorized as `'error'`, it would not work either since CSS class `alert-error` is not avaialbe in _bootstrap-theme.css_ as well. We can use category `danger` or `warning` instead.\r\n\r\nWe have this issue in 1.10.0 as well as master branch.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\n- Add proper category when we invoke **flash()**.\r\n- Available categories: 'success', 'info', 'warning', 'danger'.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots - Before**\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45587396-73af2c80-b937-11e8-864e-a19603ebfa02.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45587398-76aa1d00-b937-11e8-84aa-ef9a249fd4de.png\">\r\n\r\n**Screenshots - After**\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"3\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45587400-7ad63a80-b937-11e8-98ae-637d09304afc.png\">\r\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"4\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45587401-7d389480-b937-11e8-9a7e-b12f4598c333.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3048\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn the **www_rbac** app, at the top right corner, users can click to access \"**Profile**\" page, and in that page users are able to check their own profile, and further, they can change their own profile via **Edit User** (last and first name) and reset their OWN password (\"**Reset my password**\").\r\n\r\n**_`However, in the current version (both 1.10 and master branch), the default role-view-permission only allows Admin roles to access this page.`_** This is because non-Admin users don't have corresponding permissions to `UserDBModelView`, `UserInfoEditView`, and `ResetPasswordView`.\r\n\r\nOf course the Admin user can add access to these pages for other roles, but it should not be the case actually (it should be there by default. All users should be able to access their own profile and change their own profile as well as password).\r\n\r\n**Screenshot-1**\r\n<img width=\"1679\" alt=\"attachment 1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45432772-3d767080-b6dd-11e8-85d8-027de9e0e910.png\">\r\n\r\n**Screenshot-2**\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"attachment 2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45432778-40716100-b6dd-11e8-9736-8bfde65b71c1.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

So, when scheduler finds all tis of dagrun like this \"select * from task_instance where dag_id = 'some_id' and execution_date = '2018-09-01 ...'\", this query will be using ti_dag_state index (I was testing it in mysql workbench. I was expecting 'ti_state_lkp' but, it was not that case). Perhaps there's no problem when range of execution_date is small (under 1000 dagrun), but I had experienced slow allocation of tis when the dag had 1000+ accumulative dagrun.

Description ]\r\nThere was no index composed of dag_id and execution_date. So, when scheduler find all tis of dagrun like this \"select * from task_instance where dag_id = 'some_id' and execution_date = '2018-09-01 ...'\", this query will be using ti_dag_state index (I was testing it in mysql workbench. I was expecting 'ti_state_lkp' but, it was not that case). Perhaps there's no problem when range of execution_date is small (under 1000 dagrun), but I had experienced slow allocation of tis when the dag had 1000+ accumulative dagrun. So, now I was using airflow with adding new index ti_dag_date (dag_id, execution_date) on task_instance table.

loop is responsible for spinning up new DAG file processors after it harvested the results of DAG parsing. And thus the speed of new DAG file processor getting spinned up is bounded by the scheduler loop speed.

DAG parsing will be much faster and not longer bounded by scheduler loop speed. And thus scheduler will be able to schedule more tasks. Like this:\r\n![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/45280071-dd3ac100-b487-11e8-916b-c5789140f5a5.jpg)\r\n\r\nSummary of big behavior changes:\r\n\r\n1. Scheduler loop and DAG parsing loop are decoupled and run in two different processes.\r\n2. DAG parsing manager logging will go into a separate file.\r\n3. Zombie tasks will be calculate by DAG parsing manager and send to DAG parsing processor to kill. This is to reduce DB CPU load( identified to produce 80% of CPU load during stress test, CPU usage went down from 80%+ to ~40% after this change).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntest_dag_processing.py:TestDagFileProcessorAgent\r\njobs.py:SchedulerJobTest.test_no_orphan_process_will_be_left\r\nplan to add zombie detecting test in test_dag_processing.py\r\nThe change is more about doing same thing in different way and thus didn't add a lot unit tests. But I'm still thinking about proper unit tests to add, and suggestion on what unit tests to add would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nTested in our stress testing cluster with 4k files and 30k running tasks and scheduling delay has been kept within 5 mins( except when we need to scheduling huge amount of tasks at the time, which is going to be dealt with later) for 1+ month and our production cluster has been running with the change for 1+ week.\r\n\r\nBefore( #running tasks are lower because DB was stressed out and refusing connections, which caused tasks to fail):\r\n\r\nThe scheduling delay is generated by a monitoring task that is running on the cluster with 5m interval. It will compare the current timestamp against the expected scheduling timestamp(execution_date + 5m) and send the time diff in min as one data point on the metric graph, e.g. monitoring task with execution_date 2018-01-01T00:00:00 started at 2018-01-01T00:06:00 will put a 1m scheduling delay data point onto the metric graph.\r\n![screen shot 2018-07-31 at 12 23 52 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/45280411-16276580-b489-11e8-827e-8f3d2655983f.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![screen shot 2018-07-30 at 5 17 10 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/45280415-1aec1980-b489-11e8-9005-fec70db4a3d6.png)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Jira\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AIRFLOW/issues/AIRFLOW-2797\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn GCP, it is possible to create Dataproc cluster with a custom image that includes user's pre-installed packages. It significantly reduces the startup time of the cluster.\r\n\r\nFor more info see: https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/dataproc-images\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nTwo tests added:\r\n- one checks assertion in case someone passes both `image_version` & `custom_image` - such a situation does not make sense from the configuration perspective \r\n- one check if `imageUri` is correctly set in `cluster_data`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

reproduce:\r\n\r\ncreate email list variable as string and wait for sla miss\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- `EmailTest.test_get_email_address_comma_sep_string`\r\n- `EmailTest.test_get_email_address_colon_sep_string`\r\n- `EmailTest.test_get_email_address_list`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-09T17:29:52Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T08:41:14Z","closed_at":"2018-09-11T19:01:25Z","merged_at":"2018-09-11T19:01:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"1411245b17124cec495be2a105ed246e824d984b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/3869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/3869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/92c86f4a9356a0f499e051653dcc330d7e03e32e","head":{"label":"kaxil:AIRFLOW-3012-sla-email","ref":"AIRFLOW-3012-sla-email","sha":"92c86f4a9356a0f499e051653dcc330d7e03e32e","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThere are two issues found in documentation of command line interface\r\n\r\n**Issue 1**\r\n<img width=\"761\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-07 at 4 34 12 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/45207953-01e23d80-b2bc-11e8-92a7-d08e7d5c54bf.png\">\r\nThe default value of `--subdir` is generated dynamically, so Kaxil's Dag Folder during compiling is used in the final documentation (this appeared 14 times in https://airflow.apache.org/cli.html).

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3022\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdded `volumes` and `volume_mounts` to the KubernetesExecutorConfig so volumes or secrets can be mount to worker pod.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nAdded in `example_kubernetes_executor_config.py` which will be tested with `test_integration_run_dag ` and `test_integration_run_dag_with_scheduler_failure`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\nAdded a task to showcase the functionality.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3010\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3010\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-3010\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n   I just changed it so the Date datatype would be acknowledged in write and read.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nCurrently the schema functionality is largely untested and this would be a larger undertaking if we wanted to create better testing for serialization.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ X ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-05T14:04:35Z","updated_at":"2019-03-29T10:46:21Z","closed_at":"2019-01-10T22:49:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8b9bc73173e972162c2ca335c697149040ceb59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3008\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3008\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-3008\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nKubeternetes executor and operators are a part of contrib folder, hence the associated example DAGs should also move to `airflow/contrib/example_dags` instead of `airflow/example_dags`. This would also solve the issue of unncessary logs that inform installing k8s dependencies when examples are turned on in `airflow.cfg`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3003\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3003\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-3003\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Description ]\r\nThere was no index composed of dag_id and execution_date. So, when scheduler find all tis of dagrun like this \"select * from task_instance where dag_id = 'some_id' and execution_date = '2018-09-01 ...'\", this query will be using ti_dag_state index (I was testing it in mysql workbench. I was expecting 'ti_state_lkp' but, it was not that case). Perhaps there's no problem when range of execution_date is small (under 1000 dagrun), but I had experienced slow allocation of tis when the dag had 1000+ accumulative dagrun. So, now I was using airflow with adding new index ti_dag_date (dag_id, execution_date) on task_instance table.

This allows subsequent queries to be optimised, and the volume of data queried (and hence cost) potentially reduced when filtering on clustered fields.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for clustering to the bigquery hook, bigquery query operator and GCS to bigquery load operator.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTests are added for the run and load operations on the bigquery hook. The operator changes consist of merely passing through a single option to the hook.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2965\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR is to address the request proposed by JIRA user Jack , in JIRA ticket [2965](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2965).\r\n@r39132 suggested a PR in this ticket.\r\n\r\nThis new CLI tool can help show the next execution datetime, given DAG id. Under the hood, its checking the following schedule of the latest execution datetime.\r\n\r\nLet's say I have DAG `basic_dag` whose schedule_interval is `*/2 * * * *`. The latest execution_date is 2018-08-31 10:36:00 (start time is 2018-08-31 10:38:00).\r\n\r\nIf I run this new CLI tool `airflow next_execution basic_dag`, the result would be \r\n<img width=\"855\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-02 at 10 29 05 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/44957068-ef54b680-aeff-11e8-831d-9319b85135d2.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter I change the schedule_interval to `0 23 * * *` and run the same command again, the result is \r\n<img width=\"868\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-02 at 10 30 02 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/44957070-f8de1e80-aeff-11e8-9785-87ffaf2e74ce.png\">\r\n**(actual start time would be 2018-09-01 23:00:00)**\r\n\r\nAgain, we change the scheduler_interval to `0 3 * * *`, the result is \r\n<img width=\"876\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-02 at 10 30 42 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/44957071-faa7e200-aeff-11e8-83a1-f25a008394ac.png\">\r\n**(actual start time would be 2018-09-02 03:00:00)**\r\n\r\nRunning with `-h` would return the usage and arguments needed.\r\n<img width=\"662\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-09-02 at 10 36 14 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11539188/44957110-a2251480-af00-11e8-97df-cd8077c6ba76.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2981\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe `GoogleCloudBucketHelper.google_cloud_to_local` function attempts to compare a list to an int, resulting in the TypeError, with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\npath_components = file_name[self.GCS_PREFIX_LENGTH:].split('/')\r\nif path_components < 2:\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- `GoogleCloudBucketHelperTest. test_invalid_object_path`\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2156) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2156\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis change is mostly authored by @aoen. I am merely doing the tests/small fix and PR publishing due to job change of him.\r\n\r\nThe change would bring Airflow to meet 5 min scheduling SLA with 30k running tasks according to Airbnb production traffic and stress tests. The performance of the celery querying step is hugely improved by 15x+ with 16 processors and can potentially be fast with more processors( checkout our stress test results below).\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe scheduling delay is generated by a monitoring task that is running on the cluster with 5m interval. It will compare the current timestamp against the expected scheduling timestamp(execution_date + 5m) and send the time diff in min as one data point on the metric graph, e.g. monitoring task with execution_date 2018-01-01T00:00:00 started at 2018-01-01T00:06:00 will put a 1m scheduling delay data point onto the metric graph.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2018-06-13 at 12 01 17 am copy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/44940493-2bdbb300-ad44-11e8-943c-c3d2d3c5907b.png)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1586\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-06-15 at 12 40 18 am copy\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7818710/44940495-36964800-ad44-11e8-9a4a-3ff7790d14a9.png\">\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nSyncing no longer happens at the end of the celery executor executions (e.g. if scheduler shuts down). The sync does not actually guarantee that tasks finished anyways and prolongs the ending protocol.\r\nThere is no timeout on the subprocesses but that wasn't the case before this change either\r\nWhat about logging for the multiprocessing tasks? Well it's ok to skip them, they aren't currently logged either.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\ntests/executors/test_celery_executor.py:CeleryExecutorTest.test_exception_propagation\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2985\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently we don't have an operator in Airflow to help copy objects within S3, while this is a quite common use case when we deal with the data in S3.\r\n\r\nUnder the hood, this operator is using `boto3.client.copy_object()`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTest case has been added\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2983\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSimilar to https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3418, but introduce two nodash macros:\r\n{{ prev_ds_nodash }}: the previous execution date as {{ YYYYMMDD }}\r\n{{ next_ds_nodash }}: the next execution date as {{ YYYYMMDD }}\r\n\r\nWe introduced prev_ds and next_ds in https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/3418 which is beneficial for backfill.  By using these two macros, we could override the schedule_internal from daily to certain days(e.g 7 days) in backfill through ```--conf``` option. \r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8
