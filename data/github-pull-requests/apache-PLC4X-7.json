These methods update the original DOM, as well as the Elements list.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2017\">jhy/jsoup#2017</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the NodeIterator class, to efficiently traverse a node tree using the Iterator interface. And\nadded Stream Element#stream() and Node#nodeStream() methods, to enable fluent composable stream pipelines of node\ntraversals.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2051\">jhy/jsoup#2051</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when changing the OutputSettings syntax to XML, the xhtml EscapeMode is automatically set by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the <code>:is(selector list)</code> pseudo-selector, which finds elements that match any of the selectors in\nthe selector list. Useful for making large ORed selectors more readable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: repackaged the library with native (vs automatic) JPMS module support.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2025\">jhy/jsoup#2025</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: better fidelity of source positions when tracking is enabled. And implicitly created or closed elements\nare tracked and detectable via Range.isImplicit().\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2056\">jhy/jsoup#2056</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when source tracking is enabled, the source position for attribute names and values is now available.\nAttribute#sourceRange() provides the ranges.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2057\">jhy/jsoup#2057</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when running concurrently under Java 21+ Virtual Threads, virtual threads could be pinned to their\ncarrier platform thread when parsing an input stream. To improve performance, particularly when parsing fetched\nURLs, the internal ConstrainableInputStream has been replaced by ControllableInputStream, which avoids the locking\nwhich caused that pinning.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2054\">jhy/jsoup#2054</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Jsoup.Connect, allow any XML mimetype as a supported mimetype.

is rather small change but it adjusts initialization sequence of driver needed by #1007 and present until 0.10 (and most of v0.11 prior release). \r\n\r\nI did rebase #1007 changes and had to fix this part. Given that this is part of SPI I would like to separate it.

Evaluators\nare sorted by their relative execution cost, and executed in order of lower to higher cost. This speeds the\nmatching process by ensuring that simpler evaluations (such as a tag name match) are conducted prior to more\ncomplex evaluations (such as an attribute regex, or a deep child scan with a :has).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added support for <!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tags (and their children). This includes tag namespaces and case\npreservation on applicable tags and attributes.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2008\">jhy/jsoup#2008</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, HTML documents will be placed in the\n<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace by default, per the HTML5 spec. This can be controlled by setting\n<code>W3CDom#namespaceAware(false)</code>.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1848\">jhy/jsoup#1848</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: speed optimized the Structural Evaluators by memoizing previous evaluations. Particularly the <code>~</code>\n(any preceding sibling) and <code>:nth-of-type</code> selectors are improved.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1956\">jhy/jsoup#1956</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tweaked the performance of the Element nextElementSibling, previousElementSibling, firstElementSibling,\nlastElementSibling, firstElementChild, and lastElementChild. They now inplace filter/skip in the child-node list, vs\nhaving to allocate and scan a complete Element filtered list.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: optimized internal methods that previously called Element.children() to use filter/skip child-node list\naccessors instead, reducing new Element List allocations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tweaked the performance of parsing :pseudo selectors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when using the <code>:empty</code> pseudo-selector, blank textnodes are now considered empty. Previously,\nan element containing any whitespace was not considered empty.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1976\">jhy/jsoup#1976</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in forms, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> should be excluded from formData() (and hence from form submissions).\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/2010\">jhy/jsoup#2010</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Safelist, made isSafeTag and isSafeAttribute public methods, for extensibility.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1780\">jhy/jsoup#1780</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: <code>form</code> elements and empty elements (such as <code>img</code>) did not have their attributes de-duplicated.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1950\">jhy/jsoup#1950</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if Document.OutputSettings was cloned from a clone, an NPE would be thrown when used.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1964\">jhy/jsoup#1964</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: in Jsoup.connect(url), URL paths containing a %2B were incorrectly recoded to a '+', or a '+' was recoded\nto a ' '. Fixed by reverting to the previous behavior of not encoding supplied paths, other than normalizing to\nASCII.\n<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1952\">jhy/jsoup#1952</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

OPC-UA messages contain a sequence number, which is independent from the normal TCP sequence numbers. This sequence number is checked by the server, that may refuse to respond, if the sequence number is lower than the last received message's. Packetization itself happens asynchronously in netty, some time after `writeAndFlush(msg)` has been invoked by the application code. If there are concurrent calls to this function, there is no guarantee that messages are packeted in the same order as they have been added to `writeAndFlush(msg)`. This, in some cases, can cause OPC-UA messages being delivered to the server in different order, than it is specified by their sequence numbers, and the server may drop these messages, and the client eventually times out.\r\n\r\nAs TCP guarantees delivering packets in the correct order, a trival solution is to simply wait for packetization to complete, before adding the next message to the pipeline.\r\n\r\nBut yet comes a design problem: OPC-UA response handlers were written in a way, that they may send new messages, while processing the response. These handlers are executed on the netty event loop thread, which is shared among all Netty I/O operations, such as receiving/sending messages. This essentially means, that if a response handler is currently being executed, you cannot start packetizing a new message, because that would require the response handler to finish, which is waiting for guess what, the packetization to complete.\r\n\r\nSolution to this is to execute response handlers asynchronously, so they don't occupy the Netty event handler thread.\r\n\r\nThis commit also fixes the `OpcuaPlcDriverTest` flakyness, experienced after https://github.com/apache/plc4x/pull/1139 had been merged.\r\n\r\nSee also:

directly. This may address <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6657\">&quot;Could not find <code>some-dependency</code>&quot; errors</a> that some users have reported (which might be a result of users' excluding <code>guava-parent</code>). (c6d35cf1a5)</li>\n<li><code>collect</code>: Changed <code>Multisets.unmodifiableMultiset(set).removeIf(predicate)</code> to throw an exception always, even if nothing matches <code>predicate</code>. (61dbccfda3)</li>\n<li><code>graph</code>: Fixed the behavior of <code>Graph</code>/<code>ValueGraph</code> views for a node when that node is removed from the graph. (950799691c)</li>\n<li><code>io</code>: Fixed <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> under <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6634\">Windows <em>services</em>, a rare use case</a>. (The fix actually covers only Java 9+ because Java 8 would require an additional approach. Let us know if you need support under Java 8.) (f87f68cd3e)</li>\n<li><code>net</code>: Made <code>MediaType.parse</code> allow and skip over whitespace around the <code>/</code> and <code>=</code> separator tokens in addition to the <code>;</code> separator, for which it was already being allowed. (2786f83291)</li>\n<li><code>util.concurrent</code>: Tweaked <code>Futures.getChecked</code> constructor-selection behavior: The method continues to prefer to call constructors with a <code>String</code> parameter, but now it breaks ties based on whether the constructor has a <code>Throwable</code> parameter. Beyond that, the choice of constructor remains undefined. (For this and other reasons, we discourage the use of <code>getChecked</code>.)
