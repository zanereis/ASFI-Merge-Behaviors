PR introduces the use of convolution weights on buffers rather than textures. \r\n\r\n- For now, the weights on the buffers are used only in the fp32 case since that case is investigated \r\n- Also, the case of 1x1 convolutions is excluded from this approach, since the weights on the buffers work worse in this case\r\n- This approach gives about 10% performance boost for popular models, such as: vgg-16, yolov3,

the FFI would automatically convert all instances of `tvm::runtime::DataType` to a string for FFI usage.  This was an unnecessary step of formatting/parsing to every FFI call with `tvm::runtime::DataType` arguments, and resulted in duplicate parsing/formatting implementations in C++ and Python.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the FFI to pass `tvm::runtime::DataType` directly, using the existing `TVMArgTypeCode::kTVMDataType` type code.  The `tvm.DataType` wrapper class is updated with additional methods for backwards compatibility (e.g. `\"float\" in dtype`, `bits = int(dtype[-2:])`), which can be phased out over time.","created_at":"2022-12-02T14:57:52Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T18:10:55Z","closed_at":"2024-05-23T18:10:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"472e4c2f9dd16229e4e9194346cb35f582c5235d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13539/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13539/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13539/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/ff2f8f0c1b53dff0608fa9ba1beb3b4f9913a512","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:datatype_ffi","ref":"datatype_ffi","sha":"ff2f8f0c1b53dff0608fa9ba1beb3b4f9913a512","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, floating point expressions were used to map between different-sized pixel arrays.  These floating point expressions are less aggressively optimized by `RewriteSimplifier`, which can prevent some optimizations\r\n\r\nThis was first noticed during investigation into issue #13508. Benchmarks of `topi.image.resize` showed 1000x and 50x performance improvements using the LLVM and CUDA backends, respectively, by using integer expressions instead of floating point.  This performance improvement is partly driven by enabling\r\n`tir.transform.VectorizeLoops` to recognize vectorizable indices, where the round-trip through floating point previously prevented that optimization.","created_at":"2022-12-01T16:07:41Z","updated_at":"2024-09-12T18:37:49Z","closed_at":"2024-09-12T18:37:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"57d6ca5fc1d43ebe9057902003baeff72e70b860","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13530/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/13530/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/13530/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/dc07d5d166e8798eb3754818e79f6f5c53e0d885","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:topi_resize_performance_investigation","ref":"topi_resize_performance_investigation","sha":"dc07d5d166e8798eb3754818e79f6f5c53e0d885","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

a `tir.Simplify` pass, these extensions were conditionally enabled based on the `PassContext`.  Prior to this commit, they were enabled by default in the `tir.RemoveNoOp` pass, as the simplified expressions were only used to prove/disprove a no-op, and did not appear in the output TIR.  However, this caused performance issues for some nested boolean expressions.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables the analyzer extensions for the analyzer used by `tir.RemoveNoOp`.  The extensions are still used internally by `ControlFlowGraph`, including during the data-flow analysis used if `tir.transform.RemoveNoOpConfig.use_dataflow_analysis` is enabled, so the opt-in data-dependent no-op removals are unaffected.\r\n\r\nRelated to issue

the `export_module` function assumes that the module and all imported modules have the same `type_key`. If we have a host llvm module and some imported c modules, it may fail to set the `llvm_target_string` and `object_format` correctly, and thus fail to continue with the llvm build flow.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I set the object format of a mixed-type module to that of the host module, and always set `llvm_target_string` when we see a host llvm module.\r\n\r\ncc: @tqchen @YuchenJin

int32. The dtypes of `initial_indices` in `IndexMap` are fixed to int32 (see below), this is in conflict with the above PR which made the dtypes of buffer shapes int64.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/458ca81c01bd85d04ea6428e7cb4bfa021a1d37a/src/tir/ir/index_map.cc#L51\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/78b53221f8dd8c1d2bbeff9d34803db33ca254dd/python/tvm/tir/function.py#L395\r\n\r\nSince `initial_indices` is used everywhere to construct `loop_var` / `iter_var` / `iter_values` of `For` and `Block` etc, I'm adding a dtype legalization at the beginning of `TransformLayout`, when the

PR fixes the behavior of IndexDataTypeNormalizer on CastNode.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nConsider the following case,\r\n```python\r\nA = te.placeholder((tir.IntImm(\"int64\", 2), tir.IntImm(\"int64\", 4)), name=\"A\")\r\nB = topi.reshape(A, (4, 2))\r\nfunc = te.create_prim_func([A, B], index_dtype_override=None)\r\n```\r\nthe generated PrimFunc is\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(A: T.Buffer[(T.int64(2), T.int64(4)), \"float32\"], T_reshape: T.Buffer[(4, 2), \"float32\"]):\r\n    for i0, i1 in T.grid(4, 2):\r\n        with T.block(\"T_reshape\"):\r\n            ax0, ax1 = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i0, i1])\r\n            T.reads(A[(T.Cast(\"int64\", ax0) * T.int64(2) + T.Cast(\"int64\", ax1)) % T.int64(8) // T.int64(4), (T.Cast(\"int64\", ax0) * T.int64(2) + T.Cast(\"int64\", ax1)) % T.int64(4)])\r\n            T.writes(T_reshape[ax0, ax1])\r\n            T_reshape[ax0, ax1] = A[(T.Cast(\"int64\", ax0) * T.int64(2) + T.Cast(\"int64\", ax1)) % T.int64(8) // T.int64(4), (T.Cast(\"int64\", ax0) * T.int64(2) + T.Cast(\"int64\", ax1)) % T.int64(4)]\r\n```\r\nHere loop variables `ax0` and `ax1` have dtype int32, since the shape of the output buffer is in int32. Other other hand, the input buffer has shape in int64. So as the script above shows, CreatePrimFunc will cast the int32 variables to int64 first, and access the input buffer afterwards.\r\n\r\nNow if we use the option `index_dtype_override` to specify an index dtype as below,\r\n```python\r\nfunc = te.create_prim_func([A, B], index_dtype_override=\"int64\")\r\n```\r\nthe generated function will be\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef func(A: T.Buffer[(T.int64(2), T.int64(4)), \"float32\"], T_reshape: T.Buffer[(T.int64(4), T.int64(2)), \"float32\"]):\r\n    for i0, i1 in T.grid(T.int64(4), T.int64(2)):\r\n        with T.block(\"T_reshape\"):\r\n            ax0, ax1 = T.axis.remap(\"SS\", [i0, i1])\r\n            T.reads(A[(T.Cast(\"int64\", ax0) * T.int64(2) + T.Cast(\"int64\", ax1)) % T.int64(8) // T.int64(4), (T.Cast(\"int64\", ax0) * T.int64(2) + T.Cast(\"int64\", ax1)) % T.int64(4)])\r\n            T.writes(T_reshape[ax0, ax1])\r\n            T_reshape[ax0, ax1] = A[(T.Cast(\"int64\", ax0) * T.int64(2) + T.Cast(\"int64\", ax1)) % T.int64(8) // T.int64(4), (T.Cast(\"int64\", ax0) * T.int64(2) + T.Cast(\"int64\", ax1)) % T.int64(4)]\r\n```\r\nNote that though all variables and the buffer shapes have dtype int64, there are still CastNodes such as `T.Cast(\"int64\", ax0)` when `ax0` is already an int64 variable. We don’t want such redundant casting.\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue above, this PR overrides the `VisitExpr_(const CastNode* cast)` method in IndexDataTypeNormalizer. When the `value` field of a CastNode already has the target dtype, we no longer cast it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\ncc @vinx13 @junrushao

PR brings 2 bug fixes:\r\n1. ONNX converter for matmul: ONNX matmul follows NumPy [rules](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html):\r\n> If the first argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by prepending a 1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the prepended 1 is removed.\r\n> If the second argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by appending a 1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the appended 1 is removed.\r\n\r\nThe (my) previous fix https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/11174 did not consider the second rule (append 1 dimension for the rhs vector).\r\n\r\n2. Relay's `nn.matmul` takes 2-D matrices and the checker was removed in a recent PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/13287. This PR puts the checker back to prevent process crashes (make it a readable TVMError) for readability (and also for that the CI in https://github.com/ise-uiuc/nnsmith/pull/64 won't be terminated
