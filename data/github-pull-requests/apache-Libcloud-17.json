in.\n","created_at":"2014-01-17T13:21:02Z","updated_at":"2014-01-17T14:40:52Z","closed_at":"2014-01-17T14:40:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2a25e19095eb7b2217d5da550a08b544ff53a103","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/8d5d905af5e3406c6c413eeca4602c559ca39941","head":{"label":"wrigri:External_IP_Support","ref":"External_IP_Support","sha":"8d5d905af5e3406c6c413eeca4602c559ca39941","user":{"login":"wrigri","id":4119885,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMTk4ODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4119885?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri","html_url":"https://github.com/wrigri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wrigri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"c677de3093118dbd33b3077afb3cc34009386d91","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":419555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTk1NTU=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"apache/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud","description":"Apache

addresses two issues I filed ([LIBCLOUD-497](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-497), [LIBCLOUD-498](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-498)).\n\nIt adds:\n- ACL override support for S3 via `extra={'acl': '...'}`\n- Support for a `token=` keyword argument on S3 driver (and can be easily added to other AWS drivers) to include the AWS Security Token param/header, which is required when using IAM role-provider credentials or other temporary AS credentials.\n- Makes `get_container` on S3 no longer call `list_containers` and otherwise work correctly in an environment with highly restricted permissions.

following errors:\n- Base driver shouldn't have any ex_ methods\n- Base driver shouldn't have any methods with ex_arguments\n- Driver implementation shouldn't have methods that aren't defined in the base driver, unless prefixed by ex_\n- If a base driver method accepts an argument then a driver implementation should accept that argument\n- A driver implementation shouldn't accept any additional arguments that aren't prefixed with ex_\n\nThis has 70 matches - though a lot are false positives because `create_node` uses kwargs for things like image, size, etc. I don't really like that it does that...\n\nBut there are real matches - should ec2's list_snapshot be ex_list_snapshot for example.\n","created_at":"2013-12-27T17:24:42Z","updated_at":"2015-11-23T23:41:21Z","closed_at":"2015-11-23T23:41:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e586acb32c6271f14b51cbc2c7fbc1430948c09b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/2fc78400ff6114cca91b366344cc7f731db82ffa","head":{"label":"Jc2k:lint","ref":"lint","sha":"2fc78400ff6114cca91b366344cc7f731db82ffa","user":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":1917628,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTE3NjI4","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Jc2k/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Jc2k","id":11544,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11544?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k","html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Jc2k/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Jc2k/libcloud","description":"Mirror

pull request promotes key pair management functionality to be part of the base compute API as discussed on the mailing list.\n\nIt includes the following changes:\n- Add new `KeyPair` class in `libcloud.compute.base` module\n- Add new key pair management methods to `libcloud.compute.base.NodeDriver` class\n- Update existing drivers which previously exposed this functionality through the extension methods (EC2, CloudStack, OpenStack) to use a new standard API\n- For backward compatibility reasons and to ease the migration, existing extension methods will continue to work until a next major release (existing extension methods have been modified to call new methods which are now part of the standard API).\n- Add some missing tests (while working on this I have noticed there were some missing or bad tests for the key pair management functionality)\n- Update upgrade nodes section in the documentation\n- Add a new section on how to use key pair management to the documentation\n\nOnly which currently exposes key pair management through extension methods and I haven't updated is NephoScale. The reason for that is that NephoScale offers two types of keys (password and ssh) and I haven't totally decided yet what I want to do with it.\n","created_at":"2013-12-07T12:42:08Z","updated_at":"2014-06-12T19:07:20Z","closed_at":"2013-12-10T21:27:02Z","merged_at":"2013-12-10T21:27:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"690f29d21b0c3e75d49b2b02cc35afd183a712d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/22f0432dedeeb5701ba145d0acebff9907946b6e","head":{"label":"Kami:promote_key_pair_management_to_base_compute_api","ref":"promote_key_pair_management_to_base_compute_api","sha":"22f0432dedeeb5701ba145d0acebff9907946b6e","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

branch fixes an issue described in LIBCLOUD-436 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-428).\n\nAs noted in the ticket description, the problem is that current version of code doesn't properly check if the token has expired before using it. This causes `InvalidCredsError` exception to be thrown if the token has expired. \n\nThis is usually a non-issue for short running scripts, but if you are using a driver in a long running process, there is a bigger chance that the token will expire during the life-time of the process and as such, the exception will be thrown. \n\nWhile working on this bug, I also discovered an issue with `ex_force_auth_token` argument. Currently we support skipping the authentication process by passing a valid auth token to the driver constructor using `ex_force_auth_token` argument.\n\nThe problem is that we don't know about the token expiration time when this argument is used. Ss such, we can't invalidate the token when it's about to expire. My solution to this problem was documenting this behavior better in the documentation.\n\nAs you can see in the diff, I also needed to update the fixtures for tests to pass.

emits warnings for names that are imported but not used. In most cases, these either look like copy/pasted import blocks, or names left in from debugging or after refactoring. Common unused names are the `sys` or `time` modules, and base classes. Some modules were doing an import dance to get `simplejson` or standard `json`, but those modules no longer parse json directly, likely as the result of refactoring it to a lower level.\n\nThe `libcloud.utils.py3` module contains a lot of these unused imports, but that's intentional. Because of that, it includes a `flake8: noqa` comment near the top of the file to tell `flake8` to ignore it.\n","created_at":"2013-10-25T18:55:14Z","updated_at":"2013-10-25T20:57:20Z","closed_at":"2013-10-25T20:57:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86b89885ad5888c800d64e7a17606f9bcffe0fbb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/088615f0a91dfd8200d9ad9546d5840cda5a8937","head":{"label":"briancurtin:import_cleanup","ref":"import_cleanup","sha":"088615f0a91dfd8200d9ad9546d5840cda5a8937","user":{"login":"briancurtin","id":390955,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MDk1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/390955?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin","html_url":"https://github.com/briancurtin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/briancurtin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"e790601f9969e4a51247ca5184546eba6e93e196","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":419555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTk1NTU=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"apache/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud","description":"Apache
