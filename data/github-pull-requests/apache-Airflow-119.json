Sagemaker System Test is flaky and fails occasionally because Reasons.  This change greatly reduces the frequency of the failures.  \r\n\r\n**Long version:**\r\nThe Sagemaker Tuning Job fails from time to time, partially because the test is being run on a small dataset for the sake of time and resources.  The tuning task will only fail if every retry of the tuning job fails.  Previously increasing MaxNumberOfTrainingJobs from 1 to 2 reduced failure rate from roughly 50% of the time down to roughly failing once every 7 runs.  After increasing it from 2 to 10 I have run this text 60 times locally and it failed only one of those.  10 is the largest value allowed by the API.  Since we are automatically running the tests internally now on AWS infrastructure, we can afford to throw a little more compute power behind it to get the tests passing more reliably.","created_at":"2022-12-14T22:34:15Z","updated_at":"2022-12-14T22:41:45Z","closed_at":"2022-12-14T22:41:45Z","merged_at":"2022-12-14T22:41:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"fbbd453d27fc9c6ac93f68de9e083ca684bec562","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1987146877,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg3MTQ2ODc3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:system-tests","name":"area:system-tests","color":"ffdacc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/28368/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/28368/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/28368/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/3e89647147b32609482ee5fa0524db2e959d4ec7","head":{"label":"aws-mwaa:ferruzzi/sagemaker-tuning-fix","ref":"ferruzzi/sagemaker-tuning-fix","sha":"3e89647147b32609482ee5fa0524db2e959d4ec7","user":{"login":"aws-mwaa","id":101427443,"node_id":"O_kgDOBguo8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101427443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa","html_url":"https://github.com/aws-mwaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":484591340,"node_id":"R_kgDOHOJG7A","name":"upstream-to-airflow","full_name":"aws-mwaa/upstream-to-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aws-mwaa","id":101427443,"node_id":"O_kgDOBguo8w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101427443?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa","html_url":"https://github.com/aws-mwaa","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aws-mwaa/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aws-mwaa/upstream-to-airflow","description":"Apache

Path.mkdirs, If mode is given, it is combined with the process’ umask value to determine the file mode and access flags. if parents is true, any missing parents of this path are created as needed; they are created with the default permissions without taking mode into account. However, in the `mkdirs`, it specifies the `umask` is ignored\r\n\r\nThis `mkdirs` was replaced by `Path(xx).mkdir` in the current codebase, e.g. https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/b263dbcb0f84fd9029591d1447a7c843cb970f15/airflow/utils/log/file_task_handler.py#L345. \r\n\r\nBut I think we should use `mkdirs`, as the `Path(xx).mkdir` does not set the mode correctly, since it factors in the `umask` , see this code:\r\n\r\ne.g. code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nfrom tempfile import TemporaryDirectory\r\nfrom uuid import uuid4\r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\n\r\nwith TemporaryDirectory() as tmpdir:\r\n    path = os.path.join(tmpdir, str(uuid4()), str(uuid4()))\r\n    Path(path).mkdir(mode=0o777, parents=True, exist_ok=True)\r\n    mode = oct(os.stat(path).st_mode)[-3:]\r\n    print('mode is', mode) \r\n    assert mode == \"777\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output is :`mode is, 755`, which is not `777`\r\n\r\nsee: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.Path.mkdir\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

now `DockerHook` only partially uses in `DockerOperator` and `DockerSwarmOperator`.\r\n\r\nThis PR refactor some parts\r\n1. Drop raising errors for most of the missing arguments during constructing hook. In Docker SDK all of them optional.\r\n2. Move out all expensive call from `__init__`, e.g. obtain connection.\r\n3. `docker_conn_id` now optional. If user not required login to docker Registry this field might be set to None.\r\nPreviously this functional sits in `DockerOperator`\r\n4. Cache connection to docker server/host.\r\n5. Move out constructing TLSConfig from `DockerOperator` to `DockerHook`\r\n\r\nThis kind of integration will allow in the future move all complex logic from Operators to Hook and make them reusable.\r\n\r\nAlso this PR pre-requirements for

comes from the discussion in https://github.com/apache/airflow/discussions/28253\r\n\r\n> Currently the behavior for a DAG which depends on multiple DataSets is to be executed only when all datasets have been updated since the last DAG execution. This feature would enable a DAG to run every time any of the multiple DataSets change.\r\n>\r\n> The motivation is to allow better traceability of changes in a derived dataset, being able to track down changes along all the DAGs chain for every change in every dataset.\r\n>\r\n\r\nThis adds a new field to the DAG and DagModel to allow for a DAG to be scheduled anytime any of it's datasets passed in the schedule field is updated, instead of waiting for all datasets to be updated.\r\n\r\nStill to do:\r\n\r\n - [ ] pass community review\r\n - [x] update the UI to remove the \"x of y

I have also updated the docs and system tests for this new operator. \r\n\r\nI have also added a few more tests in the `tests/providers/ftp/operators` directory. Because the only difference between the `FTPFileTransmitOperator` and `FTPSFileTransmitOperator` is the use of the `FTPSHook` (as opposed to the `FTPHook`), I only added unit tests that tested the

psycopg dependency is slightly more optimized than than the binary one, but the problems it creates when it is used as dependency are numerous - it always expects to compile the psycopg dependencies, so you cannot install it when there are no build-essentials installed and on some systems additional libraries are needed.\r\n\r\nWe introduced it in #25710 for optimisation reasons.\r\n\r\nHowever, the optimisations it brings are not really justified with the installation complexities it introduces, that's why we revert it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

needs to monkeypatch a number of system libraries as soon as possible when Python interpreter starts, in order to avoid other libraries monkey-patching them before. We should do it before any other initialization and it needs to be only run on webserver.\r\n\r\nSo far it was done by local_settings monkeypatching but that has been rather brittle and some changes in Airflow made previous attempts to stop working because the \"other\" packages could be loaded by Airflow before - depending on installed providers and configuration (for example when you had AWS configured as logger, boto could have been loaded before and it could have monkey patch networking before gevent had a chance to do so.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces different mechanism of triggering the patching - it could be triggered by setting an environment variable. This has the benefit that we do not need to initialize anything (including reading settings or setting up logging) before we determine if gevent patching should be performed.\r\n\r\nIt has also the drawback that the user will have to set the environment variable in their deployment manually. However this is a small price to pay if they will get a stable and future-proof gevent monkeypatching built-in in Airflow.\r\n\r\nFixes: #8212\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

issue [#27979](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/27979)\r\n\r\n`EmrAddStepsOperator` doesn't kill the step on EMR when a clear is called on UI. Unlike other operators where process gets killed once clear is called, here, nothing is affected to the step on EMR, stays in the same state.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, before a new step is added or when clear is called, if pre-existing step is already in RUNNING/PENDING state, its marked for cancel from EMR list of steps. It will instantaneously makes the cluster available to run current step and wouldn't keep on waiting for existing step to finish\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

a follow up after #28047, this PR will make the test cleanup more robust and resilient to any errors that might have caused kubernetes_executors left behind.\r\n\r\nwrapping start()/end() in

we separated actions into composite workflows in #27369 and the #27371 we missed the fact that there was a step passing the host python version to static checks - to make sure we start with a fresh cache every time new python version is changed (this caused problems in the past)\r\n\r\nThe \"host-python-version\" was therefore empty and not really used in the cache key determining.\r\n\r\nThis has no bad effect when Python version does not change but when there is an upgrade of Python, the symbolic links in stored cache get broken, and next time new Python version is used in the AMIs, we might get them broken, so better to fix it now.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

#28167.\r\n\r\nAllow rendering of markdown for the task and dagrun notes in the grid view.\r\n\r\nWe use a [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown) which is very well maintained and popular and the [remark-gfm](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gfm) plugin to add support for table, strikethrough, checklist and other extra tags.\r\n\r\nWe add a custom components mapping to be able to render ChakraUI components. This allows us to the markdown part consistent with the rest of the app. (same components). We also have full control here of what is rendered for each element.\r\n\r\nA few improvement to consider, that can come as follow up PRs:\r\n- As we render ChakraUI component when rendering the markdown, it is so consistent with the rest of the app that it can be difficult to dissociate what is the note, and what is the actual UI. To address this I added a few style unique to the markdown part so we have some differences (especially in font size) but it is not obvious. (maybe splitting to its own tab would help, see below)\r\n- Long notes are hard to see in the details tab because there is already a lot of information, maybe separating the note in its own tab would make it easier to visualize. (And also dissociate from the rest of the UI)\r\n- During my test, it was working pretty well, and we might sometimes want to put more that 1000 characters in the note. Maybe we could increase this a bit. (A table for instance really fills up the limit quite rapidly, just wondering)\r\n- No support yet for syntax highlighting for code block. This is just a normal 'Code' component and no language specific stuff happen. There are plugins for that, we might want to take a look.\r\n- I activated the 'skipHtml' props, as I don't know yet how safe it is to allow arbitrary html to run in here or if this is working well.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn examples:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/206583974-55341588-310e-4f3d-9157-f121eec0c00b.png)\r\n\r\nAnother one with a table and a code block:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14861206/206585072-0b130b1b-fa87-413b-9f3a-34626d2e07c8.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-08T23:15:10Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T23:30:56Z","closed_at":"2022-12-19T15:32:04Z","merged_at":"2022-12-19T15:32:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"74e82af7eefe1d0d5aa6ea1637d096e4728dea1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545584474,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTg0NDc0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:webserver","name":"area:webserver","color":"a9db3f","default":false,"description":"Webserver related Issues"},{"id":2172800850,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwODUw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:improvement","name":"type:improvement","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog: Improvements"},{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

of caching for pre-commits in CI has been broken:\r\n\r\n* full pre-commit cache had `pre-commit-` instead of `pre-commit-full-`\r\n* basic checks never run in \"main\" so the cache had not been stored in the main branch - thus pre-commits for the basic checks were never cached.

A custom function can also be written that returns a list of adaptations to filter in logs as well.\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-08T21:23:54Z","updated_at":"2023-01-09T23:37:49Z","closed_at":"2022-12-15T10:29:26Z","merged_at":"2022-12-15T10:29:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"2794662459b6d2f40b55b9b1d39eed14b5c3c5e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1769748000,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5NzQ4MDAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:logging","name":"area:logging","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

of the way that the task log handler reads from running k8s executor pods, we must keep pod name <= 63 characters.  The handler gets pod name from ti.hostname. TI hostname is derived from the container hostname, which is truncated to 63 characters. We could lift this limit by using label selectors instead of pod name to find the pod. But for now, easy enough to keep limited to 63.\r\n\r\nSince we limit to 63 in the code, we can remove the logic to find the matching pod when length is >= 63.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n\r\nRecently I made changes that allowed for longer pod name, and take up less space on the random part, and allow hyphens.  At the time it wasn't clear why the pod id length had to be limited.  But I think the reason is this task log issue.  So we restore the length limit here, while still retaining the other improvements.  And we make clear in the place where we limit what is the reason for the limit.  And we remove the code to handle longer limit since it's not needed.  For KPO, we can keep the longer name since hostname is not used for pod id. (there we use labels)\r\n","created_at":"2022-12-08T20:25:03Z","updated_at":"2023-04-11T09:41:16Z","closed_at":"2022-12-08T21:11:33Z","merged_at":"2022-12-08T21:11:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"bdc3d2e6474f7f23f75683fd072b4a07ef5aaeaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1769748000,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzY5NzQ4MDAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:logging","name":"area:logging","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

PR cleans up a bit of tech debt in the EKS operators.  When I wrote them I didn't know what boto waiters were.  A Boto waiter is similar to an Ariflow Sensor but the delay, backoff, and max-retries is all handled server-side by the service.  I've replaced a bunch of my custom waiter code with official boto waiters, added the infrastructure to allow us to write custom waiters, along with documentation and an example.\r\n\r\nThis should make future AWS sensors much easier and cleaner to write.  We may want to go through the existing sensors and convert them over at some point.  This also opens up an interesting idea of using a custom waiter in a TaskFlow method in place of a sensor.  Who knows.\r\n\r\nRendered version of the README is [here](https://github.com/aws-mwaa/upstream-to-airflow/blob/a5ff1624eae1570ad9b885fdbc8ec4c1a3b65ea7/airflow/providers/amazon/aws/waiters/README.md)

the Presto -> Trino fork, Presto seem to be on its way out. They stopped being community friendly, and even Amazon dropped the suport for Presto in favour of Trino, also Facebook does not seem to be a great shehphard for Presto - for 1.5 years after the split they were not even able to release a good, supported and upgraded Docker image that could be attributed to the project and not some random 2GB images published by random people.\r\n\r\nWe cannot run those integration tests without a proper Presto container, and we've waited long enough - after the recent integration tests separation it became clear that it makes little sense to keep those stale and unused tests in our repo.\r\n\r\nWe can always bring them back when the situation improves on the Presto side and they will become more community-friendly.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

parallelism for public runners is 2 because they have 2 CPUS. However image pulling is mostly about I/O (CPU is only really used when images are extracted and when tests are run - a bit).\r\n\r\nWith parallelism = 2 the 4 images are serializing (first 2 images are pulled and tested and then 2 remaining ones)\r\n\r\nBy setting parallelism to 6 we are allowing all 4 images to run in parallel and we are safe for 3.11 when it is out to also run in parallel). That should save ~2 minutes for image pulling.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.
