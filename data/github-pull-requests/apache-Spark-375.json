What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR aims to implement decimal aggregation optimization for window queries by improving existing `DecimalAggregates`. Historically, `DecimalAggregates` optimizer is designed to transform general `sum/avg(decimal)`, but it breaks recently added windows queries like the followings. The following queries work well without the current `DecimalAggregates` optimizer.\n\n**Sum**\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"select sum(a) over () from (select explode(array(1.0,2.0)) a)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`JavaStreamingContext.awaitTermination` methods should be declared as `@throws[InterruptedException]` so that this exception can be handled in Java code. Note this is not just a doc change, but an API change, since now (in Java) the method has a checked exception to handle. All await-like methods in Java APIs behave this way, so seems worthwhile for 2.0.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJenkins

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPart of the reason why TaskMetrics and its callers are complicated are due to the optional metrics we collect, including input, output, shuffle read, and shuffle write. I think we can always track them and just assign 0 as the initial values. It is usually very obvious whether a task is supposed to read any data or not. By always tracking them, we can remove a lot of map, foreach, flatMap, getOrElse(0L) calls throughout Spark.\n\nThis patch also changes a few behaviors.\n1. Removed the distinction of data read/write methods (e.g. Hadoop, Memory, Network, etc).\n2. Accumulate all data reads and writes, rather than only the first method. (Fixes SPARK-5225)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting tests.\n\nThis is bases on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12388, with more test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn the (rare) case where yStd is 0 in LinearRegression, parameters are not copied immediately to the created LinearRegressionModel instance, but they should (as in all other cases), because now the default column names are used in and returned by model.findSummaryModelAndPredictionCol(), which leads to schema validation errors.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nsome simple manual

found when we fit R glm model(or other models powered by R formula) w/o intercept on a dataset including string/category features, one of the categories in the first category feature is being used as reference category, we will not drop any category for that feature.\nI think we should keep consistent semantics between Spark RFormula and R formula.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd standard

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR removes \n- Inappropriate type notations\n  For example, from\n  \n  ``` scala\n  words.foreachRDD { (rdd: RDD[String], time: Time) =>\n  ...\n  ```\n  \n  to\n  \n  ``` scala\n  words.foreachRDD { (rdd, time) => \n  ...\n  ```\n- Extra anonymous closure within functional transformations.\n  For example,\n  \n  ``` scala\n  .map(item => {\n    ...\n  })\n  ```\n  \n  which can be just simply as below:\n  \n  ``` scala\n  .map { item => \n    ...\n  }\n  ```\n\nand corrects some obvious style nits.\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR returns correct processor name in `/proc/cpuinfo` on Linux from  `Benchmark.getPorcessorName()`. Now, this return `Unknown processor`.\nSince `Utils.executeAndGetOutput(Seq(\"which\", \"grep\"))` return `/bin/grep\\n`, it is failed to execute `/bin/grep\\n`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSupport partitioning in the file stream sink. This is implemented using a new, but simpler code path for writing parquet files - both unpartitioned and partitioned. This new code path does not use Output Committers, as we will eventually write the file names to the metadata log for \"committing\" them. \n\nThis patch duplicates < 100 LOC from the WriterContainer. But its far simpler that WriterContainer as it does not involve output committing. In addition, it introduces the new APIs in FileFormat and OutputWriterFactory in an attempt to simplify the APIs (not have Job in the `FileFormat` API, not have bucket and other stuff in the `OutputWriterFactory.newInstance()` ).\n# Tests\n- New unit tests to test the FileStreamSinkWriter for partitioned and unpartitioned files\n- New unit test to partially test the FileStreamSink for partitioned files (does not test recovery of partition column data, as that requires change in the StreamFileCatalog, future PR).\n- Updated FileStressSuite to test number of records read from partitioned output files.\n","created_at":"2016-04-15T03:50:29Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T18:00:19Z","closed_at":"2016-05-03T18:00:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0207e4ca3272f1e4fd5dc8ec2a7cce961171fb5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12409/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12409/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12409/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f0709faf9bfeb4bffa1bd692cae7fce4bfa407ab","head":{"label":"tdas:streaming-partitioned-parquet","ref":"streaming-partitioned-parquet","sha":"f0709faf9bfeb4bffa1bd692cae7fce4bfa407ab","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAllow users to issue \"`SHOW CREATE TABLE`\" command natively in SparkSQL. \n-- For tables that are created by Hive, this command will display the DDL in hive syntax. If the syntax includes `CLUSTERED BY, SKEWED BY or STORED BY` clause, there will be a warning message saying that this DDL is not supported in SparkSQL native DDL yet. \n\n-- For tables that are created by datasource DDL, such as \"`CREATE TABLE... USING ... OPTIONS (...)`\", it will show the DDL in this syntax. \n\n-- For tables that are created by dataframe API, such as \"`df.write.partitionBy(...).saveAsTable(...)`\", currently the command will display DDL with the syntax \"CREATE TABLE.. USING...OPTIONS(...)\". However, this syntax lose the partitioning information. It is proposed to display create table in the dataframe API format (Will make this in another PR )\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests are created.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch adds a `PersistentState` that groups state shared across multiple `SQLContext`s. This is analogous to the `SessionState` added in SPARK-13526 that groups session-specific state. This cleanup makes the constructors of the contexts simpler and ultimately allows us to remove `HiveContext` in the near future.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nJust refactoring.\n","created_at":"2016-04-15T01:05:37Z","updated_at":"2016-04-17T02:18:54Z","closed_at":"2016-04-16T21:02:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4a02d3ec8631291622923cf53d74b0bfb582748","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12405/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12405/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2a84b8c6bc5e62bd4eaee03c7623f3095c3b9698","head":{"label":"andrewor14:persistent-state","ref":"persistent-state","sha":"2a84b8c6bc5e62bd4eaee03c7623f3095c3b9698","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSee [SPARK-11834 ](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11834)for details of this issue. \nIgnore the setThresholds call in ML's LogisticRegression. It currently clears any user defined threshold, but it should be disabled until multi-class Logistic Regression is added.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI have built and run setThresholds() with the classes LogisticRegression and LogisticRegressionModel, both return the appropriate warning messages. Spark ml tests were run and passed successfully.\n\n![screen shot 2016-04-14 at 11 39 33

The test_add_py_package is not using addPyPackage and still works. The addRequirementsFile method requires internet access to hit the global pypi server and won't work on the current Jenkins build system.\n\nWe have had this patch running at Palantir for about a year

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nPart of the reason why TaskMetrics and its callers are complicated are due to the optional metrics we collect, including input, output, shuffle read, and shuffle write. I think we can always track them and just assign 0 as the initial values. It is usually very obvious whether a task is supposed to read any data or not. By always tracking them, we can remove a lot of map, foreach, flatMap, getOrElse(0L) calls throughout Spark.\n\nThis patch also changes a few behaviors.\n1. Removed the distinction of data read/write methods (e.g. Hadoop, Memory, Network, etc).\n2. Accumulate all data reads and writes, rather than only the first method. (Fixes SPARK-5225)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14627\n\nEvery time we call `TypedAggregateExpression.update` method, we call encoder's `shift` method. As shift method will copy encoder and underlying `BoundReference`, we should prepare the shifted encoder in advance, instead of calling `shift` method every time.\n\nBTW, we can also slightly improve encoder's `shift` method to return itself when shift delta is zero.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests.\n","created_at":"2016-04-14T06:56:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:33:28Z","closed_at":"2016-04-14T09:01:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f5b818fb313299aab98a610d902668d87356efd4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/faf1ddf87c454414624877fbc56f675fa03bb97f","head":{"label":"viirya:skip-copy-bencoder","ref":"skip-copy-bencoder","sha":"faf1ddf87c454414624877fbc56f675fa03bb97f","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI was trying to understand the accumulator and metrics update source code and these two classes don't really need to be case classes. It would also be more consistent with other UI classes if they are not case classes. This is part of my bigger effort to simplify accumulators and task metrics.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a straightforward refactoring without behavior

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSince we cannot really trust if the underlying external catalog can throw exceptions when there is an invalid metadata operation, let's do it in SessionCatalog.\n- [X] The first step is to unify the error messages issued in Hive-specific Session Catalog and general Session Catalog. \n- [X] The second step is to verify the inputs of metadata operations for partitioning-related operations. This is moved to a separate PR: https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12801\n- [X] The third step is to add database existence verification in `SessionCatalog`\n- [X] The fourth step is to add table existence verification in `SessionCatalog`\n- [X] The fifth step is to add function existence verification in `SessionCatalog`\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd test cases and verify the error messages we issued\n","created_at":"2016-04-14T06:31:14Z","updated_at":"2016-05-15T22:10:06Z","closed_at":"2016-05-10T18:29:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d1420e7c95c8fce82575677f1b5a0b8ac1ca6b6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12385/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12385/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12385/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2c6535e270dd629a43356347ebbbff43552ac689","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:verifySessionAPIs","ref":"verifySessionAPIs","sha":"2c6535e270dd629a43356347ebbbff43552ac689","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen there are multiple attempts for a stage, we currently only reset internal accumulator values if all the tasks are resubmitted. It would make more sense to reset the accumulator values for each stage attempt. This will allow us to eventually get rid of the internal flag in the Accumulator class. This is part of my bigger effort to simplify accumulators and task metrics.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nCovered by existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nA nonsensical split is produced from method `findSplitsForContinuousFeature` for decision trees. This PR removes the superfluous split and updates unit tests accordingly. Additionally, an assertion to check that the number of found splits is `> 0` is removed, and instead features with zero possible splits are ignored. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA unit test was added to check that finding splits for a constant feature produces an empty

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR changes BaggedPoint to store the number of subsamples AND the sample weight of `Datum`. Specifically:\n- `subsampleWeights: Array[Double]` is changed to `subsampleCounts: Array[Int]`\n- A `sampleWeight: Double` field is added to the BaggedPoint constructor\n- A function to extract the sample weight from `datum` is added to `convertToBaggedPointRDD`. This will be helpful when we add weights to decision trees, so that we can extract the instance weight from the `RDD[Instance]`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis PR does not introduce any new functional changes, so there are no tests added.\n","created_at":"2016-04-13T22:09:15Z","updated_at":"2016-10-10T19:33:41Z","closed_at":"2016-10-10T19:33:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2030352c7e90e3ab824ff4751d9caf7716e3383","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a673658c4d2f6121b7854be80ade481ae2c18ddb","head":{"label":"sethah:SPARK-14599","ref":"SPARK-14599","sha":"a673658c4d2f6121b7854be80ade481ae2c18ddb","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis adds a new configuration, `spark.shuffle.spillAfterRead`, which can be used to force `Spillable`s to spill their contents after all records have been inserted.  The default is false, to keep previous behavior and avoid a performance penalty when unnecessary.  However this needed in cases to prevent an OOM when one `Spillable` acquires all of the execution memory available for a task, thus leaving no memory available for any other operations in the same task.\n\nThis also required some small refactoring of `Spillable` to support a forced spill from an external request (as opposed to not having enough memory as records are added).\n\nI was initially hoping to limit the places where we needed to spill -- I thought that it would only be in a `ShuffleMapTask` which also does a shuffle-read. In that case there is clearly a `Spillable` on both the shuffle-read and shuffle-write side.  However, I realized this wasn't sufficient -- there are other cases when you can have multiple `Spillable`s, eg if you use a common partitioner across several aggregations, which will get pipelined into one stage.\n\nThis also makes `Spillable`s register themselves as `MemoryConsumer`s with the `TaskMemoryManager`.  Note that this does _not_ lead to cooperative memory management for `Spillable`s -- the only reason for this is to improve the logging around memory usage.  Before this change, there would be messages like:\n\n```\nINFO memory.TaskMemoryManager: 217903352 bytes of memory were used by task 2109 but are not associated with specific consumers\n```\n\ninstead, with this change the logs report the memory as being associated with the corresponing `Spillable`\n## How was this patch tested?\n- unit tests were added to reproduce the original problem\n- jenkins unit tests\n- also independently ran some large workloads which were consistently getting an OOM before this change, which now pass\n","created_at":"2016-04-13T21:18:31Z","updated_at":"2016-04-22T16:17:56Z","closed_at":"2016-04-22T16:17:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c4d44c07a599b1a4ae8077986671db19013eff29","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12369/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12369/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12369/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a3c1c12b5f9bc60baae7258956821f757754db75","head":{"label":"squito:config_SPARK-14560","ref":"config_SPARK-14560","sha":"a3c1c12b5f9bc60baae7258956821f757754db75","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe problem is: In `RowEncoder`, we use `Invoke` to get the field of an external row, which lose the nullability information. This PR creates a `GetExternalRowField` expression, so that we can preserve the nullability info.\n\nTODO: simplify the null handling logic in `RowEncoder`, to remove so many if branches, in follow-up PR.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in `RowEncoderSuite`\n\nNote that, This PR takes over https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11980, with a little simplification, so all credits should go to @koertkuipers

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThese changes fix the below broken functionality and does a small performance improvement. \n\n1) Reading the CSV table (created through CTAS query) doesn't work when the pathFilter is provided.\nA bug in HadoopFileReader. Currently, when the pathFilter is provided, it passes the list of filtered files to the \"setInputPaths\" which wrongly sets the string of incorrectly escaped comma separated files in an array-sequence of size one. This should have been a sequence of size equal to the number of files obtained after filtering. Hence the exception mentioned in the bug. \n------ FileInputFormat.setInputPaths(jobConf, Seq[Path](new Path%28path%29): _*)\n\n2) Secondly, in this flow,  filtering is triggered twice for each file. Once in hadoopTableReader.applyFilterIfApplicable and then again in FileInputFormat.singleThreadedListStatus.  This is costly and redundant. \n\nTo solve both the issues above, we can just pass the directory path itself even when the pathFilter is enabled.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nIntegration tests, manual tests\n","created_at":"2016-04-13T10:55:43Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:02Z","closed_at":"2017-06-27T12:17:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0f617fe944395979899de7ee64658fb78df7d225","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12356/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12356/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12356/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ba453b790b5bfa0e34ee54193e374d14bd3ee33","head":{"label":"kasjain:master","ref":"master","sha":"5ba453b790b5bfa0e34ee54193e374d14bd3ee33","user":{"login":"kasjain","id":7554674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTQ2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7554674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain","html_url":"https://github.com/kasjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":30340656,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDM0MDY1Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"kasjain/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kasjain","id":7554674,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc1NTQ2NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7554674?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain","html_url":"https://github.com/kasjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kasjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kasjain/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nToday we have `DDLSuite`, `DDLCommandSuite`, `HiveDDLCommandSuite` and `HiveDDLSuite`. In this PR, I am trying to consolidate the files as much as possible. Two files are left for now, since it is good to put Hive related test suite in the Hive package. \n\nAlong with the combination, I also did some modification of current codes mainly in order to improve the codings, here is the summary:\n1. Use `.contains(...)` instead `== Some(...)` for Options, this method is introduced in Scala 2.11 and it is recommended method to use for this purpose;\n2. Make map consistent to use `->`, instead of 2 elements tuple;\n3. Use `isEmpty()` instead of `== None`\n4. Add `private` to the parser and narrow the scope of implicit (put inside one of the tests); \n5. Modify the names of some tests to be unique, since they are in one file now;\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI did not change the logic of any tests, just move around and improve the codes, so existing test cases should remain same.\n","created_at":"2016-04-13T02:32:42Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T22:12:41Z","closed_at":"2016-04-25T20:54:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c8b86ef6e7d99d5dc37f6de7db88483b4026ea85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12347/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12347/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12347/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06c8948b20cacccead019e42e3a07b89f727893a","head":{"label":"bomeng:SPARK-14441","ref":"SPARK-14441","sha":"06c8948b20cacccead019e42e3a07b89f727893a","user":{"login":"bomeng","id":295781,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI5NTc4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/295781?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng","html_url":"https://github.com/bomeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bomeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"587cd554af24601d332e9ce5c74e98b62d0fd830","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch speeds up group-by aggregates by around 3-5x by leveraging an in-memory `AggregateHashMap` (please see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12161), an append-only aggregate hash map that can act as a 'cache' for extremely fast key-value lookups while evaluating aggregates (and fall back to the `BytesToBytesMap` if a given key isn't found).\n\nArchitecturally, it is backed by a power-of-2-sized array for index lookups and a columnar batch that stores the key-value pairs. The index lookups in the array rely on linear probing (with a small number of maximum tries) and use an inexpensive hash function which makes it really efficient for a majority of lookups. However, using linear probing and an inexpensive hash function also makes it less robust as compared to the `BytesToBytesMap` (especially for a large number of keys or even for certain distribution of keys) and requires us to fall back on the latter for correctness.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n```\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_73-b02 on Mac OS X 10.11.4\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-4960HQ

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR try to increase the parallelism for small table (a few of big files) to reduce the query time, by decrease the maxSplitBytes, the goal is to have at least one task per CPU in the cluster, if the total size of all files is bigger than openCostInBytes \\* 2 \\* nCPU. \n\nFor example, a small/medium table could be used as dimension table in huge query, this will be useful to reduce the time waiting for broadcast.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

This PR puts these two actions into `synchronized` to make sure they are atomic.\n\nIn addition, this PR also has the following changes:\n- Make `committedOffsets` and `availableOffsets` volatile to

has a few modules which do not depend on Scala, including `launcher`, `unsafe`, `sketch`, and the `network-*` libraries. However, we currently cross build and publish these artifacts for different Scala versions.\n\nThis patch refactors Spark's build so that pure-Java modules can be published once and so that their artifact ids do not include `_2.xx` suffixes. A consequence of this change is that pure Java modules' build output directories will be `/target/classes` rather than `/target/scala-*/classes`. For uniformity, I updated _all_ projects, including Scala ones, to use this output directory convention. I think that the only reason to prefer SBT's `crossPaths` convention is if you're using SBT's cross-build support (which, AFAIK, doesn't currently work for Spark and isn't something that we're aiming to support).\n\nThe `target` directory changes, in turn, allowed me to significantly simplify the launcher code and removed the need to detect and set `SPARK_SCALA_VERSION` in the launcher scripts. This simplification will have a huge payoff when if we eventually have to simultaneously support Scala 2.10.x, 2.11.x, and 2.12.x, since there's now much less version detection logic to maintain.\n\n/cc @rxin @marmbrus @ahirreddy @srowen

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUse a random table name instead of `__THIS__` in SQLTransformer, and add a test for `transformSchema`. The problems of using `__THIS__` are:\n- It doesn't work under HiveContext (in Spark 1.6)\n- Race conditions\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Manual test with HiveContext.\n- Added a unit test for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen we clean a closure, if its outermost parent is not a closure, we won't clone and clean it as cloning user's objects is dangerous. However, if it's a REPL line object, which may carry a lot of unnecessary references(like hadoop conf, spark conf, etc.), we should clean it as it's not a user object.\n\nThis PR improves the check for user's objects to exclude REPL line object.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nexisting
