The conversion from entrySet of Map to List causes the random order of List's element. This randomness further causes the non-deterministic behavior of `put` method in gora-ignite/src/main/java/org/apache/gora/ignite/store/IgniteStore, which calls these two methods. All tests calling `put` method of class `IgniteStore` are thus flaky.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in gora-ignite/src/main/java/org/apache/gora/ignite/store/IgnoreStoreMetadataAnalyzer, method `getTableNames` iterates an unsorted ResultSet object `executeQuery` and appends its elements into List of table name Strings. The order of the table names in the list is random, but the list is then returned and compared with a list with fixed order in line 42 of gora-ignite/src/test/java/org/apache/gora/ignite/store/TestIgniteStore\r\n\r\n```java\r\nAssert.assertTrue(\"Ignite Store Metadata Table Names\", createAnalyzer.getTablesNames().equals(Lists.newArrayList(\"WEBPAGE\", \"EMPLOYEE\")));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe randomness of the list returned by `getTableNames` thus may cause unexpected failure of TestIgniteStore.\r\n\r\n### Steps to Reproduce\r\n\r\nI used tool NonDex to detect the flaky tests.\r\n\r\nNonDex: https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex\r\n\r\nRun the tests with NonDex: \r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn -pl gora-ignite edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.gora.ignite.store.TestIgniteStore\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message shows:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n

Solution\r\n\r\nTo fix the non-deterministic behavior of method `createInsertQuery` and `fillInsertQuery` of class `IgniteSQLBuilder`, we can pass a fix-ordered List instead of a random-ordered Map as parameters into these two functions:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static String createInsertQuery(IgniteMapping mapping, List<Column> dataKeyList)\r\npublic static void fillInsertQuery(PreparedStatement statement, List<Object> insertData)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in `put` method of class `IgniteStore`, we maintain two lists storing Map object `data`'s keys and values:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nList<Column> dataKeyList = new ArrayList<>();\r\nList<Object> dataValueList = new ArrayList<>();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever we put a key-value pair into Map object `data`, we update these two lists by adding the key and value. Therefore, the order of elements in these two lists will be deterministic, exactly matching the order in which we put key-value pairs into Map object `data`. We can then pass these two lists into method `createInsertQuery` and `fillInsertQuery` and fix the non-deterministic behavior.\r\n\r\nTo fix the non-deterministic behavior of method `getTableNames` in class IgnoreStoreMetadataAnalyzer, we can sort the List `tab` before returning it:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nCollections.sort(tabs);\r\n```\r\n\r\n Then, the order of elements in List `tab` will be deterministic, following alphabetical order.\r\n\r\nCorrespondingly, we need to change the list for comparison in line 42 of `TestIgniteStore` to alphabetical order:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nAssert.assertTrue(\"Ignite Store Metadata Table Names\", createAnalyzer.getTablesNames().equals(Lists.newArrayList(\"EMPLOYEE\",

Description\r\nTest `org.apache.gora.mongodb.filters.DefaultFactoryTest#testCreateFilter_list_2` occasionally fails when the order of fields in  the `JSONObject` objects is different. The root cause is that current test compares the two `JSONObject` objects by converting them to strings, which is order-sensitive, and could fail when field order differs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nI used [Nondex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) to introduce randomness by run `mvn -pl gora-mongodb edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.7:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.gora.mongodb.filters.DefaultFactoryTest#testCreateFilter_list_2\r\n`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Behaviour\r\nThis test should pass consistently, regardless of the order of fields in the `JSONObject`, as long as the content remains the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behaviour\r\nThe test occasionally fails, raise an exception with error message:\r\n> DefaultFactoryTest.testCreateFilter_list_2:119 expected:<{\"[h.C·T\":\"text/html\",\"url\":\"http://www.example.com]\"}> but was:<{\"[url\":\"http://www.example.com\",\"h.C·T\":\"text/html]\"}>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed Solution\r\nThe solution is to parse both expected and actual `JSONObject` into `JsonNode`, rather than comparing them as strings. Then use Jackson's `ObjectMapper` to compare the two `JsonNode` objects, which ignores the order of the

is my proposal for a [Jenkinsfile](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile/) for Apache Gora.\r\n\r\n### Add Jenkinsfile\r\n\r\nThere is two stages in this pipeline:\r\n\r\n- **Build** which trigger `mvn clean install` targets\r\n\r\n- **Test** which trigger `mvn verify` and transform any failure as UNSTABLE status for Jenkins job\r\n\r\n### Improve tests stability\r\n\r\nI've also improved _Aerospike_ and _RethinkDB_ tests.\r\nI'm using [container's ip address returned by _testcontainer_](https://www.testcontainers.org/features/networking/#getting-the-container-host) instead of `localhost` to support use case where Jenkins is running inside Docker (aka Docker in Docker)\r\n\r\nCloses :

are a couple of issues I faced with:\r\n1) Is it ok to remove `allowRemoteDCsForLocalConsistencyLevel` completely like I did? The docs say \"DC failover shouldn't be done in the driver, which does not have the necessary context to know what makes sense considering application semantics\", so it probably does not make sense to keep this as an option in gora.\r\n2) Datastax developers [decided to remove](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/3.5/upgrade_guide/#3-5-0) `DowngradingConsistencyRetryPolicy` adding that users will now have to implement this logic themselves. It is probably possible to implement something analogous to their [example](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/blob/3.x/driver-examples/src/main/java/com/datastax/driver/examples/retry/DowngradingRetry.java), but I think that  its impementation is out of this

However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin \n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit
