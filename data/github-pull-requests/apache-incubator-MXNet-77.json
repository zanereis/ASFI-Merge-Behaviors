@gautamkmr @sandeep-krishnamurthy \r\n\r\nThis is Part 1 of a series of changes to the **current MXNet PR build Process**. \r\n\r\n**This change might lead to some issues on Apache Jenkins, specially with requiring some script approvals as indicated[ here](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Script+Security+Plugin)**\r\n\r\nThe code for this method has been picked as is from [this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40760716/jenkins-abort-running-build-if-new-one-is-started) \r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior** - \r\n1. I have a added a new stage to our builds called 'Purge' (other name suggestions are welcome)\r\n2. This stage runs on a 'mxnetlinux' slave at the moment. This means it joins the queue waiting for an idle slave before it can kill an existing PR build. If we want to avoid this, it can be changed to be scheduled to the master. \r\n3. The method called 'abortPreviousRunningBuilds' simply scans all build numbers for the current PR and checks their status. If it is not the current build but is still running, the status of the build is changed to Aborted. \r\n\r\n**Testing Done** - \r\nI have reproduced a multibranch pipeline job on our internal jenkins similar to apache. Tests have only been done on a feature branch and PRs. The master branch should work similarly. I have tested that -\r\n1. When a new branch is created, the build goes through fine. \r\n2. If a new build is triggered on a branch (say using 'Build Now'), the purge stage works as expected. (This behavior might need to be changed specially for the master branch)\r\n3. When a new PR is created, the build works fine\r\n4. Any updates to the PR terminates the old build and a new one is created. \r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-09-25 at 3 53 11

a shape issue with the Perplexity metric after #7949  and #8003 were merged: after these PRs, the executor group slices graph outputs according to the size of the batch axis. This forces graph/symbol outputs to be batch-major if used to compute metrics.\r\nIn cases like Sockeye, we used to feed label as `(batch_size, length)` into the graph, but return `(batch_size*length, vocab_size)` as output after SoftmaxOutput. This is also the required format for the Perplexity metric.\r\nWith the PRs mentioned above, this now fails, as the executor_group slices the `(batch_size*length, vocab_size)` output to `(batch_size, vocab_size)`, which is obviously wrong.\r\n\r\nWe can fix this by using `preserve_shape=True` in our SoftmaxOutput call and return `(batch_size, length, vocab_size)` outputs.\r\nHowever, this caused the Perplexity metric to fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by doing an optional reshape of the predictions to

solves the following problem in MXNet v.0.11.x (not present in v.0.10.0):\r\n\r\nIf a user creates a CustomOperator in Python that requires no arguments, but has at least one output, the [create_operator_entry](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/operator.py#L754) callback from C++ receives a wrong `num_input` argument and then fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  File \"/Users/fhieber/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/operator.py\", line 763, in create_operator_entry\r\n    dtypes = [dtypes[i] for i in range(num_inputs)]\r\n  File \"/Users/fhieber/miniconda3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/mxnet/operator.py\", line 763, in <listcomp>\r\n    dtypes = [dtypes[i] for i in range(num_inputs)]\r\nValueError: NULL pointer access\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to the C++ backend which initializes the `shapes` vector with a total size of in_args + out_args + aux_args in [CreateState](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/custom/custom.cc#L228). `shapes` will always be of at least size 1 (e.g for operators with 0 arguments and 1 output). The code then proceeds to write only to the `shapes` vector based on the `in_shape` argument, and does not write to index 1.\r\n\r\nBack in the `create_operator_entry` Python function a wrong num_input causes a null pointer access in line 763.\r\n\r\nThe following example code reproduces the problem with the current master:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nprint(mx.__version__)\r\nclass MyCustomOp(mx.operator.CustomOp):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, size: int) -> None:\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.data = mx.nd.ones((size,))\r\n\r\n    def forward(self, is_train, req, in_data, out_data, aux):\r\n        self.assign(out_data[0], req[0], self.data)\r\n\r\n    def backward(self, req, out_grad, in_data, out_data, in_grad, aux):\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n@mx.operator.register(\"my_custom_op\")\r\nclass AutoRegressiveBiasProp(mx.operator.CustomOpProp):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, size: str) -> None:\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.size = int(size)\r\n\r\n    def list_arguments(self):\r\n        return []\r\n\r\n    def list_auxiliary_states(self):\r\n        return []\r\n\r\n    def list_outputs(self):\r\n        return ['output']\r\n\r\n    def infer_shape(self, in_shape):\r\n        return [], [(self.size,)], []\r\n\r\n    def infer_type(self, in_type):\r\n        return [], [np.float32], []\r\n\r\n    def create_operator(self, ctx, shapes, dtypes):\r\n        return MyCustomOp(size=self.size)\r\n\r\n\r\nop = mx.sym.Custom(size=4, name='my_custom', op_type='my_custom_op')\r\nprint(op.tojson())\r\nprint(op.list_inputs())\r\nprint(op.infer_shape())\r\nop.simple_bind(ctx=mx.cpu())\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut runs fine with this PR.\r\n\r\nWe have a need for such operators in our Sockeye project and would like to update to MXNet v.0.11.0. Hence it would be great one of the core maintainers ( @piiswrong ) could take a look at this and confirm that this change does not break anything else, or if there is a better way of handling custom operators without input arguments. It would also be great to backport this to the v.0.11.0 release for us to update to the stable

 Background:\r\nThe current rule for graph executor to dispatch on `FCompute` & `FComputeEx` is naive: if any input/output contains non-default storage, `FComputeEx` will be preferred; otherwise, choose `FCompute`. \r\n\r\n#### Why it's bad:\r\n- Such dispatch rule may lead to the case where `FComputeEx` is registered and chosen to dispatch, but it's not capable of handle specific storage types, and need to fallback inside `FComputeEx`. Ideally, we want `FComputeEx` functions to be \"fallback-free\". \r\n- Since fallback requires temp resource on gpu, when fallback happens inside `FComputeEx`, the resource needs to be requested on the fly. This leads to unclear responsibility since all resource requests are expected to be handled in attach_exec_resource_pass. \r\n\r\n#### The new interface to fix it:\r\nWe should incorporate dispatch logic inside infer_storage_type pass with the new interface below:\r\n```cpp\r\nenum FcompDispatchMode {\r\n  kDispatchFCompute;\r\n  kDispatchFComputeEx;\r\n  kDispatchFComputeFallback;\r\n  ... \r\n}\r\n\r\ninline bool InferStorageType(const nnvm::NodeAttrs& attrs,\r\n    const int dev_mask,    // useful for MKL related storage inference\r\n    int *dispatch_mode,   // useful to determine if fallback is required\r\n    std::vector<int> *in_attrs,\r\n    std::vector<int> *out_attrs,\r\n) {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring infer_storage_type pass, we will decide whether to dispatch for FComputeEx or FCompute based on attrs. When dispatch type is kFComputeFallback, extra resources are requested. \r\n\r\n#### Changes Summary\r\n- Updated infer_attr pass function for graph_executor, which now is able to infer attribute for node entries ((storage_type) and for the node itself (dispatch_mode). \r\n- The stype of gradients are [provided as inputs](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/7947/files#diff-d8b5a5b027d00584737fb6486cba38b9R585) to InferStorage during Executor::Bind. \r\n- Added default [infer storage type](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/7947/files#diff-4ccbea6a44e3cc4c99195a1e7c55c09eR321 ) function. If an operator doesn't have FInferStorageType attr set, this infer storage type function will be called. \r\n- Added warning messages when storage fallback is detected during inferstorage. It can be turned off via environment variable.\r\n-  Updated the infer storage function for all sparse operators and custom operators. \r\n-  Removed all FComputeFallback call inside FComputeEx\r\n-  Removed ad-hot storage resource requests in `cast_storage` \r\n-  Removed a kernel for SGD with dense grad and row_sparse weight.\r\n-  Disabled elemwise_binary_op for CSR inputs since we don't have any unit test for them. We should turn it back on after the test is in place. The operator should set `FResourceRequest` to get temp storage instead of doing that inside the operator \r\n- Added registration for many unary operators on gpu. They're already covered in `test_sparse_operator` when default_ctx is gpu. \r\n- Removed some unused functions in

fixes a bug I encountered with the python grad tester `numeric_grad` whilst writing tests for `SequenceLast` op. In this, `eps` is added and subtracted from all input arrays. For sequence layers, which have the lengths of the sequences, this causes problems: `1 - 0.0005 = 0.9995`, and `static_cast<int>(0.9995)` is `0`, which causes seg faults. \r\n\r\nI simply changed `static_cast` to `std::round` in `IndexTensorToVector`, which is much more robust to small numerical differences, and which allows my tests to pass (will add in another PR with these new tests once this is merged). It might still be good to fix `numeric_grad` so that it has an option to ignore arrays for which no grad can be calculated.","created_at":"2017-09-16T22:36:08Z","updated_at":"2017-09-17T18:18:46Z","closed_at":"2017-09-17T18:18:46Z","merged_at":"2017-09-17T18:18:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"19af91bec5287c3d6057389c071332f5a6b6360d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mli","id":421857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMTg1Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/421857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli","html_url":"https://github.com/mli","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mli/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7919/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/7919/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/7919/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/de23a3869e71eafaae30a20aed2f4980fa1e94b5","head":{"label":"sbodenstein:bugfix/IndexTensorToVector","ref":"bugfix/IndexTensorToVector","sha":"de23a3869e71eafaae30a20aed2f4980fa1e94b5","user":{"login":"sbodenstein","id":10237782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjM3Nzgy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10237782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein","html_url":"https://github.com/sbodenstein","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sbodenstein/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"e81a3a88abaa2c4847602dfb2864e05adc5a5f56","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/

PR resolves the issues reported by @szha as the following:\r\n\r\n1. Imperative random operators such as `mx.nd.random.uniform()` results in segmentation fault when used without user input shapes. That's because the shape attribute defaults to an empty shape if it's not provided by users. But in Numpy, such statement `np.random.uniform()` can run through and prints a single value. In order to keep consistent with Numpy's behavior, we need to default `shape=(1,)` if it is not provided by users for random operators through either `shape` or `out` attribute imperatively. For symbolic random operators, default shape is still an empty one since it might need to be inferred from other symbolic variables.\r\n\r\n2. For the imperative operators with `ctx` as one of its attributes, it should default to the `context.current_context` instead of `mx.cpu(0)` if users did not specify through either `ctx` or `out` attribute, so that the following use case can be supported:\r\n```python\r\nwith mx.Context(mx.gpu(0)):\r\n    output = mx.nd.random.uniform()\r\n    assert output.context == mx.current_context()  # current ctx is gpu(0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n@piiswrong @szha @eric-haibin-lin
