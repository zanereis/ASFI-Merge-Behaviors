adds support for torch upsample op. It enables running image segmentation models from torchvision (see the test case).\r\n\r\nI also added a simple mechanism to register a custom op conversion map, that can be used with the predefined `_convert_map` we already have. The motivation is that torch has too many ops to cover, and it also allows defining custom operators. This makes implementing all op conversion in a single map inside Relay frontend infeasible, and it would be very tedious if we have to modify TVM source each time we need to add a new conversion. Also in torch there are many esoteric operators that doesn't justify for being added to the \"official\" conversion map in the frontend.\r\n\r\nFor example of how to use the custom conversion map, see the test case `test_custom_conversion_map()` where I show how to convert torchvision's custom op `torchvision::roi_align` using Relay's `vision.roi_align` op. \r\n\r\nPlease review @jwfromm @alexwong

is a follow up to #4497. The main motivation is to make it easier to add support for control flow and quantized ops later. This PR itself doesn't contain any new functionality.  The diff for the upcoming control flow PR, building on top of the refactoring made in this PR, is [here](https://github.com/masahi/tvm/commit/d3165894f40b490e1d7d1b6f2ff9bfc60f1265a1).\r\n\r\n* Remove the class boilerplate. There is no need for using a big class with many states in the frontend really. Instead, I made everything just a function. This departs from other frontends, but I think it is better suited for parsing Torch IR in particular. In my upcoming control flow PR, I need to use recursion to parse conditionals and loops, and it is naturally expressed in a functional style.\r\n\r\n* Simplify the parsing \"main loop\" by removing as much unnecessary intermediate variables as possible. Inputs to each relay op, constants and input types are retrieved on the fly. We now keep updating only two variables, the outputs of intermediate relay ops and indices into that outputs.\r\n\r\n* Simplify the `prim::GetAttr` parsing logic in `parse_params(...)`. The current implementation is difficult to understand and if you only look at the code it is not clear what it does. `prim::GetAttr` is inherently recursive, so I use some recursion stuff to handle it. I think it is much clearer this way. As a bonus, `get_use_chains(...)` function I added can be used for other purpose as well.\r\n\r\nPlease review @zhiics @icemelon9 @alexwong @jwfromm. \r\nAside from `prim::GetAttr`mechanics, it doesn't require a detailed understanding of Torch IR.","created_at":"2020-02-26T05:18:52Z","updated_at":"2020-02-28T02:59:16Z","closed_at":"2020-02-28T02:59:16Z","merged_at":"2020-02-28T02:59:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ccb4363eefa76ae355ee263aa5527d43fb699fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

change makes the order of the params to `MergeComposite`'s generated function alphabetical. This is to make for consistent param ordering across multiple patterns which have the same logic, but param ordering may come out different.\r\n\r\nAs an example of why this is necessary: currently, `MergeComposite` gets free vars using `FreeVisitor().visit()`. This means that the ordering of the free vars is dependent on the order that the visitor visits each node. I have written two different transformer patterns, and their composite functions have come out with arguments in different orders.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(float* input, int* input_mask, float* attn_query_weight, float* attn_query_bias...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```\r\n(float* attn_query_weight, float* input, float* attn_query_bias, int* input_mask...)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have the ordering be consistent so I only have to write one backend kernel.\r\n\r\ncc @comaniac @zhiics @mbaret

always sets inner IterVar's extent to the split factor, even if the parent extent is less than the factor (usually happens when the parent has been reduced to a single point).  Although predicates are added to guard bounds, unnecessary likely statements are inserted. They are road blocks for tensorization/intrinsic.\r\n\r\nHere is an example from the new test:\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n// attr [EF] storage_scope = \"global\"\r\nallocate EF[float32 * 8]\r\nproduce E {\r\n  produce EF {\r\n    for (i, 0, 8) {\r\n      EF[i] = (I[i]*2f)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  for (i.inner, 0, 32) {\r\n    if (likely((i.inner < 8))) {\r\n      if (likely((i.inner < 8))) {\r\n        EF[i.inner] = (EF[i.inner]*2f)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n// attr [EF] storage_scope = \"global\"\r\nallocate EF[float32 * 8]\r\nproduce E {\r\n  produce EF {\r\n    for (i, 0, 8) {\r\n      EF[i] = (I[i]*2f)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  for (i.inner, 0, 8) {\r\n    EF[i.inner] = (EF[i.inner]*2f)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nTighten iv's extent to min(parent_extent, factor_or_nparts), only if all of the\r\nfollowing three conditions are met:\r\n1. No leaf IterVar is derived from iv binds to any thread.  People may use split\r\nto force an IterVar extent to match the number of allocated threads to fuse stages\r\nthat require different number of threads.  We don't want to change these extents.\r\n2. allow_missing is false, i.e. that PassDownDomain is called by the final InferBound,\r\nrather than by an early compiler phase, such as rfactor().  We don't want to tighten an\r\nIterVar in an early phase allowing missing IterVars, because it may bind to a thread later.\r\n3. range_parent's extent is not 0.  At lest one Topi test has a case where a tensor has one\r\nzero-sized dimension.  Split creates iv with a positive extent to avoid zero-extent\r\nIterVar.  We don't touch it.\r\n\r\nAn earlier attempt to this issue is in this PR (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4885).    This PR also reports it (https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4932).\r\n\r\nFollow-up to the discussion in https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4885:\r\n1. Comparing with https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4885, this one doesn't have to change existing tests/schedules and keeps allowing the following use case:\r\n```\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < 31; ++i) {\r\n   B[i] = C[i] + 1\r\n}\r\nfor (int j = 0; j < 32; ++j) {\r\n   C[i] = A[i] * 2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. The running time for tests/python/unittest/test_schedule_tensor_core.py:test_tensor_core_batch_conv reduces further (Original: 0.060 ms, https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4885: 0.035 ms, this one: 0.026ms).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-02-24T17:24:21Z","updated_at":"2020-03-11T15:57:54Z","closed_at":"2020-03-04T18:52:03Z","merged_at":"2020-03-04T18:52:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"585f9ce6e7bef7d0e8902b1c1e55dcb3bbe84eed","assignee":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4931/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4931/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4931/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/40ecacc296fa9ee4b8e79df4fbceda83fe030536","head":{"label":"yongfeng-nv:split-node-min-range-only-at-final-pass","ref":"split-node-min-range-only-at-final-pass","sha":"40ecacc296fa9ee4b8e79df4fbceda83fe030536","user":{"login":"yongfeng-nv","id":49211903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjExOTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49211903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv","html_url":"https://github.com/yongfeng-nv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":223014936,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjMwMTQ5MzY=","name":"incubator-tvm","full_name":"yongfeng-nv/incubator-tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yongfeng-nv","id":49211903,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjExOTAz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49211903?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv","html_url":"https://github.com/yongfeng-nv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yongfeng-nv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/

PR adds inlining pass to Relay.

These functions can then be inlined and offloaded to external codegen tools as discussed in #4864 \r\n\r\nThis transformation is also important to the Relay VM as inlining may reduce the calling overhead.

on my post [here](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/rfc-external-codegen-defining-composite-relay-operators/5470/9), if a pattern contains a constant, that constant should not be a parameter to the function that `MergeComposite` generates. This is because it is assumed that the constant is dealt with internally by the external codegen.\r\n\r\nA summary of the fix is: create a new `const_list` which is passed around to `ExtractPattern` calls. When creating the final function, we call `GetFreeVarsWithoutConst` instead of `FreeVars`, as `FreeVars` also returns constants. `GetFreeVarsWithoutConst` will only return free vars that aren't also in `const_list`.\r\n\r\n@comaniac @mbaret @zhiics would you be able to take a

the Keras importer can only output models with NCHW layout. This PR adds a layout argument to the Keras importer that allows NHWC to be used instead. This is useful for platforms that may have better NHWC than NCHW performance such as the Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n* Xception is not being tested in NHWC mode as I found that it was causing a strange cuda error when targeting GPU. On CPU, it works fine however so I suspect this is an issue with the nhwc separable convolutions in Topi rather than the importer.\r\n* I made a few changes to the test script to allow eager execution (and TF2.0) to work.","created_at":"2020-02-17T07:26:05Z","updated_at":"2020-02-18T19:44:55Z","closed_at":"2020-02-18T18:24:22Z","merged_at":"2020-02-18T18:24:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d646543098580490b85f5865d10d087f75ea22e","assignee":{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"masahi","id":1776403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1776403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi","html_url":"https://github.com/masahi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/masahi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4899/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/4899/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/4899/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e3ebd9d32ef7f935b4ece727421546bef1e78794","head":{"label":"jwfromm:keras_nhwc","ref":"keras_nhwc","sha":"e3ebd9d32ef7f935b4ece727421546bef1e78794","user":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":185874049,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODU4NzQwNDk=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jwfromm/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jwfromm","id":9874242,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk4NzQyNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9874242?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm","html_url":"https://github.com/jwfromm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jwfromm/follo

The first bug is that the `<<` and `>>` operators are essentially no-ops when applied to floats which can be misleading. For example:\r\n```\r\nshape = (1,1)\r\nc = tvm.compute(shape,lambda i,j: tvm.const(10) << 2.0)\r\ns = tvm.create_schedule([c.op])\r\nf = tvm.build(s,[c])\r\nc_tvm= tvm.nd.array(numpy.zeros(shape,dtype='float32'))\r\nf(c_tvm)\r\nprint(c_tvm) #Prints [[10.]] not expected [[40.]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other bitwise operators `|`, `&`, `^`, and `~` throw an error in the LLVM backend when applied to floats. For reference I tested using LLVM-8.\r\n\r\nThis bug is fixed by adding checks to filter out floats for the `|`, `&`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, and `>>` operators.\r\n\r\n# TypeError Crashes\r\n\r\nI also encountered a few more cases where operators failed to promote python types to tvm ExprOps which causes a python TypeError.\r\n\r\n```\r\na = tvm.var()\r\n10 % a #crashes\r\n10 << a #crashes\r\n10 >> a #crashes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bug is fixed by adding the missing operators to `expr.py`\r\n\r\nThis pull request also includes a regression test for both in `test_lang_basic.py`\r\n\r\n@tqchen

is a fix to the issue reported in \r\nhttps://discuss.tvm.ai/t/a-relay-vm-question-while-loop-and-free-vars/5541/\r\n\r\nIt seems if a recursive function contains free variables, the lambda lift pass (or others) generates nested call nodes, which is not handled by the VM compiler currently. See the test case for a concrete example (`body_with_free_var` triggers the bug).\r\n\r\nActually, the test case added in #4432 by @icemelon9 also triggers the same bug if I create the vm executor on

the error message I get from the parser import failure is confusing.\r\n\r\nIf I try to use VM functionality, I get an error `Couldn't find ANTLR parser. Try building with USE_ANTLR=ON.` But even if I rebuild TVM with USE_ANTLR=ON, I still get the same error because the generated parser try to import the antlr4 python package that I haven't installed, but the error still says `Try building with USE_ANTLR=ON`. \r\n\r\nThis is confusing, I think \r\n```Python\r\ntry:\r\n    from antlr4 import InputStream, CommonTokenStream\r\n    from antlr4.error.ErrorListener import ErrorListener\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    raise Exception(\"Couldn't find ANTLR runtime.\" +\r\n                    \"Try running `pip{version} install antlr4-python{version}-runtime`.\"\r\n                    .format(version=PYTHON_VERSION))\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould come before\r\n\r\n```Python\r\ntry:\r\n    from .grammar.py3.RelayVisitor import RelayVisitor\r\n    from .grammar.py3.RelayParser import RelayParser\r\n    from .grammar.py3.RelayLexer import RelayLexer\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    raise Exception(\"Couldn't find ANTLR parser.

PassDownDomain always sets inner IterVar's extent to the split factor, even when the parent extent is less than the factor (usually happens the parent has been reduced to a single point).  Although predicates are added to guard bounds, unnecessary likely statements are inserted.  They are road blocks for tensorization/intrinsic.\r\nThe fix is simple -- set the inner IterVar's ext w/ min(r->factor, parent->range).  Here is an example from the new test:\r\nBefore:\r\n```\r\n// attr [EF] storage_scope = \"global\"\r\nallocate EF[float32 * 8]\r\nproduce E {\r\n  produce EF {\r\n    for (i, 0, 8) {\r\n      EF[i] = (I[i]*2f)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  for (i.inner, 0, 32) {\r\n    if (likely((i.inner < 8))) {\r\n      if (likely((i.inner < 8))) {\r\n        EF[i.inner] = (EF[i.inner]*2f)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\n// attr [EF] storage_scope = \"global\"\r\nallocate EF[float32 * 8]\r\nproduce E {\r\n  produce EF {\r\n    for (i, 0, 8) {\r\n      EF[i] = (I[i]*2f)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  for (i.inner, 0, 8) {\r\n    EF[i.inner] = (EF[i.inner]*2f)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also have to update an existing test.  I have confirmed that the test generates expected and even cleaner code (many if statements are gone) with the

observe a great amount of tensorflow NLP models used in our production environment, and a lot of them use Hashtable related operators for word/character hashing, convert DT_STRING to integer type, and do further embedding/feature extraction in a later stage.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements 4 hashtable related tensorflow operators in tvm:\r\n- HashTableV2\r\n- InitializeTableFromTextFileV2       \r\n- LookupTableImportV2\r\n- LookupTableFindV2\r\n\r\nImplementation uses the recommended way of adding external operations. The hashtable related operations are first built as an external library, which is invoked by the TOPI layer to form operators. The tensorflow frontend parses hashtable related operators from tensorflow graph as registered relay operators. \r\n\r\nOne special thing about hashtable is that it requires an extra initialization phase of graph runtime, that populates hashtable with constant params or from an external file. Just like what tensorflow does in `tf.table_initializer()`, we need to do initialization before execution. And that involves minor change on graph runtime as well.\r\n \r\nFinally, as hashtable is mostly used for string->numeric value lookup, so we tentatively add support for string as custom datatype. As the two features are tightly coupled, so this pr contains code for both features. Test case is provided as well to help verify the functionality of hashtable implementation. \r\n \r\nAny suggestions are welcome! @tqchen

PR includes the following changes in order to let grid search and random tuner accept an index range. This is beneficial for distributed tuning since we can easily separate a tuning space to chunks and distribute them to different machines.\r\n\r\n**Note**: This change will not affect any existing use cases of grid search tuner and random tuner.\r\n\r\n- Support `range_idx` optional argument when constructing `GridSearchTuner` and `RandomTuner` to let them only tune a part of the tuning space.\r\n\r\n- Refactor `GridSearchTuner` and `RandomTuner` to have a common base class called `IndexBaseTuner`. `IndexBaseTuner`  processes `range_idx` and unifies common fields such as `counter`.\r\n\r\n- Improve `RandomTuner` to generate non-repetitive random indices in constant time without increasing memory usage.\r\n\r\n- Unit tests.","created_at":"2020-02-12T18:37:34Z","updated_at":"2020-02-17T16:41:54Z","closed_at":"2020-02-15T04:15:48Z","merged_at":"2020-02-15T04:15:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"feda150e34a79af3ea688ab27f9742720390b1e2","assignee":{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"merrymercy","id":15100009,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MTAwMDA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15100009?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy","html_url":"https://github.com/merrymercy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/merrymercy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858780915,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3ODA5MTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20need%20review","name":"status:

picked PR from (PR #4548).\r\n\r\nThis adds Windows support to the C++ RPC server.\r\nTo enable building it make sure the CMake option USE_CXX_RPC is set to ON.\r\n\r\nNotables:\r\n\r\n- To workaround the lack for fork() sys call in Windows, the RPC socket is passed (WSADuplicateSocket magic) to a new child process.\r\n- To workaround the lack of tar on Windows, wsl must be installed as tar is executed with \"wsl tar -C...\"\r\n- Clang is used for compilation, so make sure[ LLVM binaries are installed ](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)and in the system path.\r\n- Updated CMakeLists.txt to use v3.9 on Windows to use INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION for better optimization of the libraries tvm.dll and topi.dll.  \r\n- CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS is used on the tvm_runtime.dll so exports always work when using the graph runtime from C++ projects.\r\n\r\nI have not verified I have not broken the Linux build of this in some way.  Certain liberties were also taken as I didn't expect to ever be making this PR, so apologies :)\r\n\r\nTo debug, I use these command args:\r\n\r\nserver --host=10.1.30.5 --port=9000 --port-end=9090
