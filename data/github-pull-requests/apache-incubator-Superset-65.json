When the user clicks the caret section of the button, they can now save the query as a dataset.\r\n\r\n`Bonus`: In order to create this button, I conveniently needed to fix the styling on the \"Run\" query split button.

 - Both of these modals should be fully functional\r\n- From SqlLab, open a query for a database that does NOT have \"Allow this database to be explored\" enabled.\r\n  - Observe that the save button is a normal button, not split\r\n    - Clicking this button should show the save query modal\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

SUMMARY\r\nReopen https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20668\r\n\r\nCurrently when user open Explore, we always send a request to `/v1/explore` endpoint, which assembles Explore initial data - slice, form_data and datasource.\r\nWhen user goes to Explore from Dashboard (by clicking \"Edit chart\" or chart title), most of the data needed to assemble Explore should already be available in Redux store.\r\nThis PR implements using data from Dashboard Redux store to initialize Explore without calling `/v1/explore` endpoint.\r\n\r\nIf user opens Explore from Dashboard, check if slice, formData, datasourceId and datasourceType are available. If they are, fetch datasource metadata and hydrate Explore using slice, formData and datasource.\r\nIf they are not available, call `/v1/explore` and hydrate Explore.\r\n\r\nWe can't reuse datasource from Dashboard. Datasources metadata on Dashboard is trimmed so that datasource contains only columns and metrics used by charts on that dashboard. In Explore we need to be able to access all columns and metrics, which means we must fetch those from API.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Go to dashboard\r\n2. Click \"Edit chart\"\r\n3. Verify that Explore has opened correctly and that we did not call `/v1/explore/` endpoint\r\n4. Enter Explore from any other entry point (for example Charts list or Welcome page)\r\n5. Verify that we do call `/v1/explore`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user zoomed out the browser (could repro only in Chrome, Safari and Firefox worked fine), titles of some charts would truncate. That's because for some reason (probably browser bug) the input container decreased it's width by 0.01px.\r\nAlso, confirmed that it's always just 0.01px, so this PR simply adds 1px to the input container as a failsafe.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"492\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/180797200-591ab270-8505-4ecb-ad32-3a155bc9f031.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"559\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/180796474-3b10989a-0d64-4051-be88-adcad5d6d397.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open Explore, zoom out Chrome (with cmd -)\r\n2.

SUMMARY\r\nThe problem is that when the table is rendering our `useResizeDetector` triggers changes to hide the scrollbar if necessary which causes that width and height from props are always changing and the component enters into an infinite loop. We are detecting the changes and applying the resize only if the new difference (any) is not related to the scrollbar size.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/180527280-ba6a8225-99d0-424d-817a-5b742de1e365.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/180527869-0315ffaa-1e4e-4453-b33c-2966d141ac76.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nDefining a label to the time column on the dataset level breaks the axis values displayed on the chart, in case the `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature flag enabled.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that, by changing the label, we're failing to calculate the proper type of the x axis column, since the dataType mapping is done with the original axis value.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/180376109-403d63c4-c293-4af1-9cab-008332480965.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/180376182-c5403433-df9c-4e50-8cbe-c017bbf47b29.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Create a **Bar Chart v2** using the `Vehicle Sales` dataset.\r\n2. Set **Month** as the granularity.\r\n3. Set `order_date` as the X Axis.\r\n4. Set `sum(price_each)` as the metric. \r\n5. Click on **CREATE CHART**.\r\n6. Note that the months are properly displayed on the X Axis. \r\n7. Click on the three ellipses next to the dataset name > **Edit dataset**.\r\n8. Navigate to the **COLUMNS** tab.\r\n9. Expand the `order_date` column.\r\n10. Set date as a label for this column.\r\n11. Click on **SAVE**.\r\n12. Click on **OK**.\r\n\r\nEnsure **Months** are still properly displayed on the X Axis.\r\n \r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\nFixes #20074\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nDepending on the number of queries being executed for a given chart, we are displaying the results in panels at the bottom (explore).\r\nThis causes some issues, because the \"Show Totals\" and pagination features add extra queries, leading, for instance, a table to display more than one result panel, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe same issue appears for the chart empty state, since having multiple queries can make the state not to appear, as expected.\r\n\r\nWe currently have a `getQueryCount` util that is used in some (but not all) places. This PR moves that value to the chart metadata and then queries it in all the necessary places to solve the issue mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/180353269-f5d599ec-d7dd-4a2e-9a3a-d792847916fc.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/180353372-60e2ff11-fcd1-4fa7-8c6e-2103d6aa4faa.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Create a chart table\r\n2. Enable Show Totals\r\n3. Update the chart\r\n\r\nEnsure the results panel show only a single result.\r\nRepeat the process above, but for a Mixed Timeseries chart. Ensure you can see two results panels.\r\n\r\nFor the chart above, add some filters that would yield no results.\r\nUpdate the chart and ensure you can see the empty state.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-07-22T03:04:11Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T18:21:32Z","closed_at":"2022-07-22T06:58:43Z","merged_at":"2022-07-22T06:58:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"279ab954b1977f7729442733a31c67715476a620","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1329203144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzI5MjAzMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/M","name":"size/M","color":"705FA3","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6575674535,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABh_DUpw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.1.0","name":"üö¢

SUMMARY\r\nTo preserve bookmarked URLs this PR redirects old Explore URLs in the format `/superset/explore` to the new one without the `/superset` prefix. This only affects `GET` operations. We only preserved the `POST` operation in case anyone is using it for something. In any case, this endpoint will be deleted in 3.0 as the warning clearly states.\r\n\r\nFollow-up of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20572\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCheck if old Explore URLs are redirected to the new ones with all parameters preserved.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [

consistently handle rollbacks when an error occurs. Throughout the code there's inconsistent logic of the form:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:    \r\n    if commit:\r\n        db.session.commit()\r\nexcept SQLAlchemyError as ex:\r\n    db.session.rollback()\r\n```\r\n\r\nas well as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:    \r\n    if commit:\r\n        db.session.commit()\r\nexcept SQLAlchemyError as ex:\r\n    if commit:\r\n        db.session.rollback()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR‚Äîby way of `git grep -B 1 rollback`‚Äîremoves the unnecessary `if commit` checkout before a rollback because we want to rollback any operation which failed‚Äîpre commit‚Äîin the transaction regardless of whether we're planning to commit, i.e., save the state. \r\n\r\nRegarding commits per [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-commit-and-rollback-in-sql/) it's worth noting that once committed a rollback is not viable.\r\n\r\n> The transaction can not undo changes after COMMIT execution.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves a performance regression introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20473. Previously only the new columns/metrics where returned via the `update_columns` and `update_metrics` methods respectively‚Äîwhich were defined as properties of the dataset and then bound to the table via the DAO [update](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/dao/base.py#L155-L172). I also re-introduced the commit to both methods as one likely would expect these methods to commit rather than waiting for the `update` commit. Note the previous optimization exists, i.e., the commit occurs at the end rather than for each create, update, or delete.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20473 both new and existing columns were returned which added unnecessary overhead. Furthermore I'm not sure how complex a SQLAlchemy ORM model update with relationships is,  i.e., where it tries to re-update all the columns and metrics, but given we already have dedicated methods to \"update\" columns/metrics‚Äîactually create, update, and delete‚Äîit seems simpler/clearer to bind new columns/metrics to the parent table on create and exclude all columns/metrics when updating the dataset model, i.e., previously it wasn't overly clear from the code‚Äîwithout digging‚Äîwhy the `update_columns` and `update_metrics`  were returning a subset of entities.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER

SUMMARY\r\nUsers of Superset might not want to give the ability to embed charts, especially as embedding uses iFrames that might be disabled for security reasons. This PR adds a `EMBEDDABLE_CHARTS` flag to the config to enable/disable embedding charts.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nEnable tracking URL for Presto and Trino (previously it is only available for Hive queries) and also change `TRACKING_URL_TRANSFORMER` to run at runtime (as opposed to when queries are fetched) so that we can display different tracking URL based on query age (most tracking URLs will expire after a certain amount of time---in Trino/Preso, this is configured by [`query.min-expire-age`](https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/properties-query-management.html#query-min-expire-age).\r\n\r\nHad to update query execution logics to add end time for failed executions, too.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging, I also realized the TIMED_OUT status isn't actually in use---and now the frontend also cannot handle that status. We should probably add it back, but let's save it for another PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nWhen queries are still running:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"746\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/180104968-4bf67e62-5b7f-4105-bebb-a1f5d6f8ccc5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will now display the tracking url even for failed jobs, this is useful for users to debug their failed queries:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"837\" alt=\"Xnip2022-07-20_14-46-55\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/335541/180104883-b13f72b4-4a88-443d-aa15-cf39edf7715f.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Connect to a Presto or Trino dataset and run some long-running or erroneous queries\r\n2. Optionally, update Superset config to test customize `TRACKING_URL_TRANSFORMER`. For example, following setting will only display tracking urls for queries finished within the last 5 minutes:\r\n   ```python\r\n    def TRACKING_URL_TRANSFORMER(url: str, query: \"Query\") -> Optional[str]:\r\n        if not query.end_time or (\r\n            now_as_float() - float(query.end_time)\r\n            < timedelta(minutes=5).total_seconds() * 1000\r\n        ):\r\n            return re.sub(\r\n                r\"^https?://([^/]+)/\", \"https://trino.datalake.example.org/\", url\r\n            )\r\n        return None\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!---

href=\"https://github.com/terser/terser/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\">terser's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v4.8.1 (backport)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Security fix for RegExps that should not be evaluated (regexp DDOS)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.8.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for numeric separators (<code>million = 1_000_000</code>) was added.</li>\n<li>Assigning properties to a class is now assumed to be pure.</li>\n<li>Fixed bug where <code>yield</code> wasn't considered a valid property key in generators.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.7.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A bug was fixed where an arrow function would have the wrong size</li>\n<li><code>arguments</code> object is now considered safe to retrieve properties from (useful for <code>length</code>, or <code>0</code>) even when <code>pure_getters</code> is not set.</li>\n<li>Fixed erroneous <code>const</code> declarations without value (which is invalid) in some corner cases when using <code>collapse_vars</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.6.13</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed issue where ES5 object properties were being turned into ES6 object properties due to more lax unicode rules.</li>\n<li>Fixed parsing of BigInt with lowercase <code>e</code> in them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.6.12</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed subtree comparison code, making it see that <code>[1,[2, 3]]</code> is different from <code>[1, 2, [3]]</code></li>\n<li>Printing of unicode identifiers has been improved</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.6.11</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Read unused classes' properties and method keys, to figure out if they use other variables.</li>\n<li>Prevent inlining into block scopes when there are name collisions</li>\n<li>Functions are no longer inlined into parameter defaults, because they live in their own special scope.</li>\n<li>When inlining identity functions, take into account the fact they may be used to drop <code>this</code> in function calls.</li>\n<li>Nullish coalescing operator (<code>x ?? y</code>), plus basic optimization for it.</li>\n<li>Template literals in binary expressions such as <code>+</code> have been further optimized</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.6.10</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not use reduce_vars when classes are present</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.6.9</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Check if block scopes actually exist in blocks</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.6.8</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Take into account &quot;executed bits&quot; of classes like static properties or computed keys, when checking if a class evaluation might throw or have side effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v4.6.7</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Some new performance gains through a <code>AST_Node.size()</code> method which measures a node's source code length without printing it to a string first.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe essence of this problem is the inconsistency between the width and height of the parent container and the actual echart resize. Since our outer layer is based on `useResizeDetector` to debounce the width and height change, there is a probability of inconsistency, so we do not put `useEffect` here to ensure that resize and render execution are idempotent.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/179942307-6802c033-a164-4acf-8ad1-5c810e36927e.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### after\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/179941959-f0580456-584d-4c26-953f-b6e8cda2d4cf.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20761, changing `Slice.query_context` and `Slice.params` to `MEDIUMTEXT` for MySQL databases. Ideally this should be ran before #20359 and #20346 but that would mean rebasing the existing migrations, which could be problematic for users who already ran both migrations.\r\n\r\nWe'll just accept the risk that some MySQL users may lose `query_context` data if they didn't manually run this column type change before #20359 and #20346...\r\n\r\nOn Airbnb's Superset instance with about 350k slices, this migration completes in about 50 seconds.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe current native filterbar section is fixed size.\r\nSince the filter is not wide enough for moderately wide data to be seen, some filter value with the long overlapped prefix string such like the following case truncated with the repeated strings.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"262\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-07-14 at 1 46 21 PM\"

experience.\r\nThe dropdown needs to be widened over the sidebar but the dropdown also truncated under the sidebar to fix the  https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19399 \r\n\r\n<img width=\"348\"

sidebar resizable to be widened itself.\r\nThis commit adds the Resizable panel for native filterbar to adjust the width wider to help this inconvenient case.\r\nIt also stores the adjusted width for individual dashboard in localStorage to memorize the state.\r\n\r\nAddition to the feature, this commit also migrates DashboardBuilder test code to testing-library, jest and typescript to enable emotion test helpers.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

this command now\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because updating objects within `iter_per` does not work with MySQL cursors. I guess the MySQL client just doesn't like writing while reading. (Maybe other databases will have similar issues if anyone with more than 1,000 area charts can test?)\r\n\r\nWe've seen this error before, which was why [`paginated_update`](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/cadd259788c99415862cef7e8a5da9aaf4ed12cd/superset/migrations/shared/utils.py#L94) was introduced. Instead of streaming results with cursors, `paginated_update` which runs manual pagination with `OFFSET` and `LIMIT`, which makes sure read and write operations happen independently. \r\n\r\nWhile optimizing this, I also did some other refactoring for the migration_viz class. Most notably, I relocated the files (and the corresponding tests) from superset root to `superset.migrations` as migration code should be as self-contained and as stable as possible. Anything under the root directory is considered app code, and app code can be updated much more frequently.\r\n\r\nWhile testing, I also noticed that some charts will fail at reloading `query_context` as the combined JSON payload is too large for a default Text column in MySQL (which has max size of 64kb). The `upgrade` was not able to save the full serialized JSON string---then `downgrade` would fail. We need to migrate both `Slice.query_context` and `Slice.params` to `MediumText`, which I will address in another PR. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING

https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20151 wasn't suffice is the result set was stored prior to downloading the CSV file. More specifically Pandas coerces an integer array with `None` to a float‚Äîlikely because of the Numpy coercion, i.e., \r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> pd.DataFrame.from_records([{\"foo\": 1}, {\"foo\": None}])\r\n   foo\r\n0  1.0\r\n1  NaN\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix is to explicitly define the dtype, using the standard DataFrame constructor, i.e., \r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> pd.DataFrame(data=[{\"foo\": 1}, {\"foo\": None}], dtype=object)\r\n    foo\r\n0     1\r\n1  None\r\n```\r\n\r\nLong term we should probably replace quirky Pandas with PyArrow globally.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe `PrestoEngineSpec._show_columns` method stated it returned a `List[RowProxy]` type however it actually returned a `ResultProxy`, i.e., per the SQLAlchemy [documentation](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/connections.html),\r\n\r\n> The [RowProxy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/connections.html?highlight=rowproxy#sqlalchemy.engine.RowProxy) object is retrieved from a database result, from the [ResultProxy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/connections.html?highlight=rowproxy#sqlalchemy.engine.ResultProxy) object using methods like [ResultProxy.fetchall()](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/connections.html?highlight=rowproxy#sqlalchemy.engine.ResultProxy.fetchall).\r\n\r\nFrom a coding perspective this wasn't problematic as the output is later processed via, \r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor column in PrestoEngineSpec._show_columns(...):\r\n ....\r\n```\r\n\r\nand though the `ResultProxy` supports iteration (per the DB API), it does not support pickling (and thus caching) whereas the `RowProxy` does (it's acts somewhat akin to a Python `tuple`). This was resulting in an issue at Airbnb where we actually override and cache the `PrestoEngineSpec._show_columns` using a user lock to help reduce the number of queries we send to Presto.\r\n\r\nThe fix is merely to augment the method to return a `List[RowProxy]` as promised rather than a `ResultProxy`. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently when user clicks \"Edit chart\" or chart's title in Dashboard page, we first send a POST request to retrieve form_data_key, then create an Explore URL with that form_data_key and redirect to Explore. We do that in order to pass dashboard context (such as native filters, cross filter, color scheme...) to Explore.\r\nThere are several problems with this approach:\r\n\r\n- we redirect to another page, so from semantic HTML point of view this element should be a link\r\n- user can't access standard link contextual menu when right clicking\r\n- there's a noticeable delay between a click and redirection because of HTTP request being made in the middle\r\n- we unnecessarily take up space in redis\r\n\r\nIn order to refactor \"Edit chart\" to be a link, we need to pass dashboard context in a different way.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the following changes:\r\n\r\n- save current dashboard state in local storage, where random id generated on Dashboard mount is a key and stringified state is a value\r\n- update the value in local storage on each dashboard state change (such as applying new native filter or cross filter or changing color scheme)\r\n- \"Edit chart\"/chart title is a React Router Link and it contains local storage key as a search param\r\n- when mounting Explore, retrieve the dashboard state from local storage using the dashboard id search param and merge it with form data coming from initializing Explore request\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/179526015-608cef82-85fd-432c-aa5b-57f563cd5e0b.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open dashboard\r\n2. Apply native filters, cross filters, filter box filters\r\n3. Open Explore by clicking on chart title or clicking \"Edit chart\". Try opening in the same tab and opening in a new tab\r\n4. Verify that filters from dashboard are present in Explore\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR allows to adjust Gunicorn max_requests and max_requests_jitter which allows to restart the Gunicorn worker process periodically.\r\n\r\nThis is a simple method to help limit the damage of memory leaks like one reported in [15132](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15132). \r\n\r\nFor more details, Please refer to: https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#max-requests\r\n\r\nDefault values are set to zero to match gunicorn's default i.e. automatic worker restarts are disabled by default.\r\n\r\nNote: This change is non-disruptive, no end user will be impacted unless they turn on settings.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a drill-to-detail modal.  It adds a \"Drill to detail\" menu item to dashboard charts' contextual menus and also completes support for opening the modal by right-clicking on chart features.  The drill-to-detail modal allows users to inspect the data that is backing a chart from the dashboard that the chart is on, while optionally applying filters based on where in the chart was clicked.\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n- Unlike the Samples pane, the drill-to-detail modal content is server-paginated and allows paging through all rows of data.\r\n- All columns of the dataset are displayed.\r\n- Native dashboard filters, cross-filters, ad-hoc chart filters and time chart filters are transparently respected; only rows matching those filters are displayed in the modal table.\r\n- The chart menu item and contextual menus appear when the `DRILL_TO_DETAIL` feature flag is enabled.\r\n- Only ECharts (excluding Tree Chart) are currently supported for contextual menu access.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nMenu item:\r\n![localhost_9000_superset_dashboard_births__native_filters_key=7menIfx9h9P-xFkGBuKMFYlgho-hubMp7tZVmWyfTDwRyNH5UgdFt1pGo8-RJIw-](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/183224639-1d268a97-b1c8-48fe-b042-822bba23e047.png)\r\n\r\nModal:\r\n![localhost_9000_superset_dashboard_births__native_filters_key=7menIfx9h9P-xFkGBuKMFYlgho-hubMp7tZVmWyfTDwRyNH5UgdFt1pGo8-RJIw- (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/183224648-53fa05f4-c134-4dd2-8c4d-faf96fbc4d7e.png)\r\n\r\nModal w/ native filters:\r\n![localhost_9000_superset_dashboard_births__native_filters_key=7menIfx9h9P-xFkGBuKMFYlgho-hubMp7tZVmWyfTDwRyNH5UgdFt1pGo8-RJIw- (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/183224625-67a21bcb-599a-42b3-b76b-7a9804d13aab.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Ensure no change to contextual menu without feature flag set\r\n- With feature flag set, compare expected datasource results to drill to detail results in the following circumstances:\r\n  - No filters from chart or dashboard context\r\n  - Chart time filters\r\n  - Chart ad-hoc filters\r\n  - Dashboard native filters\r\n  - Dashboard cross-filters\r\n- Ensure that paginated results in modal work as expected in the following circumstances:\r\n  - No results\r\n  - One page of results\r\n  - Multiple pages of results\r\n  - Few columns\r\n  - Lots of columns\r\n- Check that right-clicking parts of charts opens the appropriate filters\r\n  - See below for list of charts that are supported\r\n  - Try \"Drill to detail\", \"Drill by X\" and \"Drill by all\" options\r\n  - Try filtering by string values, number values, and date values\r\n  - Try clearing filters\r\n\r\n#### Charts supporting right-click:\r\n- Big number\r\n  - Right-click on number: Drill to detail\r\n- Big number with Trendline\r\n  - Right-click on number: Drill to detail\r\n  - Right-click on point on trendline: Drill by {date}\r\n- Box Plot\r\n  - Right-click on box: Drill by {dimension}\r\n- Funnel Chart\r\n  - Right-click on funnel segment: Drill by {dimension}\r\n- Gauge Chart\r\n  - Right-click on gauge segment or needle: Drill by {dimension}\r\n- Graph Chart\r\n  - Right-click on edge: Drill by {dimension}\r\n- Mixed Time-Series\r\n  - Right-click on point on line: Drill by {dimension}, Drill by {timestamp}, Drill by all\r\n- Pie Chart\r\n  - Right-click on pie segment: Drill by {dimension}\r\n- Radar Chart\r\n  - Right-click on dimension point: Drill by {dimension}\r\n- Time-series Chart\r\n    - Time-series Line Chart\r\n    - Time-series Area Chart\r\n    - Time-series Bar Chart v2\r\n    - Time-series Scatter Plot\r\n    - Time-series Smooth Line\r\n    - Time-series Stepped Line\r\n    - For all of these: Right-click on point on line: Drill by {dimension}, Drill by {timestamp}, Drill by all\r\n- Treemap v2\r\n  - Right-click on dimension title (for multiple-dimension treemaps): Drill by {dimension}\r\n  - Right-click on box: Drill by {dimension}, Drill by {addl dimension}, Drill by all\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nAs explained in #20702, when you select more than one table in SQL Lab and try to clear them all, then the component appears to be rerendering twice (or more).\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the tables are being removed one by one and, specially if the backend persistence is enabled, then, as the backend responds, the value of the select is updated only by that single table.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures all tables are deleted at once, preventing the issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe combination of #20498 and #20645 caused a regression in Explore logic such that when a chart is saved as a new chart, the chart wouldn't render once the modal was closed without clicking the \"Update Chart\" button.  This broke a Cypress test, `explore/link.test.ts` that's currently failing on master, but which wasn't picked up by CI before merge because CI on #20645 was run before #20498 had been merged and the two PRs didn't have any conflicts that would prompt GH to require a rebase.  This PR reverts a little bit of #20645, making the `HYDRATE_EXPLORE` Redux action once again update the `datasources` store key in the same step instead of in a different step.  I don't really understand why this change fixes the issue, but it seems like the Explore components only refresh as expected if `datasources` is updated as part of the `HYDRATE_EXPLORE` action.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/178867373-61856316-c0b5-434f-a62b-a91801da183e.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/178867380-54804f8b-4f64-4d69-9f3a-a33e07133078.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nDue to the fact that dashboards use trimmed datasets (they only contain columns used by charts on that dashboard), we can't reuse them in Explore. This PR fixes that behaviour.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a \"subset\" of PR https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20699 which fixes the same thing, but also introduces a code refactor. CI was failing on that PR, and since it's an urgent bug I decided to open a smaller PR to quickly fix the issue.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/178796194-234da0de-b867-4696-b387-8987c74ee518.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/178796053-71909bb2-f68c-4298-a3b6-e6730bd41164.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThere's a race condition when hydrating the dashboard that's causing the native filters to be treated as out of scope.\r\nThe original issue was found and fixed by #17084 by ensuring the hydration happened before the active tabs were set.\r\n\r\nHowever, this #19983 caused a regression by passing to the hydration function an empty array for the active tabs, causing it to override what's already in the state. The state could already have the tabs set cause the function that calls the hydration is under an async callback, un thus could be slower.\r\n\r\nBy passing undefined as the active tabs (the normal scenario), the issue is solved.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/178627163-7fe7a8ff-c2d6-4bb8-9e1c-23e1f32ee80c.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/178627188-42c84e52-259a-4e17-bca2-02800f919356.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Create 2 charts\r\n2. Create a dashboard with 2 tabs\r\n3. Add 1st chart to 1st tab, 2nd chart to 2nd tab\r\n4. Create a native filter (e.g. value filter), save the changes and revisit the dashboard\r\n5. Pay attention to the native filter\r\n\r\nNote that the issue happens on revisit, the first time around it works.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports

the code for Select and AsyncSelect was split into two separate components: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20466\r\nThe components were left identical, so this PR continues the work and removes the unecessary code that was left in each of the components. Namely, it removes behaviour that had previously been determined by whether the component was in async mode or not. \r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nOn a tabbed dashboard, ‚Äúrefresh dashboard‚Äù only refreshes the active tab.\r\nDue to performance, charts are not rerendered if their visibility changes, so when switching tabs, you'll get the old values back.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows the rerendering of the chart if the status changed from the loading status.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/178557703-b60e4bb3-0e76-44b9-92e7-6f88f3d5b253.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/178558754-bba34095-0f29-4ce5-94ce-54c136e029ba.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Create a dataset from SQL lab that can easily be changed `Select 1 as \"Test\"`\r\n2. Save the chart created from that SQL.\r\n3. Create a Dashboard with 2 tabs\r\n4. Add any chart to the first tab and the one created in 2 to the second tab.\r\n\r\nWhen you load the dashboard and open the tab from the first time, it should show the value correctly.\r\n\r\n5. Make sure you visit both tabs, then go back to the first one\r\n6. Change the dataset to `Select 2 as \"Test\"`\r\n7. Refresh the dashboard\r\n8. Go to the second tab\r\n\r\nThe chart should display the updated data.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ]

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe reason is that the formula annotation is added to the formula calculation based on the value of the x-axis, which was previously
