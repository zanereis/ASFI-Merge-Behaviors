change tightens up the Mongo connection UX:\r\n\r\n* The `MongoHook` constructor validates the connection object to ensure it is of the correct `conn_type` (`mongo`), raising an exception otherwise\r\n* If the user have set the scheme/conn_type to `mongodb+srv`, the constructor exception provides an informative message telling the user to use the `mongo` conn_type and set `srv=true` in the `extras`\r\n* The UI has been expanded with special boolean widgets for the supported `srv`, `ssl` and `allow_insecure` extra parameters\r\n\r\nThis is a replacement for #41371 which aimed to improve the Mongo connection parameters in a different and less-functional way.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the

moved to a model where DagRun level events utilize ProcessPoolExecutor to send data, to not do this on the direct scheduler process.

ProcessPoolExecutor complete - this allows listener to log potential serialization failures.\r\n- guard whole listener with BaseException checks - we don't want errors to bubble to

This results in the log on line 161 being printed as \r\n\r\n > Submit job xxx to # an empty url\r\n\r\nwhich doesn’t make sense.

PR is related to the upgrade of google-ads dependency. There is a new API version on Google Ads API and Google Ads API tends to deprecate too quickly. So we are trying to increase the dependency version to match with the latest version.\r\n\r\nSince we mostly use the types from the underlying library it is safe to upgrade. Also the users can give specific API version to override default value and use the previous API versions.\r\n\r\nHere is the \"Deprecation and sunset page\" of Google Ads API: https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/sunset-dates.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR introduces unification for deprecation messages formatting within Google's provider package by following:\r\n\r\n1. Updated the pre-commit hook `check-code-deprecations` so it enforces a specific message structure containing the end of life date for the deprecated entity. According to the deprecation policy discussed [here](https://lists.apache.org/thread/d4vvr1z2bcpp1zg4rdv4p6dccrlg17g8), this deadline doesn't enforce removal of the deprecated entity from the source code, it only increases transparency and predictability for users, so they knew how much time do they have for the changes on their side.\r\n2. Another reason for this change is preparation for the cleaning-up process as Google's provider package has collected a lot of old legacy code and we'd be happy to finally clean it up.\r\n3. These changes work only within an `airflow/providers/google` scope. \r\n4. The default EOL is at least six months ahead.\r\n5. Some classes and methods have assigned earlier deadlines because they have been deprecated for a very long time already and can be removed earlier or their API is shut down and they are not working already.

When unloading data to S3, one can either pass custom select_query or provide schema and table so that default query is created (SELECT * FROM {self.schema}.{self.table}). After validation to some parameters has been added in #37861, when custom query is provided together with schema and table it's being overwritten by default query.

Upon closer inspection together with @Artuz37 we found out that some edge cases do not allow us to deduce the schema and column level lineage on s3 file, and the wildcard char in S3 does not work like some may expect, so we adjusted the OpenLineage extraction to provide only reliable lineage.

In practice the Celery workers will be few in number and probably need more CPU and memory since they will handle multiple tasks, while the Kubernetes workers will be many in number and need much less CPU and memory. However, with the current one-size-fits-both approach, Kubernetes worker pods have to wait to get scheduled because of high initial resource requests.\r\n\r\ncloses: #28880\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an

Added a new configuration option `call_on_kill_on_dagrun_timeout` to control whether tasks should be killed when a DAG run times out (default: False).\r\n2. Updated logic in `_schedule_dag_run` to call task `on_kill` if  `call_on_kill_on_dagrun_timeout` is enabled.\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/41036\r\n\r\nTesting:\r\n- Added unit test for the new timeout handling logic\r\n- Verified that the new configuration option works as

PR adds a callback to process messages from an Azure Service Bus. \r\n\r\nRight now, on main, the Azure Service Bus message receiver simply logs the messages received and returns. This PR preserves that default, but adds the ability to pass in a callback function with the signature ServiceBusMessage -> None which is applied to each message received.\r\n\r\nThis change is made to both the general receiver and the subscription receiver.\r\n\r\nI'd like someone from the Airflow community to weigh in on if this is a good solution. To me, it seemed like the least intrusive way to add a hook to obtain the message contents. However, I'm not sure if it plays well with the Airflow Operator standards as I've barely been using Airflow for a month.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you see any errors, omissions, or if I'm headed in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nThank
