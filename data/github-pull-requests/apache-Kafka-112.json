patch attempts to enforce a strict order to flush the state store only after ongoing transaction gets committed under EOS. Major changes include:\r\n\r\n- Rewrite `StreamTask.commit` to separate EOS and non EOS commit scenario\r\n- Under EOS,  we make the atomic operation in the following order: commit ongoing transaction, flush the store, begin another transaction. This means there is no intermediate data left within the cache and the ongoing modification to the state store only gets visible after the transaction gets committed.\r\n- Add a `bounded` config on the stream thread cache to reject further writes. This feature is important as under EOS the thread cache is the only container we are going to leverage. When the cache is almost full, it will begin throwing a `CacheFullException` to the caller.\r\n- In ProcessorContext, handle `CacheFullException` by requesting a task commit in next round. This should only be needed on ReadWrite access to state stores for general put operation, and avoiding further interruption to the application.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

been encountering some build instability that appears to be due to the `RebalanceSourceConnectorsIntegrationTest` class. Somehow, that test is causing an ungraceful shutdown of one or more of its embedded Connect workers, which then in turn invoke `Exit::exit`. The Connect integration test framework has support for overriding the behavior of `Exit::exit` to prevent it from calling `System::exit`; the changes here use that feature to help bring back build stability.\r\nNow, if the embedded Connect worker fails to shut down gracefully, a warning is logged but the test still passes and (more importantly), `System::exit` is never invoked.\r\n\r\nIf approved, this fix should be backported through to 2.3, when the test was introduced.\r\n\r\nTested locally 10x over with all integration tests. No other test appears to be invoking `Exit::exit`, so I've restricted the scope of the changes here to just the

test was taking more than 5 minutes because the producer writes were timing out. The problem was that broker 100 was being shutdown before broker 101, which meant that the partition was still offline after broker 100 was restarted. The producer timeouts were not detected because the produce future was not checked. After the fix, test time drops to about 15s.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

The cause is the missing `.git` directory from which the commit ID is extracted and written to the properties file by gradle.\r\n\r\nBoth issues are fixed by adding the file to

system tests `test_rebalance_[simple|complex]` failed\r\nrepeatedly with a verfication error. The cause was most probably\r\nthe missing clean-up of a state directory of one of the processors.\r\n\r\nA node is cleaned up when a service on that node is started and when \r\na test is torn down.\r\n\r\nIf the clean-up flag `clean_node_enabled` of a EOS Streams service is \r\nunset, the clean-up of the node is skipped.\r\n\r\nThe clean-up flag of `processor1` in the EOS tests should stay set before\r\nits first start, so that the node is cleaned before the service is started.\r\nAfterwards for the multiple restarts of `processor1` the cleans-up flag should\r\nbe unset to re-use the local state.\r\n\r\nAfter the multiple restarts are done, the clean-up flag of processor1 should\r\nagain be set to trigger node clean-up during the test teardown.\r\n\r\nA dirty node can lead to test failures when tests from Streams EOS tests are\r\nscheduled on the same node, because the state store would not start empty\r\nsince it reads the local state that was not cleaned up.\r\n\r\n###

a number of last minute bugs were found stemming from the incremental closing of lost tasks in StreamsRebalanceListener#onPartitionsLost, a safer approach to this edge case seems warranted. We initially wanted to be as \"future-proof\" as possible, and avoid baking further protocol assumptions into the code that may be broken as the protocol evolves. This meant that rather than simply closing all active tasks and clearing all associated state in `#onPartitionsLost(lostPartitions)` we would loop through the lostPartitions/lost tasks and remove them one by one from the various data structures/assignments, then verify that everything was empty in the end. This verification in particular has caused us significant trouble, as it turns out to be nontrivial to determine what should in fact be empty, and if so whether it is also being correctly updated.\r\n\r\nTherefore, before worrying about it being \"future-proof\" it seems we should make sure it is \"present-day-proof\" and implement this callback in the safest possible way, by blindly clearing and closing all active task state. We log all the relevant state (at debug level) before clearing it, so we can at least tell from the logs whether/which emptiness checks were being violated.\r\n\r\nNote that this is targeted at 2.4 (not trunk) and that I also picked over the minor fix from

producer state expiration uses timestamps from data records only and not from transaction markers. This can cause premature producer expiration when the coordinator times out a transaction because we drop the state from existing batches. This in turn can allow the coordinator epoch to revert to a previous value, which can lead to validation failures during log recovery. This patch fixes the problem by also leveraging the timestamp from transaction markers. \r\n\r\nWe also change the validation logic so that coordinator epoch is verified only for new marker appends. When replicating from the leader and when recovering the log, we only log a warning if we notice that the coordinator epoch has gone backwards. This allows recovery from previous occurrences of this bug.\r\n\r\nFinally, this patch fixes one minor issue when loading producer state from the snapshot file. When the only record for a given producer is a control record, the \"last offset\" field will be set to -1 in the snapshot. We should check for this case when loading to be sure we recover the state consistently.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [

`java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: java.lang.AssertionError: Close finished too quickly 5999`.\r\n\r\nThe close test sets a close duration in milliseconds, but measures the time taken in nanoseconds. This leads to small error due to the resolution in each, where the close is deemed to have taken too little time.\r\n\r\nWhen I measured the start and end with nanoTime, I found the time taken to close was `5999641566 ns (5999.6ms)` which seems close enough to be a resolution error. I've run the test 50 times and have not hit the \"Close finished too quickly\" issue again, whereas previously I hit a failure pretty quickly.","created_at":"2019-11-12T21:11:48Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T22:58:06Z","closed_at":"2019-11-14T08:17:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b3daa0c6d20558b68b85a9f3fe0ccab1adf0fc0c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7683/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7683/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7683/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c2f1fb4ac5246e60dc519aa36b62f36cdcb6fd43","head":{"label":"lbradstreet:flaky-consumer-bounce-test","ref":"flaky-consumer-bounce-test","sha":"c2f1fb4ac5246e60dc519aa36b62f36cdcb6fd43","user":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154184520,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQxODQ1MjA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"lbradstreet/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet/kafka","description":"Mirror

Introduce `gradlewAll` script to replace `*All` tasks since the approach\r\nused by the latter doesn't work since Gradle 6.0 and it's unclear when,\r\nif ever, it will work again ( see https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/11301).\r\n* Update release script and README given the above.\r\n* Update zinc to 1.3.5.\r\n* Update gradle-versions-plugin to 0.28.0.\r\n\r\nThe major improvements in Gradle 6.0 to 6.3 are:\r\n- Improved incremental compilation for Scala\r\n- Support for Java 14 (although some Gradle plugins\r\nlike spotBugs may need to be updated or disabled,\r\nwill do that separately)\r\n- Improved scalac reporting, warnings are clearly\r\nmarked as such, which is very helpful.\r\n\r\nTested `gradlewAll` manually for the commands listed in the README\r\nand release script. For `uploadArchive`, I tested it with a local Maven\r\nrepository.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2019-11-11T14:38:21Z","updated_at":"2020-04-20T02:24:26Z","closed_at":"2020-04-20T02:24:22Z","merged_at":"2020-04-20T02:24:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"d6da0452b6b14be81076d82a257381d42c515e08","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7677/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7677/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7677/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/c51b96c503445009f510f19d5d26ca52fb50ba7f","head":{"label":"ijuma:gradle-6.0","ref":"gradle-6.0","sha":"c51b96c503445009f510f19d5d26ca52fb50ba7f","user":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32646946,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjY0Njk0Ng==","name":"kafka","full_name":"ijuma/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma/kafka","description":"Mirror

change fixes a performance regression due to follower last seen highwatermark handling introduced in 23beeea34bf9e5e7a33dc0566d54a17b2b417c0f. maybeUpdateHwAndSendResponse is expensive for brokers with high partition counts, as it requires a partition and a replica lookup for every partition being fetched. This refactor moves the last seen watermark update into the follower fetch state update where we have already looked up the partition and replica.\r\n\r\nI've seen cases where maybeUpdateHwAndSendResponse is responsible 8% of CPU usage, not including the responseCallback call that is part of it.\r\n\r\nI have benchmarked this change with org.apache.kafka.jmh.partition.UpdateFollowerFetchStateBenchmark and it adds 5ns of overhead to Partition.updateFollowerFetchState, which is a rounding error compared to the current overhead of maybeUpdateHwAndSendResponse.","created_at":"2019-11-08T21:45:05Z","updated_at":"2019-11-13T05:21:19Z","closed_at":"2019-11-13T05:21:19Z","merged_at":"2019-11-13T05:21:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"1675115ec193acf4c7d44e68a57272edfec0b455","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7671/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7671/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7671/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bead21ceab782b159a6c0a83769d59a24df09e38","head":{"label":"lbradstreet:update-last-seen-hwm-perf","ref":"update-last-seen-hwm-perf","sha":"bead21ceab782b159a6c0a83769d59a24df09e38","user":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154184520,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQxODQ1MjA=","name":"kafka","full_name":"lbradstreet/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lbradstreet","id":252189,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MjE4OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/252189?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet","html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lbradstreet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lbradstreet/kafka","description":"Mirror

But these do not provide access to metadata so there is in fact a slight distinction between the two family of operators besides statefulness, and a reason to use transformers or processors besides needing state.","created_at":"2019-11-08T19:18:41Z","updated_at":"2019-11-10T06:43:43Z","closed_at":"2019-11-10T06:43:42Z","merged_at":"2019-11-10T06:43:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"1cd5d0da1d378c5dca059b9cba43a0358955d591","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7668/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/7668/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/7668/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/71cd6ad250d2e24b0ac3f6b1598ef7dba940c0c7","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:MINOR-clarify-transformer-statefulness","ref":"MINOR-clarify-transformer-statefulness","sha":"71cd6ad250d2e24b0ac3f6b1598ef7dba940c0c7","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror
