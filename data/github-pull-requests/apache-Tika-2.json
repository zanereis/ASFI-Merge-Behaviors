`log4j2.version` from 2.23.1 to 2.24.0.\nUpdates `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-bom` from 2.23.1 to 2.24.0\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/releases\">org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-bom's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>2.24.0</h2>\n<p>The <code>2.24.0</code> version of Log4j API has been enhanced with changes from the <code>3.x</code> branch and will be used by both Log4j 2 Core and Log4j 3 Core releases. The changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A faster default <code>ThreadContextMap</code>.</li>\n<li>Enhanced GraalVM support: native binaries that use Log4j API will no longer require additional GraalVM configuration.</li>\n<li>The configuration properties subsystem now only accepts the official pre-2.10 property names and the normalized post-2.10 names.\nCheck your configuration for typos.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/index.html\">Apache Log4j 2 website</a> has been almost entirely rewritten to provide improved documentation and faster access to the information you need.</p>\n<h3>Bridges</h3>\n<p>The JUL-to-Log4j API and Log4j 1-to-Log4j API will no longer be able to modify the configuration of Log4j Core by default.\nIf such a functionality is required, it must be explicitly enabled.</p>\n<h3>Modules</h3>\n<p>The following Log4j Core additional modules have been removed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>log4j-flume-ng</code>\nThe module is no longer part of the release process and will follow its own release lifecycle.\nPlease manage your dependencies using <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/components.html#log4j-bom\"><code>log4j-bom</code></a> to always use its latest version.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>log4j-kubernetes</code>\nThe module has been moved to the <a href=\"https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/main/doc/KubernetesLog4j.md\">Fabric8.io Kubernetes project</a> and follows the Fabric8.io release lifecycle.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>log4j-mongodb3</code>\nThe module based on MongoDB Java client version 3.x has been removed.\nPlease migrate to <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/components.html#log4j-mongodb\"><code>log4j-mongodb</code></a> (client version 5.x) or <a href=\"https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/components.html#log4j-mongodb4\"><code>log4j-mongodb4</code></a> (client version 4.x).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JMX changes</h3>\n<p>Starting in version 2.24.0, JMX support is disabled by default and can be re-enabled via the <code>log4j2.disableJmx=false</code> system property.</p>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a faster <code>DefaultThreadContextMap</code> implementation. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2330\">#2330</a>)</li>\n<li>Add Logback throwable-consuming semantics as an option in<code>log4j-slf4j-impl</code> and <code>log4j-slf4j2-impl</code>.\nUsers can enable it by setting the property <code>log4j2.messageFactory</code> to <code>org.apache.logging.slf4j.message.ThrowableConsumingMessageFactory</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2363\">#2363</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Add trace context fields to <code>GcpLayout.json</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/2498\">#2498</a>)</li>\n<li>Add <em>&quot;Plugin Reference&quot;</em> to the website. It is a Javadoc-on-steroids focusing on Log4j plugins. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1954\">#1954</a>)</li>\n<li>Automate website deployment using the new CI infrastructure shipped with <code>org.apache.logging:logging-parent:11.0.0</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>=== Changed</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix usage of <code>log4j-api</code> in GraalVM without additional reachability data. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/issues/1539\">#1539</a>)</li>\n<li>Ignore exceptions thrown by PropertySources. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/33450\">Spirng-33450</a>)</li>\n<li>Add logging to <code>PropertiesUtil</code> and fix <code>Duration</code> parser.
