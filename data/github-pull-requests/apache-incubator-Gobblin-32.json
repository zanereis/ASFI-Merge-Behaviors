Adding support for running JaCoCo and integration with Coveralls\n- JaCoCO can be run using `./gradlew test jacocoTestReport` which will generate JaCoCo reports for each individual Java subproject\n  - Output will be in `xml` and `html` format and can be found under `build/[subproject]/jacoco`\n- Adding the Gradle Plugin `jacoco-full-report`\n  - Docs: https://github.com/palantir/gradle-jacoco-coverage and https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.palantir.jacoco-coverage\n  - The default Gradle JaCoCo Plugin does not aggregate all reports into one single report, this is problematic as coveralls expects one aggregated report\n  - This plugin automatically does the aggregation and is configured in a similar way to the Gradle `jacoco` plugin\n  - It can be run using `./gradlew test jacocoFullReport`\n- The Travis build has been modified so that JaCoCo report is uploaded to coveralls\n- Coveralls Gobblin Page:

Overview\n- Initial commit for https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/issues/724\n- Migrating Gobblin documentation to MkDocs and ReadTheDocs\n- POC page: http://gobblin.readthedocs.org/en/readthedocs/\n- MkDocs is a tool for converting Markdown to HTML: http://www.mkdocs.org/\n- ReadTheDocs hosts documentation for free: https://readthedocs.org/\n- MkDocs uses Python Markdown rather than GitHub Flavored Markdown\n  - There are few relevant differences between the two outlined in the section below\n### Reviewing this PR\n- The important files for review are `mkdocs.yml`\n- All the `.md` files are copied from the GitHub wiki, with the main difference being all hard links to GitHub have been removed\n- All images on GitHub have also been uploaded\n### Advantages\n- All documentation is now checked in to the main branch under `gobblin-docs`\n- Users can now submit PRs for documentation\n- Docs automatically get updated on each commit\n### Python Markdown vs. GitHub Flavored Markdown\n- Python Markdown has a number of extensions that provide useful features\n  - For each `.md` file a `[TOC]` can be inserted to automatically generate a Table of Contents\n- Python Markdown requires two spaces before each list, this can be a little annoying as it generally requires inserting a new line before each list is created\n  - I have made the necessary updates to the current `.md` files\n- When creating a link in Python Markdown (e.g. `[page](link)`) a space cannot exist between `]` and `(` otherwise the link will not work\n### MkDocs\n- A master `mkdocs.yml` file is used to configure MkDocs\n- It allows additional custom css and javascript\n- The page also has a global Table of Contents that is rendered on each page\n- MkDocs integrates with Google Analytics too\n### ReadTheDocs\n- Each time a commit to the repo occurs, the docs are automatically updated\n- Provides search (at least it is suppose to)\n- Allows versioning of docs\n- Hosts documentation for free\n### Known Issues\n- The styling with MkDocs + ReadTheDocs isn't great, places with inline code blocks rended in a weird way\n  - I tried fixing this but I'm not well versed in CSS, so if someone wants to take a crack at it feel free\n- https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/2025 - When MkDocs is deployed on ReadTheDocs, search is broken\n- https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/834 - MkDocs has some issues with rendering long code blocks in HTML tables, a workaround has been put into place (manually splitting long code blocks)\n- https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/374 - MkDocs doesn't support PDF generation\n- https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1939 - MkDocs on ReadTheDocs doesn't support exporting HTML\n- https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/803 - ReadTheDocs Table of Contents doesn't stay anchored\n- rtfd/readthedocs.org#1917 - ReadTheDocs contains a footer pointing to the GitHub repo - these links are currently broken\n- mkdocs/mkdocs#269 - The \"Edit on GitHub\" links on each page are sub-par\n### Alternatives\n- There are a number of issues with MkDocs + ReadTheDocs, the integration is not fully there and even the commiters on ReadTheDocs admit the integration has problems; ReadTheDocs seems to primarily support usage with Sphinx\n  - The problem with Sphinx is that it works with `rst` files instead of `md` files - RST is a different markup language primarily created for writing Python documentation\n- Sphinx does have integration with [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/) which is an attempt to create a standardized Markdown spec, but even that has its issues - for example, CommonMark does not support table creation yet (outside of manually creating the HTML)\n  - ReadTheDocs seems to officially support CommonMark: http://blog.readthedocs.com/adding-markdown-support/ - if someone wants to play around with replacing MkDocs with Commonmark + Sphinx feel free\n- MkDocs has some integration with GitHub Pages, but it is not based on Jekyll so we would have to scrap our current Github Page\n- Native Github-Pages doesn't have support for search, and all documentation has to be in a separate branch - it also doesn't support nice features like automatically created Table of

Changes\n- Added `StoreDeployer` which copies config files in classpath to a `ConfigStore`\n- Added a new interface called `Deployable` which has a `deploy()` and a `rollback()` method. A `ConfigStore` can implement a `Deployable`. The `StoreDeployer` initializes the right `deployable` `ConfigStore` using the `storeUri`. \n- The actual configs should be in its own package/project and in the classpath. This project will add gobblin-confg-management as a dependency. On calling `StoreDeployer.deploy()`, the configs in classpath are deployed\n- Rollback is not yet implemented\n## Example\n\nIf \"test-root\" is a resource in classpath and all resources (config

PR enables Hive registration to support both MetaStoreClient-based registration and query-based registration (originally it only supports the former). \n\nMain changes:\n- `HiveRegister` is now an abstract class. It can be implemented by `HiveMetaStoreBasedRegister` (which is similar as the original `HiveRegister` class), and `HiveQueryBasedRegister` (not in this PR).\n- To remove dependency on Hive's `Table` and `Partition` classes, I created a `HiveTable` class and a `HivePartition` class in Gobblin, both of which extends `HiveRegistrationUnit`. Hive's `Table`/`Partition` can be converted to Gobblin's `HiveTable`/`HivePartition` (and vice versa) in `HiveMetaStoreUtils`.\n- Removed `HiveStorageDescriptorManager`, since storage descriptors are now created in `HiveMetaStoreUtils` in the process of converting `HiveTable`/`HivePartition` to `Table`/`Partition`. `HiveSchemaManager` is renamed to `HiveSerDeManager`.\n\nNow the only classes that depend on `hive-metastore` are `HiveMetaStoreBasedRegister` and

@sahilTakiar Can you review?\n### Usage\n\nThis allows the user of gobblin to specify JVM arguments to the app_master and containers and have gobblin automatically pick ports where needed.  This is done by detecting a specific token within the jvm argument string.  This token is in any of the following forms:\n1. `${PORT_1234}` : Try to get port 1234 and fail if it is not available\n2. `${PORT_1234+}`: Try to get any port from the specified port inclusive to the maximum port (65535) inclusive\n3. `${PORT_?}`: Try to get a random port between the minimum port (1025) inclusive and the maximum port (65535) inclusive\n\nGobblin will attempt to pick the specified port, but if it is not available Gobblin will successively try each high port until an open one is found. The actual JVM argument script will be logged as the first log line of the app_master and containers.\n### Example\n\n```\ngobblin.yarn.app.master.jvm.args=\"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=${PORT_5005+}\"\n```\n","created_at":"2016-02-24T05:27:48Z","updated_at":"2017-01-27T18:07:22Z","closed_at":"2017-01-27T10:04:13Z","merged_at":"2017-01-27T10:04:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"d758089350396c2564ccc7392341a61d5401281e","assignee":{"login":"kadaan","id":1904898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan","html_url":"https://github.com/kadaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"kadaan","id":1904898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan","html_url":"https://github.com/kadaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"htran1","id":23297947,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMjk3OTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23297947?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1","html_url":"https://github.com/htran1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/htran1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":153127084,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTMxMjcwODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null},{"id":337979564,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc5Nzk1NjQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/labels/LaunchType:Yarn","name":"LaunchType:Yarn","color":"bfe5bf","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/752/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/752/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/752/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8fc92f1930d706da1b1d3e04fb97f3b0278155a4","head":{"label":"kadaan:AllowPortAssigning","ref":"AllowPortAssigning","sha":"8fc92f1930d706da1b1d3e04fb97f3b0278155a4","user":{"login":"kadaan","id":1904898,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDQ4OTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1904898?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan","html_url":"https://github.com/kadaan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kadaan/received_eve

the `HiveSpec` interface had `getDbName()`, `getTableName()` and `getSd()`, so one can specify sd-related properties in the sd, but it was not possible to specify table properties that are not in the sd, such as retention, privilege, table type, etc.\n\nThe new `HiveSpec` interface has a `getTable()` method that returns a `Table` object containing all these properties. \n\nAlso, `HiveRegistrationPolicy` interface is modified to return a collection of `HiveSpec`s, rather than a single `HiveSpec`, because a path may correspond to zero or multiple `HiveSpec`s.\n","created_at":"2016-02-16T22:13:37Z","updated_at":"2016-02-18T18:07:42Z","closed_at":"2016-02-18T18:07:33Z","merged_at":"2016-02-18T18:07:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff646639fecf67105dbcc506596130b2352114d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0f0c81eb7dd67c927f6585b77fcdf1c44080ecb5","head":{"label":"zliu41:hive3","ref":"hive3","sha":"0f0c81eb7dd67c927f6585b77fcdf1c44080ecb5","user":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32048123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjA0ODEyMw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"zliu41/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobb

bug reported in https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/issues/702\n- The `JobLauncherUtils.fileToProperties` method takes a path to a props file and reads it using a `FileSystem` object\n- The `FileSystem` object is created by invoking `path.getFileSystem(Configuration)`\n- It seems that if the `path` has no scheme + authority the default `FileSystem` is used\n- The default fs when running locally is the local fs, the default fs when running on a cluster is the HDFS fs\n- This can be confusing as the script expects the config file to be in different filesystems depending on where things are run\n- Behavior is changed so if no scheme + authority is specified the local fs is used by default, if users expect the files to be on HDFS then they should set the scheme to `hdfs`\n  *\\* This should be much more intuitive as most of the time props files will be on the local fs, not on HDFS\n\n@zliu41 can you

Changes:\n1. Switched database scripts to use [flyway](https://flywaydb.org).  This enables us to keep track of migration scripts, ensure that users can upgrade, and verify that the correct version is installed.\n2. Changed tests from using derby to using embedded mysql.  This allows our tests to verify the same code, migrations, etc. as will be used in production.\n3. Added a check in `DatabaseJobHistoryStore` that verifies that the DB is the correct version.  If it is not, a warning will be logged and all operations on the store will become no-ops. This ensures that we don't break if users upgrade the code, but forget to upgrade the database.\n4. Changed travis build to have dependencies needed to run embedded mysql, split the jdk7/jdk8 build jobs, enabled caching.  This allows easier identification of problems, improves performance, etc.\n5. Changed `DatabaseJobHistoryStore` to use batching and upserts to greatly increase performance.  Also stopped sending in epoch for startTime/endTime which are not specified.  Lastly, removed job properties from task properties to reduce data suplication.  All this is to improve performance and data correctness.\n6. Changed the admin UI to show '-' for startTime/endTime when not set\n7. Added step at end of travis build to output test failures to console.  The facilitates the ability to determine why the build failed.\n8. Enabled support for compression in the JobExecutionInfoServer\n9. Reduced the amount of data requested by Admin UI\n10. Rewrote the `DatabaseJobHistoryStore` querying code to greatly reduce the number of queries\n# Job History Store Management\n\n**Migrate an unmanaged database (First Time)**\n\n```

PR changes work unit generation in `CopySource`:\n- Enable parallelization: each dataset will be handled by a separate thread.\n- Sets `CopySource` to allow for work unit limit and dataset / partition priorities in the future.\n\n`ConcurrentBoundedWorkUnitList` is the core of these features: it is a concurrent, bounded, prioritized list of work units. Attempting to insert a file set when it doesn't fit will evict strictly lower priority file sets if and only if doing so would allow the higher priority file set to fit in the list. All file sets (groups of `WorkUnit`) are handled as a unit, so each file set is either completely evicted or retained.\n","created_at":"2016-02-04T20:49:36Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T19:26:25Z","closed_at":"2016-02-09T19:26:24Z","merged_at":"2016-02-09T19:26:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"f35b7d1b358122c7953b63ec7b252a597bace2fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/669/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/669/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/669/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8192b27061d5da675cbcb4c5daf3929f5019589a","head":{"label":"ibuenros:parallelize-copy-listing","ref":"parallelize-copy-listing","sha":"8192b27061d5da675cbcb4c5daf3929f5019589a","user":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33570608,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3MDYwOA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"ibuenros/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ibuenros","id":1364112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjQxMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1364112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros","html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ibuenros/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ibuenros/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ibuenros/gobblin/contents/{+path

for https://github.com/linkedin/gobblin/issues/561\n- This should ensure that for a given `WorkUnitState` its data has been committed before the `WorkUnitState.WorkingState` is set to `COMMITTED`.\n- The solution is a bit of hack because the code will now commit data for all `WorkUnitState`s first and then it will set the `WorkingState` of each `WorkUnitState` to `COMMITTED`\n  - This is better

is the initial commit for Hive registration. It mainly contains interfaces, abstract classes, base implementations, as well as the main class `HiveRegister`.\n- `HiveRegister` performs Hive registration given a `HiveSpec`, which specifies which path, which db, which table, etc., to register.  There are several extensions to `HiveSpec`, including `HiveSpecWithPredicates`, `HiveSpecWithPreActivities` and `HiveSpecWithPostActivities`. A base implementation `SimpleHiveSpec` is included.\n- A `HiveSpec` is generated by a `HiveRegistrationPolicy` given a `Path`. A base implementation `HiveRegistrationPolicyBase` is included.\n- To do Hive registration, a `StorageDescriptor` and some schema properties are often required. These are managed by `HiveStorageDescriptorManager` and `HiveSchemaManager`.\n","created_at":"2016-02-01T21:16:39Z","updated_at":"2016-02-09T20:19:36Z","closed_at":"2016-02-09T20:19:31Z","merged_at":"2016-02-09T20:19:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"f83a2827c7c12955ea97fe4b096a8d8b18b0980a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/651/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/651/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/651/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/d73ad624aac0fb7e51c62bcbd47c565d7669a673","head":{"label":"zliu41:hive","ref":"hive","sha":"d73ad624aac0fb7e51c62bcbd47c565d7669a673","user":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32048123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjA0ODEyMw==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"zliu41/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zliu41","id":6342538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNDI1Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6342538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41","html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zliu41/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zliu41/gobblin","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu41/gobblin/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zliu4
