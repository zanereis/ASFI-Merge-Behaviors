intention of the `CompletableApplicationEvent` is for a `Consumer` to enqueue the event and then block, waiting for it to complete. The application thread will block up to the amount of the timeout. This change introduces a consistent manner in which events are expired out by checking their timeout values.\r\n\r\nThe `CompletableEventReaper` is a new class that tracks `CompletableEvent`s that are enqueued. Both the application thread and the network I/O thread maintain their own reaper instances. The application thread will track any `CompletableBackgroundEvent`s that it receives and the network I/O thread will do the same with any `CompletableApplicationEvent`s it receives. The application and network I/O threads will check their tracked events, and if any are expired, the reaper will invoke each event's `CompletableFuture.completeExceptionally()` method with a `TimeoutException`.\r\n\r\nOn closing the `AsyncKafkaConsumer`, both threads will invoke their respective reapers to cancel any unprocessed events in their queues. In this case, the reaper will invoke each event's `CompletableFuture.completeExceptionally()` method with a `CancellationException` instead of a `TimeoutException` to differentiate the two cases.\r\n\r\nThe overall design for the expiration mechanism is captured on the [Apache wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Java+client+Consumer+timeouts) and the original issue (KAFKA-15848) has more background on the cause.\r\n\r\nNote: this change only handles the _event_ expiration and does _not_ cover the network request expiration. That is handled in a follow-up Jira (KAFKA-16200) that builds atop this change.\r\n\r\nThis change also includes some minor refactoring of the `EventProcessor` and its implementations. This allows the event processor logic to focus on processing _individual_ events rather than also the handling of _batches_ of events.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-01T21:43:52Z","updated_at":"2024-05-22T16:54:18Z","closed_at":"2024-05-22T16:11:10Z","merged_at":"2024-05-22T16:11:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"a98c9be6b00806c870c542c2a6ecbd247e2bf712","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/91af164415b8b950c70d3a61bb0837c34ae4ed69","head":{"label":"kirktrue:KAFKA-15974-enforce-timeout-in-events","ref":"KAFKA-15974-enforce-timeout-in-events","sha":"91af164415b8b950c70d3a61bb0837c34ae4ed69","user":{"login":"kirktrue","id":92057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue","html_url":"https://github.com/kirktrue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":709917636,"node_id":"R_kgDOKlB7xA","name":"kafka","full_name":"kirktrue/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kirktrue","id":92057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyMDU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue","html_url":"https://github.com/kirktrue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kirktrue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kirktrue/kafka","description":"Mirror

seems to me the root cause is `LogDirFailureHandler#testIOExceptionDuringLogRoll` does not clean `directoryIds` in holding `replicaStateChangeLock`, and hence metadata event thread can see the intermediate state of failure handle and then assume the deleted folder is online (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/cluster/Partition.scala#L877)\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  private def createLogInAssignedDirectoryId(partitionState: LeaderAndIsrPartitionState, highWatermarkCheckpoints: OffsetCheckpoints, topicId: Option[Uuid], targetLogDirectoryId: Option[Uuid]): Unit = {\r\n    targetLogDirectoryId match {\r\n      case Some(directoryId) =>\r\n        // [CHIA] logManager.onlineLogDirId(directoryId) return true\r\n        // there are two results:\r\n        // 1) KafkaStorageException is thrown by `LogManager.getOrCreateLog`\r\n        // 2) log is hosted by another directory (id) rather than targetLogDirectoryId\r\n          if (logManager.onlineLogDirId(directoryId) || !logManager.hasOfflineLogDirs() || directoryId == DirectoryId.UNASSIGNED) {\r\n          createLogIfNotExists(partitionState.isNew, isFutureReplica = false, highWatermarkCheckpoints, topicId, targetLogDirectoryId)\r\n        } else {\r\n          warn(s\"Skipping creation of log because there are potentially offline log \" +\r\n            s\"directories and log may already exist there. directoryId=$directoryId, \" +\r\n            s\"topicId=$topicId, targetLogDirectoryId=$targetLogDirectoryId\")\r\n        }\r\n\r\n      case None =>\r\n        createLogIfNotExists(partitionState.isNew, isFutureReplica = false, highWatermarkCheckpoints, topicId)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence, there are two options to stabilize the `testIOExceptionDuringLogRoll`\r\n\r\n1. call `logManager.handleLogDirFailure(dir)` in holding `replicaStateChangeLock` (https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ReplicaManager.scala#L2473) to avoid race condition.\r\n\r\n2. change the assert to allow both empty folder and the folder which having different directory (id). https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/test/scala/unit/kafka/utils/TestUtils.scala#L1715\r\n\r\nBTW, the option 2 means we allow to using other directory to replace `targetLogDirectoryId` when creating log. That violates the comment: \"@param targetLogDirectoryId The directory Id that should host the the partition's topic.\"

If the high watermark is less than the local-log-start-offset, then the UnifiedLog#fetchHighWatermarkMetadata method will throw  OFFSET_OUT_OF_RANGE error when it converts the offset to metadata. Once this error happens, the followers will receive out-of-range exceptions and the producers won't be able to produce messages since the leader cannot move the high watermark.\r\n\r\nThis issue can happen when the partition undergoes recovery due to corruption in the checkpoint file and it gets elected as leader before it gets a chance to update the HW from the previous leader.\r\n\r\nThe follower sends the first FETCH request to the leader, the leader checks whether the isFollowerInSync, then expands the ISR.

consumer will receive 'OutOfRangeException' in the following case:\r\n\r\nIn a specific concurrent scenario, imagine sequential offsets: offset1 < offset2 < offset3. A client requests data at offset2. While a background deletion process removes segments from memory, it hasn't yet updated the LocalLogStartOffset from offset1 to offset3. Consequently, when the fetch offset (offset2) is evaluated against the stale offset1 in ReplicaManager.handleOffsetOutOfRangeError, it incorrectly triggers an OffsetOutOfRangeException. This issue arises from the out-of-sync update of localLogStartOffset, leading to incorrect handling of consumer fetch requests and potential data access errors.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the example scenario from the JIRA [comment](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16073?focusedCommentId=17801663&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-17801663)\r\n\r\nLet us assume each segment has one offset in this example:\r\nlog start offset 0\r\nlog end offset 10\r\nlocal log start offset 4\r\nfetch offset 6\r\nnew local log start offset 7\r\n\r\nDeletion based on retention configs is started and eventually updating the local log start offset as 7.\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition here where the segments list is updated by removing 4, 5, and 6 offset segments in LocalLog and then updates the local-log-start-offset. But fetch offset is being served concurrently and it may throw OffsetOutOfRangeException if the inmemory segments are already removed in LocalLog and local-log-start-offset is not yet updated as 7 when it executes the [code](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ReplicaManager.scala#L1866) as it fails the condition because fetch offset(6) < old

are times when the controller has a high event processing time such as during startup or when creating a topic with many partitions. We can see these processing times in the p99 metric (kafka.controller:type=ControllerEventManager,name=EventQueueProcessingTimeMs), however it's difficult to see exactly which event is causing high processing time.\r\n\r\nWith DEBUG logs, we see every event along with its processing time. Even with this, it's a bit tedious to find the event with a high processing time.\r\n\r\nThis PR logs all events which take longer than 2 seconds at ERROR level. This will help identify events that are taking far too long, and which could be disruptive to the operation of the controller.

object, and has to dispatch to one of four serializers depending on it's type which is currently done by taking the class name of the RemoteLogMetadata and looking it up in maps to find the corresponding serializer for that class. This later requires an unchecked cast, because the RemoteLogMetadataTransform is generic. This is replaced by if-elseif-else statements which are type-safe.

Problem\r\nIt is not ~possible~ easy to add a custom `ReplicaManager` to a class extending `BrokerServer`.  \r\n\r\nLet's say I create a new `ReplicaManager` in a class inheriting from `BrokerServer` with the same variables and override the method [replicaManager](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/BrokerServer.scala#L170) to return that instead. \r\n\r\nThis leads to a null pointer exception in [ReplicaManager](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ReplicaManager.scala#L304), as `quotaManagers` is only initialised in the [startup](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/BrokerServer.scala#L190) method.\r\n\r\nWell, not the end of the world. I can set the new `ReplicaManager` to null and use lazy loading, ensuring that the new `ReplicaManager` is only created after `quotaManagers` is instantiated.\r\n\r\nNow we face a new exception:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: A metric named 'MetricName [name=connection-count, group=AddPartitionsManager-channel-metrics, description=The current number of active connections., tags={}]' already exists, can't register another one.\r\n```\r\nWe try to register our metrics more than once, one time in the [BrokerServer](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/BrokerServer.scala#L274) and another in our class inheriting from `BrokerServer`. This happens because `addPartitionsToTxnManager` is in the scope of the `startup` method.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I can't think of any elegant solution to this problem without changing open-source, and neither like the fact I need to use lazy loading in order to create a variable.\r\n\r\nSide note: `ReplicaManager`'s constructor takes `quotaManagers` as an argument, which is both a method in [KafkaBroker](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaBroker.scala#L87), and a variable in [BrokerServer](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/BrokerServer.scala#L133). This looks like an anti-pattern.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Why is this not a problem for `KafkaServer`?\r\n[KafkaServer](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaServer.scala#L693) has a `createReplicaManager` method that defines how the `ReplicaManager` is created. This method is only called after `quotaManagers` has been instantiated, removing need to lazy load in inherited class, and also creates `addPartitionsToTxnManager`, ensuring we don't register metrics twice when overriding.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Proposed solution\r\n1. Replicate the [createReplicaManager](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/KafkaServer.scala#L693) pattern for `BrokerServer` so that we can override that method, rather than overriding the `replicaManager` method defined in the `KafkaBroker`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-28T14:25:16Z","updated_at":"2024-12-18T11:09:45Z","closed_at":"2024-08-15T09:51:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9e9cbb59a3245c25617fb2391a2b0f7e2f145c8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15617/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15617/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15617/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/a25abe983eec1ef1b9ff14a15877854d7650f223","head":{"label":"FilipePintoReis:minor-extract-replica-manager-broker-server","ref":"minor-extract-replica-manager-broker-server","sha":"a25abe983eec1ef1b9ff14a15877854d7650f223","user":{"login":"FilipePintoReis","id":25771637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzcxNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25771637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis","html_url":"https://github.com/FilipePintoReis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":778831939,"node_id":"R_kgDOLmwIQw","name":"kafka","full_name":"FilipePintoReis/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"FilipePintoReis","id":25771637,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1NzcxNjM3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25771637?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis","html_url":"https://github.com/FilipePintoReis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FilipePintoReis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/FilipePintoReis/kafka","description":"Mirror

javadoc for `KafkaConsumer.commitSync` says:\r\n\r\n> Note that asynchronous offset commits sent previously with the {@link #commitAsync(OffsetCommitCallback)}\r\n> (or similar) are guaranteed to have their callbacks invoked prior to completion of this method.\r\n\r\nThis is not always true in the async consumer, where there is no code at all to make sure that the callback is executed before commitSync returns.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the async consumer is also missing logic to await callback execution in `close`. While the javadoc doesn't explicitly promise callback execution, it promises \"completing commits\", which one would reasonably expect to include callback execution. Also, the legacy consumer contains some code to execute callbacks before closing.\r\n\r\nThis change proposed a number of fixes to clean up the callback execution guarantees in the async consumer:\r\n\r\n  - We keep track of the incomplete async commit\r\n    futures and wait for them to complete before returning from \r\n    `commitSync` or `close` (if there is time).\r\n  - Since we need to block to make sure that our previous commits are \r\n    completed, we allow the consumer to wake up. \r\n\r\nSome similar gaps are addressed in the legacy consumer, see https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15693\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nTwo new integration tests and a couple of unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-27T15:51:55Z","updated_at":"2024-04-22T11:26:16Z","closed_at":"2024-04-22T11:26:15Z","merged_at":"2024-04-22T11:26:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"ed47e37b28341a181b0114827e1b5474bcc368c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

directory\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"version\":1,\r\n    \"partitions\":[\r\n        { \"topic\":\"t3\",\"partition\":0,\"replicas\":[1],\"log_dirs\":[\"/var/lib/kafka/data/logs\"] },\r\n        { \"topic\":\"t3\",\"partition\":1,\"replicas\":[1, 2, 3],\"log_dirs\":[\"/var/lib/kafka/data/logs\", \"/var/lib/kafka/data/logs2\", \"/var/lib/kafka/data/logs2\"] }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- origin output\r\n```\r\nSuccessfully started partition reassignments for t3-0,t3-1\r\nSuccessfully started log directory moves for: t3-0-1,t3-1-1,t3-1-2,t3-1-3\r\n```\r\n- proposed output\r\n```\r\nSuccessfully started partition reassignments for t3-0,t3-1\r\nSuccessfully started moving log directory to /var/lib/kafka/data/logs for replica t3-0 with broker id: 1\r\nSuccessfully started moving log directory to /var/lib/kafka/data/logs for replica t3-1 with broker id: 1\r\nSuccessfully started moving log directory to /var/lib/kafka/data/logs2 for replica t3-1 with broker id: 2\r\nSuccessfully started moving log directory to /var/lib/kafka/data/logs2 for replica t3-1 with broker id: 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

was flaky as the wanted error either affected the next block request (prefecthing) or just missed that.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst I tried to wait for the background thread to be finished before setting the Errors.X. But then it consistently failed, because the generateProducerId call does prefetching too and after a successful producer id generation we set the error and expected that it will fail again with coordinator-load-in-progress exception but since the block was prefetched, it was able to serve us with a proper producer id. \r\n\r\n1) calling generateProducerId --> no current block exists, so requesting block --> CoordinatorLoadInProgressException\r\nasserting exception\r\n2) calling generateProducerId again --> prefetching, requesting the next block --> giving back the producer id from the first block\r\nasserting received producer id\r\nsetting error -- waiting for the background callback(s) to be finished first\r\n3) calling generateProducerId, expecting CoordinatorLoadInProgressException, but --> works like 2), just the prefetching callback is failing due to the error we set before\r\n\r\nNote: without the waiting for the background thread completions the error setting could happened before the 2) step's callback or after that, the test was written in a way that it expected to happen before the cb. \r\n\r\nThis was the point I realised that we need to have a queue to control the responses rather than trying to do it in the middle of the test method.\r\n\r\nErrors can be passed in a queue at creation of the mock id manager instead modifying on-the-fly.\r\nIn the queue we're specifying Errors, how the background thread (which imitates the controllerChannel) should behave, return an error or a proper response and call the callback accordingly with that.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was able to simplify the mock manager id class as well, no need for the maybeRequestNextBlock overriding if the errors are handled this way via a queue.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

adds a thread-safe alternative to the current Exit implementation, which doesn't make use of static mutable fields. This solves a number of problems:\r\n\r\n1. Thread isolation: Two tests can inject exit procedures concurrently, without conflicting with one-another\r\n2. The test-only methods for manipulating the state of Exit are present on the main class, and so could be called in a non-test environment.\r\n3. When fatal procedures are not intercepted by Exit, shutdown hooks are delayed until the real JVM exit, possibly leaking resources/files across tests.\r\n4. When fatal procedures are intercepted by Exit, those exceptions can go un-noticed, and may not cause the test to fail.\r\n5. When shutdown hooks are intercepted by Exit, they are dropped and never executed\r\n6. It isn't clear to code calling exit() that an exception might be thrown instead when the procedures are mocked. \r\n\r\nThe Java and Scala Exit classes don't use any instance methods, so I was able to directly add instance methods to the existing classes. This should prevent the need for a large rename later, such as appears necessary with the other options I could think of:\r\n\r\n* Add it as a different class SafeExit: large amount of code churn when Exit is removed, silly name\r\n* Moving \"Exit\" to \"UnsafeExit\" now: large amount of code churn up-front, immediate merge conflicts\r\n* Add it to a different package as \"utils.temp.Exit\": moderate amount of code churn when Exit is removed, harder to review\r\n\r\nBecause static and instance methods cannot share signatures, I had to perturb the names slightly. I think the new names are acceptable, and shouldn't cause any additional code churn.\r\n* exit to exitOrThrow\r\n* halt to haltOrThrow\r\n* addShutdownHook to addShutdownRunnable\r\n\r\nIn the interest of not testing tests, I've omitted tests for these changes. The existing ExitTest is testing the mocking methods, which are not part of the main API now, just the MockExit API.\r\n\r\nI imagine that this will be rolled out in stages:\r\n\r\n1. Replace Exit.exit() calls (and similar) in Kafka with Exit.staticContext().exitOrThrow().\r\n2. Move the Exit.staticContext() calls upward in the call graph to evaluate the staticContext() as soon as possible, and ensure that objects use consistent exit procedures\r\n3. Replace Exit.setExitProcedure in Kafka tests with MockExit\r\n4. Deprecate thread-unsafe Exit procedures as a signal to the community\r\n5. Remove thread-unsafe Exit procedures, replacing Exit.staticContext() with Exit.system()\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-25T18:26:47Z","updated_at":"2025-02-05T03:36:06Z","closed_at":"2025-02-05T03:36:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc0ebdcbfa0738c417e4989be1272c5577d73bca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

of the changes:\r\n\r\n1. Parameterizes the tests to use new coordinator and pass in consumer group protocol. This would be applicable to sink connectors only.\r\n2. Enhances the sink connector creation code in system tests to accept a new optional parameter for consumer group protocol to be used.\r\n3. Sets the consumer group protocol via `consumer.override.` override config when the new group coordinator is enabled.\r\n\r\nNote about testing: There are 288 tests that need to be run and running on my local takes a lot of time.

KIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-339%3A+Create+a+new+IncrementalAlterConfigs+API) `incrementalAlterConfigs API` was introduced to change any config dynamically since the existing `alterConfig API` replaces any existing configuration with new configuration. This makes AlterConfigs unusable in cases where the client does not know the full existing configuration before making the modification. Even worse, in some cases, the client may be unable to discover the existing configuration.  \"Sensitive\" fields are not returned by DescribeConfigs. `kakfa-config.sh (CommandConfig)` still uses `alterConfig` to update the config.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nUpdated existing test that will cover the

implementing the group type conversion from a classic group to a consumer group, if the replay of conversion records fails, the group should be reverted back including its timeouts. \r\n\r\nA possible solution is to keep all the classic group timeouts and add a type check to the timeout operations. If the group is successfully upgraded, it won't be able to pass the type check and its operations will be executed without actually doing anything; if the group upgrade fails, the group map will be reverted and the timeout operations will be executed as is.\r\n\r\nWe've already have group type check in consumer group timeout operations. This pr adds similar type check to those classic group timeout operations.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

fixed a bug whereby we didn't undo the name mangling used on client quota entity names stored in ZooKeeper. However, it incorrectly claimed to fix the handling of default client quota entities. It also failed to correctly re-mangle when syncronizing the data back to ZooKeeper.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes ZkConfigMigrationClient to do the mangling correctly on both the read and write paths. We do unmangling before invoking the visitors, since after all it does not make sense to do the same unmangling step in each and every visitor.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR fixes a bug causing default entities to be converted incorrectly. For example, ClientQuotaEntity(user -> null) is stored under the /config/users/<default> znode in ZooKeeper. In KRaft it appears as a ClientQuotaRecord with EntityData(entityType=users, entityName=null). Prior to this PR, this was being converted to a ClientQuotaRecord with EntityData(entityType=users, entityName=\"\"). That represents a quota on the user whose name is the empty string (yes, we allow users to name themselves with the empty string, sadly.)\r\n\r\nThe confusion appears to have arisen because for TOPIC and BROKER configurations, the default ConfigResource is indeed the one named with the empty (not null) string. For example, the default topic configuration resource is ConfigResource(name=\"\", type=TOPIC).  However, things are different for client quotas. Default client quota entities in KRaft (and also in AdminClient) are represented by maps with null values. For example, the default User entity is represented by Map(\"user\" -> null).  In retrospect, using a map with null values was a poor choice; a Map<String, Optional<String>> would have made more sense. However, this is the way the API currently is and we have to convert correctly.\r\n\r\nThere was an additional level of confusion present in KAFKA-16222 where someone thought that using the ZooKeeper placeholder string \"<default>\" in the AdminClient API would yield a default client quota entity. Thise seems to have been perpetuated by the ConfigEntityName class that was created recently. In fact, <default> is not part of any public API in Kafka. Accordingly, this PR also renames ConfigEntityName.DEFAULT to ZooKeeperInternals.DEFAULT_STRING, to make it clear that the string <default> is just a detail of the ZooKeeper implementation.  It is not used in the Kafka API to indicate defaults. Hopefully this will avoid confusion in the future.\r\n\r\nFinally, the PR also creates KRaftClusterTest.testDefaultClientQuotas to get extra test coverage of setting default client quotas.","created_at":"2024-03-22T23:50:06Z","updated_at":"2024-03-26T23:49:42Z","closed_at":"2024-03-26T23:49:39Z","merged_at":"2024-03-26T23:49:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"8d914b543d5d23031fe178d424f45789eaa8d1fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/3e52dcb560a6a945d6a972a19f31d1c7de88037a","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-16411","ref":"KAFKA-16411","sha":"3e52dcb560a6a945d6a972a19f31d1c7de88037a","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

PR includes a fix to properly identify a reconciliation that should be interrupted and not applied because the member has rejoined. It does so simply based on a flag (not epochs, server or local). If the member has rejoined while reconciling, the reconciliation will be interrupted. \r\n\r\nThis also ensures that the check to abort the reconciliation is performed on all the 3 stages of the reconciliation that could be delayed: commit, onPartitionsRevoked, onPartitionsAssigned.

is minor changes!\r\n\r\n- Jira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15951\r\n- `MissingSourceTopicException` has field `missingTopics` to store missing topics. \r\n- The `StreamsPartitionAssignor` throws a `MissingSourceTopicException`. and it depends on result of `repartitionTopics.missingSourceTopicExceptions().isEmpty()`. thus, `missingSourceTopicExceptions()` must always contain an iterable `MissingSourceTopicException`, allowing for the aggregation and throwing of `MissingSourceTopics`.\r\n- Idea for improving more\r\n  -  `StreamsRebalanceListener` can throw `MissingSourceTopicException` as well. however, `StreamsRebalanceListener` cannot get missing topic List because `StreamsRebalanceListener` depends on ErrorCode `AssignorError.INCOMPLETE_SOURCE_TOPIC_METADATA.code()`\r\n  - If `StreamsRebalanceListener` should include missing topic list when it throws `MissingSourceTopicException` as well, we can consider `ThreadLocal` to reach the target. \r\n  - Skeleton\r\n    -  Set `ThreadLocal` to `StreamThread` as member field.\r\n    -  Put missing topics to `ThreadLocal`. \r\n    - `StreamsRebalanceListener`

What\r\nOn a client-side triggered request timeout (the client did not receive a response from the server in a timely manner), the client needs to refresh metadata. This requires the partition response passed to `completeBatch` to be an `instanceof InvalidMetadataException`.\r\nThis is slightly different than Errors.REQUEST_TIMED_OUT, since the latter is returned when the HWM fails to advance within the configured request timeout threshold, so we do not want to make `REQUEST_TIMED_OUT` an invalid metadata exception.\r\n\r\nI couldn't find a better fit than NETWORK_EXCEPTION, so hopefully the improved logging from KAFKA-14317 still reasonably distinguishes between request timeouts and sudden connection interrupts.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAdded a unit test

the initial EOS example, a retry logic was implemented within the `resetToLastCommittedPositions` method. During refactoring, this logic was removed becasue a poison pill prevented the example from reaching the final phase of consuming from the output topic.\r\n\r\nIn this change, I suggest to add it back, but with a retry limit defined as `MAX_RETRIES`. Once this limit is reached, the problematic batch will be logged and skipped, allowing the processor to move on and process remaining records. If some records are skipped, the example will still hit the hard timeout (2 minutes), but after consuming all processed records.\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-20T11:34:14Z","updated_at":"2024-04-08T03:23:32Z","closed_at":"2024-03-27T08:31:27Z","merged_at":"2024-03-27T08:31:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"4cb20379c7abc07bb18075674553abc11954f286","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"divijvaidya","id":71267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya","html_url":"https://github.com/divijvaidya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/divijvaidya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/a2971704397e0b7f4b1fa78dafce2b70933c9afb","head":{"label":"fvaleri:eos-example-retry","ref":"eos-example-retry","sha":"a2971704397e0b7f4b1fa78dafce2b70933c9afb","user":{"login":"fvaleri","id":11456498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDU2NDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11456498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri","html_url":"https://github.com/fvaleri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":320900774,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjA5MDA3NzQ=","name":"kafka","full_name":"fvaleri/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fvaleri","id":11456498,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDU2NDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11456498?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri","html_url":"https://github.com/fvaleri","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fvaleri/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fvaleri/kafka","description":"Mirror

Part 1 introduced verification of transactions with the transaction coordinator on the `Produce` and `TxnOffsetCommit` paths. This introduced the possibility of new errors when responding to those requests. For backwards compatibility with older clients, a choice was made to convert some of the new retriable errors to existing errors that are expected and retried correctly by older clients.\r\n\r\n`NETWORK_EXCEPTION` was forgotten about and not converted, but can occur if, for example, the transaction coordinator is temporarily refusing connections. Now, we convert it to:\r\n * `NOT_ENOUGH_REPLICAS` on the `Produce` path, just like the other retriable errors that can arise from transaction verification.\r\n * `COORDINATOR_LOAD_IN_PROGRESS` on the `TxnOffsetCommit` path. This error does not force coordinator lookup on clients, unlike `COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE`. Note that this deviates from KIP-890, which says that retriable errors should be converted to `COORDINATOR_NOT_AVAILABLE`.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/15364, we introduced, thoughtfully, a non-backward compatible record change for the new consumer group protocol. So it is a good opportunity for cleaning unused fields, mainly related to the client side assignor logic which is not implemented yet. It is better to introduce them when we need them and more importantly when we implement it.\r\n\r\nNote that starting from 3.8, we won't make such changes anymore. Non-backward compatible changes are still acceptable now because we clearly said that upgrade won't be supported from the KIP-848 EA.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n-

 This pr is aims to fix the wrong highWatermark assert equals condition in `HighwatermarkPersistenceTest`.  The highWatermark need lower than LEO, but in `HighwatermarkPersistenceTest#testHighWatermarkPersistenceSinglePartition`, the test not append only data to partition, so `updateHighWatermark()` cannot work, the `hw` are always 0.\r\n\r\nHowever, the test don't failed before because of the assert equals condition is self judgement which will be always true (equals to 0).\r\n \r\n\r\n### Committer
