Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n* Adding an additional check in `stringToTimestamp` to handle cases where the input has trailing ':'\r\n* Added a test to make sure this works.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn a couple of scenarios while converting from String to Timestamp `DateTimeUtils.stringToTimestamp` throws an array out of bounds exception if there is trailing  ':'. The behavior of this method requires it to return `None` in case the format of the string is incorrect. \r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test in the `DateTimeTestUtils` suite to test if my fix works.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-16T18:18:42Z","updated_at":"2019-10-19T03:01:15Z","closed_at":"2019-10-18T21:45:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"fe27630196d19a64a9cd56c25ee47be2a5cb9137","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26143/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26143/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26143/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5ef53b7ca639c0bff5db28b9d96ba810974b3207","head":{"label":"rahulsmahadev:SPARK-29494","ref":"SPARK-29494","sha":"5ef53b7ca639c0bff5db28b9d96ba810974b3207","user":{"login":"rahulsmahadev","id":51690557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjkwNTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51690557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev","html_url":"https://github.com/rahulsmahadev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":215602087,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTU2MDIwODc=","name":"spark","full_name":"rahulsmahadev/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rahulsmahadev","id":51690557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNjkwNTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51690557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev","html_url":"https://github.com/rahulsmahadev","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rahulsmahadev/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rahulsmahadev/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRun sql in spark thrift server, each session 's thrift server about method will be called in one thread, but when running query statement,  we have two mode:\r\n 1. sync\r\n 2. async\r\n https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5a482e72091c8db940408905e8c044f7f5d7814f/sql/hive-thriftserver/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/thriftserver/SparkExecuteStatementOperation.scala#L205-L238\r\n\r\nIn sync mode, we just submit query in current session's corresponding thread and wait Spark to running query and return result,  and the query method will always wait for query return.\r\nIn async mode, in SparkExecuteStatementOperation, we will submit query in a backend thread pool, and update operation state,  after submitted to backend thread poll, ExecuteStatement method will return a OperationHandle to client side, and client side will request operation status continuously. after backend thread running sql and return , it will update corresponding  operation status, when client got operation status is final status, it will got error or start fetching result of this operation.\r\n\r\nWhen we use pyhive connect to SparkThriftServer, it will run statement in sync mode.\r\nWhen we query data of hive table , it will check serde class in HiveTableScanExec#addColumnMetadataToConf\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/5a482e72091c8db940408905e8c044f7f5d7814f/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/execution/HiveTableScanExec.scala#L123\r\n\r\n```\r\n

SessionState.get();\r\n    if (state != null && state.getConf() != null) {\r\n      ClassLoader sessionCL = state.getConf().getClassLoader();\r\n      if (sessionCL != null) {\r\n        if

 }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nSince we run statement in sync mode, it will use HiveSession's SessionState,  and use it's conf's classLoader. then error happened.\r\n```\r\nCurrent operation state

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdded new expressions `MultiplyInterval` and `DivideInterval` to multiply/divide an interval by a numeric. Updated `TypeCoercion.DateTimeOperations` to turn the `Multiply`/`Divide` expressions of `CalendarIntervalType` and `NumericType` to `MultiplyInterval`/`DivideInterval`.\r\n\r\nTo support new operations, added new methods `multiply()` and `divide()` to `CalendarInterval`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL which supports multiplication and division of intervals by doubles:\r\n```sql\r\n# select interval '1 hour' / double precision '1.5';\r\n ?column?\r\n----------\r\n 00:40:00\r\n``` \r\n- To conform the SQL standard which defines those operations: `numeric * interval`, `interval * numeric` and `interval / numeric`. See [4.5.3  Operations involving datetimes and intervals](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt).\r\n- Improve Spark SQL UX and allow users to adjust interval columns. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select (timestamp'now' - timestamp'yesterday') * 1.3;\r\ninterval 2 days 10 hours 39 minutes 38 seconds 568 milliseconds 900 microseconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, previously the following query fails with the error:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select interval 1 hour 30 minutes * 1.5;\r\nError in query: cannot resolve '(interval 1 hours 30 minutes * 1.5BD)' due to data type mismatch: differing types in '(interval 1 hours 30 minutes * 1.5BD)' (interval and decimal(2,1)).; line 1 pos 7;\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select interval 1 hour 30 minutes * 1.5;\r\ninterval 2 hours 15 minutes\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests for the `multiply()` and `divide()` methods to `CalendarIntervalSuite.java`\r\n- New test suite `IntervalExpressionsSuite`\r\n- by tests for `Multiply` -> `MultiplyInterval` and `Divide` -> `DivideInterval` in `TypeCoercionSuite`\r\n- updated

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nPatches CVE's reported by the vulnerability scanner.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nRan `mvn clean install -DskipTests`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nchange PySpark ml ```Params._clear``` to ```Params.clear```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPySpark ML currently has a private _clear() method that will unset a param. This should be made public to match the Scala API and give users a way to unset a user supplied param. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd `AnalyzeTableStatement` and `AnalyzeColumnStatement`, and make ANALYZE TABLE go through the same catalog/table resolution framework of v2 commands.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's important to make all the commands have the same table resolution behavior, to avoid confusing end-users. e.g.\r\n```\r\nUSE my_catalog\r\nDESC t // success and describe the table t from my_catalog\r\nANALYZE TABLE t // report table not found as there is no table t in the session catalog\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes. When running ANALYZE TABLE, Spark fails the command if the current catalog is set to a v2 catalog, or the table name specified a v2 catalog.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nnew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nObservable metrics are named arbitrary aggregate functions that can be defined on a query (Dataframe). As soon as the execution of a Dataframe reaches a completion point (e.g. finishes batch query or reaches streaming epoch) a named event is emitted that contains the metrics for the data processed since the last completion point.\r\n\r\nA user can observe these metrics by attaching a listener to spark session, it depends on the execution mode which listener to attach:\r\n- Batch: `QueryExecutionListener`. This will be called when the query completes. A user can access the metrics by using the `QueryExecution.observedMetrics` map.\r\n- (Micro-batch) Streaming: `StreamingQueryListener`. This will be called when the streaming query completes an epoch. A user can access the metrics by using the `StreamingQueryProgress.observedMetrics` map. Please note that we currently do not support continuous execution streaming.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis enabled observable metrics.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. It adds the `observe` method to `Dataset`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added unit tests for the `CollectMetrics` logical node to the `AnalysisSuite`.\r\n- Added unit tests for `StreamingProgress` JSON serialization to the `StreamingQueryStatusAndProgressSuite`.\r\n- Added integration tests for streaming to the `StreamingQueryListenerSuite`.\r\n- Added integration tests for batch to the `DataFrameCallbackSuite`.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-15T14:41:57Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T13:00:34Z","closed_at":"2019-12-03T10:25:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"808c0c72f7a977479bb9000b3b2aa82abd95f324","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26127/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26127/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26127/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a07474c6c6131de1ae487ad96c91deb80cce2f1f","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-29348","ref":"SPARK-29348","sha":"a07474c6c6131de1ae487ad96c91deb80cce2f1f","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to update the validation check on `length` from `length >= 0` to `length >= -1` in order to allow set `-1` to keep the default value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAt Apache Spark 2.2.0, [SPARK-18702](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16133/files#diff-2c5519b1cf4308d77d6f12212971544fR27-R38) adds `class FileBlock` with the default `length` value, `-1`, initially.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to set `filePath` only while keeping `length` is `-1`.\r\n```scala\r\n  def set(filePath: String, startOffset: Long, length: Long): Unit = {\r\n     require(filePath != null, \"filePath cannot be null\")\r\n     require(startOffset >= 0, s\"startOffset ($startOffset) cannot be negative\")\r\n     require(length >= 0, s\"length ($length) cannot be negative\")\r\n     inputBlock.set(new FileBlock(UTF8String.fromString(filePath), startOffset, length))\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor compressed files (like GZ), the size of split can be set to -1. This was allowed till Spark 2.1 but regressed starting with spark 2.2.x. Please note that split length of -1 also means the length was unknown - a valid scenario. Thus, split length of -1 should be acceptable like pre Spark 2.2.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is updating the corner case on the requirement check. Manually check the code.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-15T05:00:09Z","updated_at":"2019-10-16T05:25:44Z","closed_at":"2019-10-16T05:22:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8042894e3d35b730e88bc06072db9f30f1d1af78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change implements a special handling of `pyspark.sql.Row` within the conversion of a `StructType` into an internal SQL object (`toInternal()`) to fix [SPARK-24915](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24915).\r\n\r\nPreviously, `Row` was processed as `tuple` (since it inherits from `tuple`). In particular, it was expected that values come in the \"right\" order. This works if the internal order of the `Row` (sorted by key in the current implementation) corresponds to the order of fields in the schema. If the fields have a different order *and* need special treatment (e.g. `_needConversion` is `True`) then exceptions happened when creating dataframes.\r\n\r\nWith this change, it will be processed as a `dict` if it has named columns and as tuple otherwise.\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\nRe `asDict`: I first had an implementation for `Row` as type. However, that implementation would fail for fields that are unknown to the `Row` object, this is inconsistent with the handling of `dict`s. The most consistent implementation is to convert the `Row` to `dict`.\r\n\r\nNote: The underlying problem is that `Row` inherits from `tuple`. This is visible in the tests, too. for `assertEqual` the `Row`s `Row(a=..., b=...)` and `Row(b=..., a=...)` are *not* equal because they are compared as lists (and the order is wrong) while a direct comparison returns `True` (For this reason the tests compare based on `asDict`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe code part being changed relies on `Row`s being RDD-style tuples but breaks for `Row`s created with `kwargs`.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes SPARK-24915, creating data frames from (pyspark.sql.)Rows which failed if the order of fields in the schema differed from the (internal) order of fields in the Row and the schema is \"complicated\".\r\n\r\nComplicated can be if one type of the schema is nested (as in the JIRA issue) or one field needs conversion (e.g. `DateType()`)\r\n\r\nWithout the change, the following examples fail:\r\n\r\n*From JIRA issue:*\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pyspark import SparkConf, SparkContext\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, Row\r\n\r\nconf = SparkConf().setMaster(\"local\").setAppName(\"repro\") \r\ncontext = SparkContext(conf=conf) \r\nsession = SparkSession(context)\r\nschema = StructType([\r\n    StructField('field2', StructType([StructField('sub_field', StringType(), False)]), False),\r\n    StructField('field1', StringType(), False),\r\n])\r\ndata = [Row(field1=\"Hello\", field2=Row(sub_field='world'))]\r\ndf = session.createDataFrame(data, schema=schema) # this will throw a ValueError\r\ndf.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Date example:*\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport datetime as dt\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import Row, SparkSession\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.types import StringType, DateType, StructField, StructType\r\nspark = SparkSession.builder.master(\"local\").getOrCreate()\r\nschema = StructType([\r\n    StructField(\"join_date\", DateType(), False),\r\n    StructField(\"name\", StringType(),False),\r\n])\r\nrows = [Row(name='Alice', age=23, join_date=dt.datetime(2019,10,1,23,45,56)),]\r\nspark.createDataFrame(rows, schema=schema).collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis change is not introducing User-facing changes for existing, working pyspark code.\r\n\r\nCode that previously caused exceptions b/c of the fixed bug will now work (which - technically - is a user-facing change).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Standard Tests\r\n\r\n`ARROW_PRE_0_15_IPC_FORMAT=1 ./dev/run-tests` succeeded on my machine\r\n\r\nPython: 3.7.4  \r\nSpark: master (`a42d894a4090c97a90ce23b0989163909ebf548d`)  \r\nOS: MacOS 10.14.6. \r\n\r\n#### New Tests\r\n\r\nI added the following tests in module

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen ExternalBlockStoreClient was closed, retries from RetryingBlockFetcher will cause NPE. This proposes to skip retries by RetryingBlockFetcher when ExternalBlockStoreClient is closed.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWhen ExternalBlockStoreClient was closed, retries from RetryingBlockFetcher will cause NPE:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-10-14 20:06:16 ERROR RetryingBlockFetcher:143 - Exception while beginning fetch of 2 outstanding blocks (after 3 retries)\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\nat org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.ExternalShuffleClient.lambda$fetchBlocks$0(ExternalShuffleClient.java:100)\r\nat org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.RetryingBlockFetcher.fetchAllOutstanding(RetryingBlockFetcher.java:141)\r\nat org.apache.spark.network.shuffle.RetryingBlockFetcher.lambda$initiateRetry$0(RetryingBlockFetcher.java:169)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.Executors$RunnableAdapter.call(Executors.java:511)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(FutureTask.java:266)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.runWorker(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:1149)\r\nat java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:624)\r\nat io.netty.util.concurrent.DefaultThreadFactory$DefaultRunnableDecorator.run(DefaultThreadFactory.java:138)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt was happened after BlockManager and ExternalBlockStoreClient was closed due to previous errors. In this cases, RetryingBlockFetcher does not need to retry. This NPE is harmless for job execution, but is a source of misleading when looking at log. Especially for end-users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-14T21:02:31Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:37:52Z","closed_at":"2019-10-16T05:11:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67bf7705b4ade9e6c39cb5db7d0b926892d392da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605327,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MzI3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SHUFFLE","name":"SHUFFLE","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26115/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26115/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26115/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/730708d2376c8b3e7e8f9d97e7ec5daf7a1909aa","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-29469","ref":"SPARK-29469","sha":"730708d2376c8b3e7e8f9d97e7ec5daf7a1909aa","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nChange Literal.sql to output CAST('fpValue' AS FLOAT) instead of CAST(fpValue AS FLOAT) as the SQL for a floating point literal.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe old version doesn't work for very small floating point numbers; the value will fail to parse if it doesn't fit in a DECIMAL(38).\r\n\r\nThis doesn't apply to doubles because they have special literal syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNot really.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a new column `Duration` for running drivers in Apache Spark `Standalone` master web UI in order to improve UX. This help users like the other `Duration` columns in the `Running` and `Completed` application tables.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen we use `--supervise`, the drivers can survive longer.\r\nTechnically, the `Duration` column is not the same. (Please see the image below.)\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. The red box is added newly.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1312\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-10-14 at 12 53 43 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9700541/66779127-50301b80-ee82-11e9-853f-72222cd011ac.png\">\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual since this is a UI column.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nProposed new expression `SubtractDates` which is used in `date1` - `date2`. It has the `INTERVAL` type, and returns the interval from `date1` (inclusive) and `date2` (exclusive). For example:\r\n```sql\r\n> select date'tomorrow' - date'yesterday';\r\ninterval 2 days\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses #26034\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- To conform the SQL standard which states the result type of `date operand 1` - `date operand 2` must be the interval type. See [4.5.3  Operations involving datetimes and intervals](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt).\r\n- Improve Spark SQL UX and allow mixing date and timestamp in subtractions. For example: `select timestamp'now' + (date'2019-10-01' - date'2019-09-15')`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nBefore the query below returns number of

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nmove the v2 command logical plans from `basicLogicalOperators.scala` to a new file `v2Commands.scala`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAs we keep adding v2 commands, the `basicLogicalOperators.scala` grows bigger and bigger. It's better to have a separated file for them.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the edge case of streaming left/right outer join described below:\r\n\r\nSuppose query is provided as\r\n\r\n`select * from A join B on A.id = B.id AND (A.ts <= B.ts AND B.ts <= A.ts + interval 5 seconds)`\r\n\r\nand there're two rows for L1 (from A) and R1 (from B) which ensures L1.id = R1.id and L1.ts = R1.ts.\r\n(we can simply imagine it from self-join)\r\n\r\nThen Spark processes L1 and R1 as below:\r\n\r\n- row L1 and row R1 are joined at batch 1\r\n- row R1 is evicted at batch 2 due to join and watermark condition, whereas row L1 is not evicted\r\n- row L1 is evicted at batch 3 due to join and watermark condition\r\n\r\nWhen determining outer rows to match with null, Spark applies some assumption commented in codebase, as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nChecking whether the current row matches a key in the right side state, and that key\t\r\nhas any value which satisfies the filter function when joined. If it doesn't,\t\r\nwe know we can join with null, since there was never (including this batch) a match\t\r\nwithin the watermark period. If it does, there must have been a match at some point, so\t\r\nwe know we can't join with null.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as explained the edge-case earlier, the assumption is not correct. As we don't have any good assumption to optimize which doesn't have edge-case, we have to track whether such row is matched with others before, and match with null row only when the row is not matched.\r\n\r\nTo track the matching of row, the patch adds a new state to streaming join state manager, and mark whether the row is matched to others or not. We leverage the information when dealing with eviction of rows which would be candidates to match with null rows.\r\n\r\nThis approach introduces new state format which is not compatible with old state format - queries with old state format will be still running but they will still have the issue and be required to discard checkpoint and rerun to take this patch in effect.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes a correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo for compatibility viewpoint, but we'll encourage end users to discard the old checkpoint and rerun the query if they run stream-stream outer join query with old checkpoint, which might be \"yes\" for the question.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded UT which fails on current Spark and passes with this patch. Also passed existing streaming join UTs.","created_at":"2019-10-14T07:26:01Z","updated_at":"2020-04-08T06:41:19Z","closed_at":"2019-11-11T23:47:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1206191d4b84038cb42d617fcf6865b58e619d1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

Currently, we support 3 policies for the store assignment rules: ANSI, legacy and strict, which can be set via the option \"spark.sql.storeAssignmentPolicy\":\r\n1. ANSI: Spark performs the type coercion as per ANSI SQL. In practice, the behavior is mostly the same as PostgreSQL. It disallows certain unreasonable type conversions such as converting `string` to `int` and `double` to `boolean`. It will throw a runtime exception if the value is out-of-range(overflow).\r\n2. Legacy: Spark allows the type coercion as long as it is a valid `Cast`, which is very loose. E.g., converting either `string` to `int` or `double` to `boolean` is allowed. It is the current behavior in Spark 2.x for compatibility with Hive. When inserting an out-of-range value to a integral field, the low-order bits of the value is inserted(the same as Java/Scala numeric type casting). For example, if 257 is inserted to a field of Byte type, the result is 1.\r\n3. Strict: Spark doesn't allow any possible precision loss or data truncation in store assignment, e.g., converting either `double` to `int` or `decimal` to `double` is allowed. The rules are originally for Dataset encoder. As far as I know, no mainstream DBMS is using this policy by default.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the V1 data source uses \"Legacy\" policy by default, while V2 uses \"Strict\". This proposal is to use \"ANSI\" policy by default for both V1 and V2 in Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFollowing the ANSI SQL standard is most reasonable among the 3 policies. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes. \r\nThe default store assignment policy is ANSI for both V1 and V2 data sources.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThere will be 2 times unsafeProjection convert operation When we read a Parquet data file use non-vectorized mode:\r\n\r\n1.  `ParquetGroupConverter` call unsafeProjection function to covert `SpecificInternalRow` to `UnsafeRow` every times when read Parquet data file use `ParquetRecordReader`.\r\n\r\n2. `ParquetFileFormat` will call unsafeProjection function to covert this `UnsafeRow` to another `UnsafeRow` again when partitionSchema is not empty in DataSourceV1 branch, and `PartitionReaderWithPartitionValues` will  always do this convert operation in DataSourceV2 branch.\r\n\r\nIn this pr,  remove `unsafeProjection` convert operation in `ParquetGroupConverter` and change `ParquetRecordReader`  to produce `SpecificInternalRow`  instead of `UnsafeRow`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe first time convert in `ParquetGroupConverter` is redundant and `ParquetRecordReader` return a `InternalRow(SpecificInternalRow)` is enough.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to wrap the collected SerializableFileStatus with SoftReference, when collecting file statuses in InMemoryFileIndex.bulkListLeafFiles.\r\n\r\nThen later when we transform SerializableFileStatus back to Status, if there is memory pressure, traversed SerializableFileStatus can be candidates for GC.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe get an array of (String, Seq[SerializableFileStatus]) when collecting file status in InMemoryFileIndex.bulkListLeafFiles. Then later we transform it back to sequence of (Path, Seq[FileStatus]).\r\n\r\nDuring the transforming, the items in the array are hold and can not be released by GC. Actually we double memory consumption here.\r\n\r\nThis change wraps the sequence of SerializableFileStatus with SoftReference in the array. So when we transform SerializableFileStatus back to Status, if there is memory pressure, traversed SerializableFileStatus can be candidates for GC.\r\n\r\nIf SerializableFileStatus that is not traversed yet is cleared up by GC, we log necessary to users suggesting increasing driver memory. Then we re-list file status for the path.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the PR, I propose to support Catalyst's `CalendarIntervalType` in the Parquet datasource. Interval values are saved as parquet `INTERVAL` logical type according to the format specification - https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#interval .\r\n\r\nParquet format allows to store intervals in millisecond precision. Because of this restriction, values of Spark's `INTERVAL` type have to be truncated to milliseconds before storing to parquet files. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n- Spark users will be able to load interval columns stored to parquet files in other systems\r\n- Datasets with interval columns can be stored to parquet files for future processing\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes. Before, write to parquet files fails with the error:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"interval 10 year as i\").write.parquet(\"intervals\")\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: Cannot save interval data type into external storage.;\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.range(1).selectExpr(\"interval 10 year as i\").write.parquet(\"intervals\")\r\nscala> spark.read.parquet(\"intervals\").show(false)\r\n+-----------------+\r\n|i                |\r\n+-----------------+\r\n|interval 10 years|\r\n+-----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Add tests to `ParquetSchemaSuite` and `ParquetIOSuite`\r\n- by end-to-end test in `ParquetQuerySuite` which writes intervals and read them back\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-12T10:38:28Z","updated_at":"2020-06-05T19:41:57Z","closed_at":"2020-01-15T20:49:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c2cfa2c671f7e5821ffabd46d4fceb2dedce2f8d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26102/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26102/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26102/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/904111049f95d066dd53bc208d253454add85b17","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:parquet-interval","ref":"parquet-interval","sha":"904111049f95d066dd53bc208d253454add85b17","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs mentioned in jira, sometimes we need to be able to support the retention of null columns when writing JSON. \r\nFor example, sparkmagic(used widely in jupyter with livy) will generate sql query results based on DataSet.toJSON and parse JSON to pandas DataFrame to display. If there is a null column, it is easy to have some column missing or even the query result is empty. The loss of the null column in the first row, may cause parsing exceptions or loss of entire column data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nExample in spark-shell.\r\nscala>

Hive compatibility\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we address the first one:\r\n- [ ] Using `USING provider` to specify a different table provider in CREATE TABLE LIKE.\r\n- [  ] Using `STORED AS file_format` in CREATE TABLE LIKE to address Hive compatibility.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUse CREATE TABLE tb1 LIKE tb2 command to create an empty table tb1 based on the definition of table tb2. The most user case is to create tb1 with the same schema of tb2. But an inconvenient case here is this command also copies the FileFormat from tb2, it cannot change the input/output format and serde. Add the ability of changing file format is useful for some scenarios like upgrading a table from a low performance file format to a high performance one (parquet, orc).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nAdd a new syntax based on current CTL:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE tbl2 LIKE tbl [USING parquet];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModify some exist UTs.","created_at":"2019-10-12T04:25:32Z","updated_at":"2019-11-11T07:26:08Z","closed_at":"2019-11-11T07:26:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75a2d47f3b1576b95e82d138e942ffd941ee6de9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26097/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26097/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26097/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0ae26a627060c576d9daea23bd2eb17e4ec81b55","head":{"label":"LantaoJin:SPARK-29421","ref":"SPARK-29421","sha":"0ae26a627060c576d9daea23bd2eb17e4ec81b55","user":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90969496,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDk2OTQ5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"LantaoJin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LantaoJin","id":1853780,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTM3ODA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1853780?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin","html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LantaoJin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LantaoJin/spark","description":"Mirror

sun.nio.fs.UnixException.translateToIOException(UnixException.java:86)\r\n\r\nAs per [SPARK-25341](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-25341) `mapId` of `SortShuffleManager.getWriter `changed to `context.taskAttemptId() ` from `partitionId`\r\n\r\n[code]( https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25620/files#diff-363c53ca5a72cfdc37dac4a723309638R54)\r\n\r\nBut `MapOutputTracker.convertMapStatuses` returns the wrong ShuffleBlock, if `spark.shuffle.useOldFetchProtocol `enabled, it returns `paritionId` as `mapID` which is wrong . [Code](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/MapOutputTracker.scala#L912)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAlready MapStatus returned by the ShuffleWriter has the mapId for e.g.[ code here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/shuffle/sort/BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter.java#L134). So it's nice to use `status.mapTaskId`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting UT  and manually tested with `spark.shuffle.useOldFetchProtocol` as true and false\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35216143/66716530-4f4caa80-edec-11e9-833d-7131a9fbd442.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-11T18:43:11Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T03:54:26Z","closed_at":"2019-10-14T16:03:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d99b1b0d2c7eb10568a4d2445a95fc3172bf3d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix the behavior of `mode(\"default\")` to set `SaveMode.ErrorIfExists`. Also, this PR updates the exception message by adding `default` explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is reported during `GRAPH API` PR. This builder pattern should work like the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes if the app has multiple `mode()` invocation including `mode(\"default\")` and the `mode(\"default\")` is the last invocation. This is really a corner case.\r\n- Previously, the last invocation was handled as `No-Op`.\r\n- After this bug fix, it will work like the documentation.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdated kubernetes client. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27812\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-27927\r\n\r\nWe need this fix https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/pull/1768 that was released on version 4.6 of the client. The root cause of the problem is better explained in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25785\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNope, it should be transparent to users\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested manually using a simple pyspark job\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected behaviour of this \"job\" is that both python's and jvm's process exit automatically after the main runs. This is the case for spark versions <= 2.4. On version 2.4.3, the jvm process hangs because there's a non daemon thread running \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"OkHttp WebSocket https://10.96.0.1/...\" #121 prio=5 os_prio=0 tid=0x00007fb27c005800 nid=0x24b

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to convert values of the `CalendarIntervalType` Catalyst's type to the `java.time.Duration` values when such values are need outside of Spark, for example in UDF. If an `INTERVAL` values has non-zero `months` field, it is converted to number of seconds assuming `2629746` seconds per months. This average number of seconds per month was given by assuming that the average year of the Gregorian calendar `365.2425` days long (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar): `60 * 60 * 24 * 365.2425` = `31556952.0` = `12 * 2629746`.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nscala> val plusDay = udf((i: java.time.Duration) => i.plusDays(1))\r\nplusDay: org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.UserDefinedFunction = SparkUserDefinedFunction($Lambda$1855/165450258@485996f7,CalendarIntervalType,List(Some(Schema(CalendarIntervalType,true))),None,true,true)\r\n\r\nscala> val df = spark.sql(\"SELECT interval 40 minutes as i\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [i: interval]\r\n\r\nscala> df.show\r\n+-------------------+                                                           \r\n|                  i|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n|interval 40 minutes|\r\n+-------------------+\r\n\r\nscala> df.select(plusDay('i)).show(false)\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|UDF(i)                    |\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n|interval 1 days 40 minutes|\r\n+--------------------------+\r\n```\r\nI added an implicit encoder for `java.time.Duration` which allows to create Spark dataframe from an external collections:\r\n```sql\r\nscala> Seq(Duration.ofDays(10), Duration.ofHours(10)).toDS.show(false)\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n|value                  |\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n|interval 1 weeks 3 days|\r\n|interval 10 hours      |\r\n+-----------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis should allow to users:\r\n- Write UDF over interval inputs\r\n- Use Java 8 libraries for `java.time.Duration` in manipulations on collected values or in UDFs\r\n- Create dataframes from a collection of `java.time.Duration` values.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, currently `collect()` returns not public class `CalendarInterval`:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select interval 1 week\").collect().apply(0).get(0).isInstanceOf[org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.CalendarInterval]\r\nres2: Boolean = true\r\n```\r\nAfter the changes:\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"select interval 1 week\").collect().apply(0).get(0).isInstanceOf[Duration]\r\nres8: Boolean = true\r\n```\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added new testes to `CatalystTypeConvertersSuite` to check conversion of `CalendarIntervalType` to/from `java.time.Duration`\r\n- By `JavaUDFSuite`/ `UDFSuite` to test usage of `Duration` type in Scala/Java

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCreate a new node `ResolvedV2Table`, and resolve `UnresolvedV2Relation` to this new node instead of `DataSourceV2Relation`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`DataSourceV2Relation` is a scan node. It should be used when we want to scan a v2 table. However, the DDL commands do not need to scan a v2 table, they just need a node to hold the v2 table. It's possible that there are rules trying to match `DataSourceV2Relation` and convert it to something else (e.g. a new `DataSourceV2ScanRelation`), for better data scan. Unfortunately doing this will break these DDL commands. It's better to have a separated node to hold the v2 table for DDL commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

It creates KeyValueGroupedDataset instance using existing relational columns, instead of a typed function in groupByKey API. Because it leverages existing columns, it can use existing data partition, if any, when doing operations like cogroup.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently if users want to do cogroup on DataFrames, there is no good way to do except for KeyValueGroupedDataset.\r\n\r\n1. KeyValueGroupedDataset ignores existing data partition if any. That is a problem.\r\n2. groupByKey calls typed function to create additional keys. You can not reuse existing columns, if you just need grouping by them.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// df1 and df2 are certainly partitioned and sorted.\r\nval df1 = Seq((1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\r\n  .repartition($\"a\", $\"b\").sortWithinPartitions(\"a\", \"b\")\r\nval df2 = Seq((1, 2, 4), (2, 3, 5)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\", \"c\")\r\n  .repartition($\"a\", $\"b\").sortWithinPartitions(\"a\", \"b\")\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\n// This groupByRelationKey won't unnecessarily repartition the data \r\nval df3 = df1.groupByRelationKey(\"a\", \"b\")\r\n  .cogroup(df2.groupByRelationKey(\"a\", \"b\")) { case (key, data1, data2) =>\r\n    data1.zip(data2).map { p =>\r\n      p._1.getInt(2) + p._2.getInt(2)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nNow, for a dynamic partition overwrite operation, the filename of a task output is determined by splitId(taskId) and jobId.\r\n\r\nSo, if speculation is enabled, a task would conflict with its relative speculation task.\r\nIn this PR, I make the file name of a task for dynamic partition overwrite be unique.\r\n\r\nAnd the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInstead of using GZIP for compressing the serialized `MapStatuses`, ZStd provides better compression rate and faster compression time.\r\n\r\nThe original approach is serializing and writing data directly into `GZIPOutputStream` as one step; however, the compression time is faster if a bigger chuck of the data is processed by the codec at once. As a result, in this PR, the serialized data is written into an uncompressed byte array first, and then the data is compressed. For smaller `MapStatues`, we find it's 2x faster.\r\n\r\nHere is the benchmark result.\r\n\r\n#### 20k map outputs, and each has 500 blocks\r\n1. ZStd two steps in this PR: 0.402 ops/ms, 89,066 bytes\r\n2. ZStd one step as the original approach: 0.370 ops/ms, 89,069 bytes\r\n3. GZip: 0.092 ops/ms, 217,345 bytes\r\n\r\n#### 20k map outputs, and each has 5 blocks\r\n1. ZStd two steps in this PR: 0.9 ops/ms, 75,449 bytes\r\n2. ZStd one step as the original approach: 0.38 ops/ms, 75,452 bytes\r\n3. GZip: 0.21 ops/ms, 160,094 bytes\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDecrease the time for serializing the `MapStatuses` in large scale job.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWith this pull request I want to improve the Web UI / SQL tab visualization. The principal problem that I find is when you have a cache in your plan, the SQL visualization don’t show any information about the part of the plan that has been cached.\r\n\r\nBefore the change\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12819544/66587418-aa7f6280-eb8a-11e9-80cf-bf10d6c0abea.png)\r\nAfter the change

dataframes we lose the graphical information of this dataframe in the sql tab\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, in the sql tab\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to move interval parsing to `CalendarInterval.fromCaseInsensitiveString()` which throws an `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid strings, and reuse it from `CalendarInterval.fromString()`. The former one handles `IllegalArgumentException` only and returns `NULL` for invalid interval strings. This will allow to support interval strings without the `interval` prefix in casting strings to intervals and in interval type constructor because they use `fromString()` for parsing string intervals.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select cast('1 year 10 days' as interval);\r\ninterval 1 years 1 weeks 3 days\r\nspark-sql> SELECT INTERVAL '1 YEAR 10 DAYS';\r\ninterval 1 years 1 weeks 3 days\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo maintain feature parity with PostgreSQL which supports interval strings without prefix:\r\n```sql\r\n# select interval '2 months 1 microsecond';\r\n        interval        \r\n------------------------\r\n 2 mons 00:00:00.000001\r\n```\r\nand to improve Spark SQL UX.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes, previously parsing of interval strings without `interval` gives `NULL`:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select interval '2 months 1 microsecond';\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select interval '2 months 1 microsecond';\r\ninterval 2 months 1 microseconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added new tests to `CalendarIntervalSuite.java`\r\n- A test for casting strings to intervals in `CastSuite`\r\n- Test for interval type constructor from strings in `ExpressionParserSuite`\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-10T07:42:56Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T19:56:40Z","closed_at":"2019-10-14T15:34:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ff1e185fd37f97bcb623de68384d47c0b50f4461","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26079/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26079/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26079/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e2c1352c66ca8a74d74e154513fe4b9546fc7537","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:interval-str-without-prefix","ref":"interval-str-without-prefix","sha":"e2c1352c66ca8a74d74e154513fe4b9546fc7537","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds the ability for tasks to request fractional resources, in order to be able to execute more than 1 task per resource. For example, if you have 1 GPU in the executor, and the task configuration is 0.5 GPU/task, the executor can schedule two tasks to run on that 1 GPU.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently there is no good way to share a resource such that multiple tasks can run on a single unit. This allows multiple tasks to share an executor resource.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes: There is a configuration change where `spark.task.resource.[resource type].amount` can now be fractional.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests and manually on standalone mode, and yarn.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-09T21:50:47Z","updated_at":"2019-11-06T23:25:20Z","closed_at":"2019-11-05T14:58:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a63838dc673bdd10f1f8b334f35a57fd6e38fad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406606875,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA2ODc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SCHEDULER","name":"SCHEDULER","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26078/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26078/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26078/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d579c5d50ee793a09eebbb94f7998012ec81aa1e","head":{"label":"abellina:SPARK-29151","ref":"SPARK-29151","sha":"d579c5d50ee793a09eebbb94f7998012ec81aa1e","user":{"login":"abellina","id":1901059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDEwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1901059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina","html_url":"https://github.com/abellina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143883563,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM4ODM1NjM=","name":"spark","full_name":"abellina/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abellina","id":1901059,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5MDEwNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1901059?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina","html_url":"https://github.com/abellina","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abellina/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abellina/spark","description":"Mirror

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a thread-safety bug in `SparkSession.createDataset(Seq)`: if the caller-supplied `Encoder` is used in multiple threads then createDataset's usage of the encoder may lead to incorrect / corrupt results because the Encoder's internal mutable state will be updated from multiple threads.\r\n\r\nHere is an example demonstrating the problem:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql._\r\n\r\nval enc = implicitly[Encoder[(Int, Int)]]\r\n\r\nval datasets = (1 to 100).par.map { _ =>\r\n  val pairs = (1 to 100).map(x => (x, x))\r\n  spark.createDataset(pairs)(enc)\r\n}\r\n\r\ndatasets.reduce(_ union _).collect().foreach {\r\n  pair => require(pair._1 == pair._2, s\"Pair elements are mismatched: $pair\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore this PR's change, the above example fails because Spark produces corrupted records where different input records' fields have been co-mingled.\r\n\r\nThis bug is similar to SPARK-22355 / #19577, a similar problem in `Dataset.collect()`.\r\n\r\nThe fix implemented here is based on #24735's updated version of the `Datataset.collect()` bugfix: use `.copy()`. For consistency, I used same [code comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/d841b33ba3a9b0504597dbccd4b0d11fa810abf3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/Dataset.scala#L3414) / explanation as that PR.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested manually using the example listed above.\r\n\r\nThanks to @smcnamara-stripe for identifying this bug.","created_at":"2019-10-09T20:44:32Z","updated_at":"2020-03-02T01:22:41Z","closed_at":"2020-03-02T01:19:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c3c6b4cc946e6abb036972d23d49ab56d8760ff2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zsxwing","id":1000778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDA3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1000778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing","html_url":"https://github.com/zsxwing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zsxwing/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26076/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26076/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26076/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/62de6780523dc762f181c1697440fe645c74893b","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-29419","ref":"SPARK-29419","sha":"62de6780523dc762f181c1697440fe645c74893b","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

current RPC backend in Spark supports single- and multi-threaded\r\nmessage delivery to endpoints, but they all share the same underlying\r\nthread pool. So an RPC endpoint that blocks a dispatcher thread can\r\nnegatively affect other endpoints.\r\n\r\nThis can be more pronounced with configurations that limit the number\r\nof RPC dispatch threads based on configuration and / or running\r\nenvironment. And exposing the RPC layer to other code (for example\r\nwith something like SPARK-29396) could make it easy to affect normal\r\nSpark operation with a badly written RPC handler.\r\n\r\nThis change adds a new RPC endpoint type that tells the RPC env to\r\ncreate dedicated dispatch threads, so that those effects are minimised.\r\nOther endpoints will still need CPU to process their messages, but\r\nthey won't be able to actively block the dispatch thread of these\r\nisolated endpoints.\r\n\r\nAs part of the change, I've changed the most important Spark endpoints\r\n(the driver, executor and block manager endpoints) to be isolated from\r\nothers. This means a couple of extra threads are created on the driver\r\nand executor for these endpoints.\r\n\r\nTested with existing unit tests, which hammer the RPC system extensively,\r\nand also by

change adds a new method to the Clock interface that returns\r\nthe time from a monotonic time source, so that code that needs that\r\nfeature can also mock the Clock in tests.\r\n\r\nThe original getTimeMillis and waitTillTime methods are unchanged, since\r\nstreaming code that uses the Clock interface seems to rely on wall clock\r\nsemantics, not monotonic clock. So, in a way, this doesn't directly\r\naddress the problem raised in the bug, that waitTillTime can be affected\r\nby drift, but then the places being modified to use the new API don't\r\nreally rely on that API.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic allocation code was modified to use the new time source,\r\nsince they shouldn't be basing their decisions on wall clock time.\r\n\r\nFor a longer discussion on how monotonic clocks work on Linux/x64, the\r\nfollowing blog post (and links within) shed a lot of light on the safety of\r\n`System.nanoTime()`:\r\n\r\nhttp://btorpey.github.io/blog/2014/02/18/clock-sources-in-linux/\r\n\r\nTested with unit test and also running apps with dynamic allocation

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSet the default value of the `spark.sql.legacy.sizeOfNull` config to `false`. That changes behavior of the `size()` function for `NULL`. The function will return `NULL` for `NULL` instead of `-1`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThere is the agreement in the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21598#issuecomment-399695523 to change behavior in Spark 3.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select size(NULL);\r\n-1\r\n```\r\nAfter:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> select size(NULL);\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy the `check outputs of expression examples` test in `SQLQuerySuite` which runs expression examples.\r\n","created_at":"2019-10-08T07:00:19Z","updated_at":"2020-02-05T18:26:14Z","closed_at":"2019-10-08T11:57:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"50e42ed01791573d760ba1effe54587e26477567","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/26051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/26051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a8a0a981b63280e2441146d1502764fb277596b5","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:sizeof-null-returns-null","ref":"sizeof-null-returns-null","sha":"a8a0a981b63280e2441146d1502764fb277596b5","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims the followings.\r\n- Refactor `TPCDSQueryBenchmark` to use main method to improve the usability.\r\n- Reduce the number of iteration from 5 to 2 because it takes too long. (2 is okay because we have `Stdev` field now. If there is an irregular run, we can notice easily with that).\r\n- Generate one result file for TPCDS scale factor 1. (Note that this test suite can be used for the other scale factors, too.)\r\n  - AWS EC2 `r3.xlarge` with `ami-06f2f779464715dc5 (ubuntu-bionic-18.04-amd64-server-20190722.1)` is used.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a JDK8 result based on the TPCDS ScaleFactor 1G data generated by the following.\r\n```\r\n# `spark-tpcds-datagen` needs this. (JDK8)\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/apache/spark.git -b branch-2.4 --depth 1 spark-2.4\r\n$ export SPARK_HOME=$PWD\r\n$ ./build/mvn clean package -DskipTests\r\n\r\n# Generate data. (JDK8)\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:maropu/spark-tpcds-datagen.git\r\n$ cd spark-tpcds-datagen/\r\n$ build/mvn clean package\r\n$ mkdir -p /data/tpcds\r\n$ ./bin/dsdgen --output-location /data/tpcds/s1  // This need `Spark 2.4`\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAlthough the generated TPCDS data is random, we can keep the record. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. (This is dev-only test benchmark).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually run the benchmark. Please note that you need to have TPCDS data.\r\n```\r\nSPARK_GENERATE_BENCHMARK_FILES=1 build/sbt \"sql/test:runMain org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.TPCDSQueryBenchmark --data-location

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe current docker image used by Kubernetes is `openjdk:8-alpine`. It was not supported and  was removed with the commit https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk/commit/3eb0351b208d739fac35345c85e3c6237c2114ec#diff-f95ffa3d1377774732c33f7b8368e099.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move to a supported docker image.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI think there are at least two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. According to the commit, Alpine/musl is not officially supported by the OpenJDK project.\r\n2. As no more OpenJDK 8 Alpine images, new JDK updates including security fixes\r\n, are not applied to it. See below:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it --rm openjdk:8-alpine java -version\r\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_212\"\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 3.12.0) (Alpine 8.212.04-r0)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.212-b04, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n```\r\ndocker run -it --rm openjdk:8-jdk-slim java -version\r\nopenjdk version \"1.8.0_222\"\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_222-b10)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.222-b10, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce any user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. This changes the base docker image of Spark.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting
