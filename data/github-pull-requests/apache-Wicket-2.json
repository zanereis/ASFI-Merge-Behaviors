https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WICKET-7119\r\n\r\n# The Problem\r\n\r\n\r\nSome unit tests are non-idempotent, as they pass in the first run but fail in the second run in the same environment. A fix is necessary since unit tests shall be self-contained, ensuring that the state of the system under test is consistent at the beginning of each test. In practice, fixing non-idempotent tests can help proactively avoid state pollution that results in test order dependency (which could cause problems under test selection, prioritization or parallelization).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the `NIOInspector` plugin that supports rerunning JUnit tests in the same environment. Use `org.apache.wicket.util.string.StringsTest#stripJSessionId` as an example:\r\n```\r\ncd wicket-util\r\nmvn edu.illinois:NIOInspector:rerun -Dtest=org.apache.wicket.util.string.StringsTest#stripJSessionId\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# 5 Non-Idempotent Tests & Proposed Fix\r\n## org.apache.wicket.util.string.StringsTest#stripJSessionId\r\nReason: The `SESSION_ID_PARAM` field in `Strings`(see https://github.com/apache/wicket/blob/37c80e8c54533257c9fc5737424847a61e889b4e/wicket-util/src/main/java/org/apache/wicket/util/string/Strings.java#L74) contains semicolon by default, but `stripJSessionId()` resets it to `\"jsessionid\"` (see https://github.com/apache/wicket/blob/37c80e8c54533257c9fc5737424847a61e889b4e/wicket-util/src/test/java/org/apache/wicket/util/string/StringsTest.java#L62) when doing cleanup. As a result, `assertEquals(url, Strings.stripJSessionId(url + \";jsessionid=12345\"));` will fail in the second test execution due to the missing semicolon.\r\n\r\nError message of the test in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <http://localhost/abc> but was: <http://localhost/abc;>\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.build(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:151)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.buildAndThrow(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:132)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.failNotEqual(AssertEquals.java:197)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.assertEquals(AssertEquals.java:182)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.assertEquals(AssertEquals.java:177)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(Assertions.java:1145)\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.util.string.StringsTest.stripJSessionId(StringsTest.java:43)\r\n```\r\nFix: Save the original value of the field `SESSION_ID_PARAM` before modifying it, and restore it to the saved value at the end of the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## org.apache.wicket.resource.FileSystemResourceReferenceTest#testFileSystemResourceReferenceWithZip\r\nReason: `FileSystemAlreadyExistsException` occurs when calling `FileSystemResourceReference.getPath()` because the file system for the zip file is already mounted when the test is executed a second time. \r\n\r\nError message in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\njava.nio.file.FileSystemAlreadyExistsException: null\r\n\tat jdk.zipfs/jdk.nio.zipfs.ZipFileSystemProvider.newFileSystem(ZipFileSystemProvider.java:104)\r\n\tat java.base/java.nio.file.FileSystems.newFileSystem(FileSystems.java:339)\r\n\tat java.base/java.nio.file.FileSystems.newFileSystem(FileSystems.java:288)\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.resource.FileSystemJarPathService.getPath(FileSystemJarPathService.java:75)\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.resource.FileSystemResourceReference.getPath(FileSystemResourceReference.java:180)\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.resource.FileSystemResourceReference.getPath(FileSystemResourceReference.java:204)\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.resource.FileSystemResourceReferenceTest.testFileSystemResourceReferenceWithZip(FileSystemResourceReferenceTest.java:58)\r\n```\r\nFix: Check if the file system for the zip file is already available before creating a new one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## org.apache.wicket.markup.repeater.AbstractPageableViewTest#cachedItemCount\r\nReason: `View.getItemCount()` calls `View.internalGetItemCount()`, which is dependent on the static variable `count`. The test `cachedItemCount()` resets `count` to 8 without resetting it, so in the second test execution `view.getItemCount()` would be 8 instead of 5.\r\n\r\nError message of one of the tests in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <5> but was: <8>\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.build(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:151)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.buildAndThrow(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:132)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.failNotEqual(AssertEquals.java:197)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.assertEquals(AssertEquals.java:166)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.assertEquals(AssertEquals.java:161)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(Assertions.java:632)\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.markup.repeater.AbstractPageableViewTest.cachedItemCount(AbstractPageableViewTest.java:44)\r\n```\r\nFix:  Add a `@BeforeEach` method to ensure `count` is reset to 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n## org.apache.wicket.ComponentOnConfigureTest#order\r\nReason: Similarly, the static atomic integers are not reset before / after the test, so they get accumulated across multiple test runs, causing assertion failures.\r\n\r\nError message of one of the tests in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: Page must be configured first! ==> expected: <0> but was: <6>\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.build(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:151)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertionFailureBuilder.buildAndThrow(AssertionFailureBuilder.java:132)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.failNotEqual(AssertEquals.java:197)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.AssertEquals.assertEquals(AssertEquals.java:150)\r\n\tat org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals(Assertions.java:563)\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.ComponentOnConfigureTest.order(ComponentOnConfigureTest.java:54)\r\n```\r\nFix:  Add a `@BeforeEach` method to ensure the static atomic integers are reset to 0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## org.apache.wicket.pageStore.AbstractPersistentPageStoreTest#rebindingAttributeDoesNotRemoveAllPages\r\nReason: The constructor of `AbstractPersistentPageStore` checks if the input application name string already exists in the static concurrent map `STORES` (this would be the case in the second test execution), and throws `IllegalStateException` if so. \r\n\r\nError message of one of the tests in the repeated run:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Store with key 'fooBar:' already exists.\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.pageStore.AbstractPersistentPageStore.<init>(AbstractPersistentPageStore.java:67)\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.pageStore.AbstractPersistentPageStoreTest$1.<init>(AbstractPersistentPageStoreTest.java:44)\r\n\tat org.apache.wicket.pageStore.AbstractPersistentPageStoreTest.rebindingAttributeDoesNotRemoveAllPages(AbstractPersistentPageStoreTest.java:43)\r\n```\r\nFix:  Call `store.destroy()` to delete `'fooBar'` from the `STORES` map.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Verifying this change\r\nAfter the patch, running the tests repeatedly in the same environment will not lead to
