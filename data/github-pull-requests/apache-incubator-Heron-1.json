Refactoring of the K8s Shim\r\n\r\nThis issue is not related to a release and will be a code quality improvement. Closes #3846.\r\n\r\nThe [`V1Controller`](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/master/heron/schedulers/src/java/org/apache/heron/scheduler/kubernetes/V1Controller.java) is a Shim to interface with the K8s cluster(s). It should only contain methods that support this functionality. All methods that communicate with the Cluster are retained in the `KubernetesShim` class. All methods that support the creation and configuration of the `Stateful Set`s are moved to the `StatefulSet` factory class. Data with cluster configurations and config maps are passed to the factory via the `Configs` container class.\r\n\r\n#### __Kubernetes Shim:__\r\n\r\n- `Constructor`\r\n- `submit`\r\n-

build script cleanup leveraging the Bazel platforms feature.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/aosp-riscv/platform-build-bazel\r\n\r\nContext below:\r\n\r\nWhile working through a bug we ran into with MacOS failing to compile, I got a better understanding of some of the Bazel settings. In another thread with Josh, who is compiling on the Apple M1 for the first time, he ran into issues with Linux vs OSX.\r\n\r\nIt dawned on me that we were explicitly setting the config to modify a number of settings. Some of them include the following items:\r\n1. Platform libraries (Linux C libraries)\r\n2. Platform + CPU decision on which binary to use (Helm binary)\r\n3. OS decision (MacOS unique steps vs Linux as the default)\r\n4. Optimization setting (We just hardcoded to C03, but Bazel reported as \"fastbuild\")\r\n5. Stylecheck toggle (darwin vs darwin_nostyle)\r\n\r\nIn a [recent PR](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/pull/3646), I collapsed all of the Linux flavors to a standard `--config=linux`. This was born out of my frustration with the build scripts not jiving with Bazel standards. But it was not actually solving the problem. I'm hoping that this PR will help resolve some of the issues. \r\n\r\nChanges: \r\n\r\n1. No longer need to set `--config`. Bazel will detect the OS automatically.\r\n2. Default is `fastbuild`, but you can add `-c opt` to build optimized build.  \r\na. You can even build both side by side with Bazel making a folder like darwin-fastbuild and darwin-opt3. If you want to run stylecheck, you can add `--config=stylecheck`\r\n4. The Linux libraries (-lm, -lpthread, -lrt) are included in `tools/platform/BUILD`\r\n5. As we add support for ARM, we can add more options in `tools/platform/BUILD`6. Scripts outside of Bazel were updated to remove `--config`.\r\n7. Scripts outside of Bazel will specify  `-c opt` or `--config=stylecheck` when needed.","created_at":"2022-02-27T06:38:49Z","updated_at":"2022-03-25T20:55:46Z","closed_at":"2022-03-25T20:55:41Z","merged_at":"2022-03-25T20:55:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"8841d1c4d6b3156a40ffed856fb32c1ceb682855","assignee":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nwangtw","id":6353055,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTMwNTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6353055?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw","html_url":"https://github.com/nwangtw","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nwangtw/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"Code0x58","id":9309570,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzMDk1NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9309570?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58","html_url":"https://github.com/Code0x58","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Code0x58/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":419524893,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MTk1MjQ4OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/labels/build","name":"build","color":"c2e0c6","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/pulls/3779/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/pulls/3779/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3779/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/statuses/7d97acff9c305883ddf7bc4b6a061eadfa18fe92","head":{"label":"apache:nicknezis/bazel-platforms","ref":"nicknezis/bazel-platforms","sha":"7d97acff9c305883ddf7bc4b6a061eadfa18fe92","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercon

`shared_ptr`.","created_at":"2022-01-24T15:14:12Z","updated_at":"2022-01-24T19:26:12Z","closed_at":"2022-01-24T19:25:59Z","merged_at":"2022-01-24T19:25:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"638cff1a563c8184619dca166664429b7652be78","assignee":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"huijunwu","id":4208547,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDg1NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4208547?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu","html_url":"https://github.com/huijunwu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huijunwu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/pulls/3767/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/pulls/3767/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3767/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/statuses/1c7aaf3d642de2cb9b3764a3dd2b8dd0c0139174","head":{"label":"apache:nicknezis/stmgr-unittest-fix","ref":"nicknezis/stmgr-unittest-fix","sha":"1c7aaf3d642de2cb9b3764a3dd2b8dd0c0139174","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43158694,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MzE1ODY5NA==","name":"incubator-heron","full_name":"apache/incubator-heron","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","grava

support this is C++14.

comments.","created_at":"2022-01-17T04:13:43Z","updated_at":"2022-01-17T16:56:22Z","closed_at":"2022-01-17T16:50:38Z","merged_at":"2022-01-17T16:50:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"482f14fd56de7d1803a9b1c4a37568514a826d27","assignee":{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nicknezis","id":181930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MTkzMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/181930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis","html_url":"https://github.com/nicknezis","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicknezis/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"surahman","id":3979925,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5Nzk5MjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3979925?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman","html_url":"https://github.com/surahman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/surahman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"joshfischer1108","id":5785700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3ODU3MDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5785700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108","html_url":"https://github.com/joshfischer1108","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshfischer1108/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":452958769,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0NTI5NTg3Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/labels/Kubernetes","name":"Kubernetes","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/pulls/3758/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/pulls/3758/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/issues/3758/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/incubator-heron/statuses/5d0ba58aa8fad2ffded93245009bbb546cd21930","head":{"label":"apache:nicknezis/helm-cleanup","ref":"nicknezis/helm-cleanup","sha":"5d0ba58aa8fad2ffded93245009bbb546cd21930","user":{"login":"a

The duplicate PR is closed #3744 due to tracking the wrong branch (`-dev`).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for specifying `Empty Dir`, `Host Path`, and `NFS` via CLI commands.\r\n\r\nFor further details please see the [documentation](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/aae2f0f3fb346149fe6e4ac3deee46ded8efedf4/website2/docs/schedulers-k8s-execution-environment.md) and the [relevant section](https://github.com/apache/incubator-heron/blob/aae2f0f3fb346149fe6e4ac3deee46ded8efedf4/website2/docs/schedulers-k8s-execution-environment.md#adding-empty-directory-host-path-and-nework-file-system-volumes-via-the-command-line-interface). Please note that the Helm charts and the commands to disable Volumes configuration specification via the CLI has been updated as well.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Commands</summary>\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/bin/heron submit kubernetes ~/.heron/examples/heron-api-examples.jar \\\r\norg.apache.heron.examples.api.AckingTopology acking

#3724: Management/Driver pod should not use the same resources as the other topology pods. Should create separate deployment/service.***\r\n\r\nThis PR builds upon #3725 in order to test the functionality of Volume Claim configurations in the `Manager`. Once #3725 is merged into `master` I will hard-reset the feature branch for this PR onto `master` (this may temporarily close the PR). After that, I will merge the `dev` branch with the feature branch again and resolve any merge conflicts which may arise.\r\n\r\nThe following are the current features and I am soliciting input across all areas:\r\n\r\n* The `StatefulSet`s are named `[topology-name]-manager` and `[topology-name]-executors`.\r\n* A single headless `Service` is used.\r\n* The `Manager` is a duplicate of the `Executor` `StatefulSet`.\r\n* Both `StatefulSet`s, the `Service`, and all `Volume Claims` which are generated for the topology are removed on termination.\r\n* `restart` will restart the `Manager` and `Executor`s for a topology.\r\n* `addContainers` will only add `Executor` containers.\r\n* `removeContainers` will only remove `Executor` containers.\r\n* `patchStatefulSetReplicas` will only patch `Executor` containers.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThe command pattern is as follows:\r\n`heron.kubernetes.manager.[limits | requests].[OPTION]=[VALUE]`\r\n\r\nThe currently supported CLI `options` are:\r\n\r\n* `cpu`\r\n* `memory`\r\n\r\n`cpu` must be natural number and `memory` must be a positive decimal indicating a value in Gigabytes.\r\n\r\n#### Example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n~/bin/heron submit
