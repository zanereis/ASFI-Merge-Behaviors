With the proposed fix at this PR:\r\nI was able to deploy a network with VXLAN.\r\n\r\nTested with the commit on top of 4.15.1.0 RC1.\r\n\r\nThis issue happened in two cases:\r\n1) deploying a new zone, where the step of creating network fails; \r\n2) creating a new network, the same workflow\r\n\r\nTested on both cases and it

Description\r\nIn ACS, there are two ways to migrate a volume between storages:\r\n- migrating only the volume (`migrateVolume`);\r\n- migrating a VM with volume (`migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume`);\r\n\r\nBoth, although are in differents flows, work similarly: they create a new volume in the destination storage and then delete the old volume in the source storage; When we delete the old volume, we also delete the volume policies (snapshot scheduling). \r\n\r\nTherefore, the new volume will not have the snapshot schedules and we will lose this information. This PR intends to copy the policies from source to destination volume before deleting the old volume;\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nIt has been tested locally in a test lab.\r\n1. I created a VM;\r\n2. I configured snapshot schedules in the volume;\r\n3. I migrated :\r\n   - volume (with `migrateVolume`);\r\n   - VM and volume (with `migrateVirtualMachineWithVolume`);\r\n4.

Description\r\n\r\n\r\nI think there is a potential securiry issuse in createUniqDir#JavaStorageLayer\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    public File createUniqDir() {\r\n        String dirName = System.getProperty(\"java.io.tmpdir\");\r\n        if (dirName != null) {\r\n            File dir = new File(dirName);\r\n            if (dir.exists()) {\r\n                String uniqDirName = dir.getAbsolutePath() + File.separator + UUID.randomUUID().toString();\r\n                if (mkdir(uniqDirName)) {\r\n                    return new File(uniqDirName);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\nSo if a user do not specify the \"java.io.tmpdir\",  we will use the default tmp dir \"/tmp\" whose mode is 777. Even users specify the \"java.io.tmpdir\", they may also forget to set the file mode as 700, hence the tmp dir is still worldreadable.  Our code then create create UniqDir  in tmp dir, and it is also worldreadable.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\ncreateUniqDir will be called by swiftUploadMetadataFile and registerTemplateOnSwift in NfsSecondaryStorageResource. Hence the MetadataFile will be written in tmp dir and is also worldreadable. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHum, assums that cloudstack runs on  a server as root, and there are also some regualr users on this  server. These regualr users (they even do not belong to cloudstack group) can read these medadatafile, which is undesirable.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI think this is similar to https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-8908 . \r\n\r\nThis PR will remind users to use correct permission for tmp dir.\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour

Description\r\nThis PR fixes #5047 which can be reproduced on Zones with _(I) Advanced Networks, (II) Security Groups enabled for the Zone, (III)  network offering without Security Groups_; for instance, `DefaultSharedNetworkOffering` which does not list Security Group as supported service.\r\n\r\nThe issue is due to the following code inside the method `VirtualMachineManagerImpl.orchestrateReboot`:\r\n[VirtualMachineManagerImpl.java#L3340](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/280c13a4bb103dd748ec304bfe0714a148c24602/engine/orchestration/src/main/java/com/cloud/vm/VirtualMachineManagerImpl.java#L3340).\r\n\r\n```\r\n  final Answer rebootAnswer = cmds.getAnswer(RebootAnswer.class);\r\n  if (rebootAnswer != null && rebootAnswer.getResult()) {\r\n      if (dc.isSecurityGroupEnabled() && vm.getType() == VirtualMachine.Type.User) {\r\n          List<Long> affectedVms = new ArrayList<Long>();\r\n          affectedVms.add(vm.getId());\r\n          _securityGroupManager.scheduleRulesetUpdateToHosts(affectedVms, true, null);\r\n      }\r\n      return;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the Data Center was deployed enabling Security group, it is expected column `is_security_group_enabled = 1`; therefore,  `dc.isSecurityGroupEnabled()` is `true`; which combined with VM of type User schedules a Ruleset update to the KVM node where the VM is being rebooted at. This particular scenario is not wanted if the VM's network has no SG.\r\n\r\nWhen testing SG for 4.15.0.0 RCs as well as testing/reviewing any PR within KVM/SG scope the tests looked good due to the fact that I was always using networks with SG.\r\n\r\nThe issue can be seen only on networks that have no SG enabled but the `dc.isSecurityGroupEnabled()` is `true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [X] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n:alert: Tests will be done soon.

Description\r\nThis PR updates the PowerFlex/ScaleIO gateway client with the following improvements.\r\n\r\n- Added connection manager to the gateway client.\r\n- Renew the client session on '401 Unauthorized' response.\r\n- Refactored the gateway client calls, for GET and POST methods.\r\n- Consume the http entity content after login/(re)authentication and close the content stream if exists.\r\n- Updated storage pool client connection timeout configuration 'storage.pool.client.timeout' to non-dynamic (It's value is picked by the ScaleIO client when it is created, which is either on the primary storage addition or management server (re)start for existing pools. In order to apply the updated config value for existing pools, it is required to restart the management server).\r\n- Added storage pool client max connections configuration 'storage.pool.client.max.connections' (default: 100) to specify the maximum connections for the ScaleIO storage pool client.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR supports ui bulk action for various resources. Following are addressed as part of this PR:\r\n- Bulk action support for various resources\r\n- Suppression of notification pop up (that appears on the top right corner of the screen) for async jobs in case the operation progress modal is open\r\n- Router links added to notification list for failed jobs/operations\r\n- Progress View - would have a filter column to filter the jobs by state\r\n- Cancel will be the default button for bulk operations\r\n- Different hue used for alert message for _destructive_ bulk operations - like delete, stop, i,e, those that could lead to a possible down-time - to indicate to the users that such actions need to be performed with caution\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!---

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #4943\r\n\r\nThis PR contains two changes\r\n(1) assign ip in new subnet as alias of guest IP in first subnet.\r\nIf there are free IPs in first subnet, cloudstack acquires a IP from them as alias, which is obviously wrong(dhcp does not work).\r\nJava code changes in this PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n(2) add missing iptables rules for port 80(apache2/metadata) and port 8080 (password server).\r\nThe rules are added in python but not applied in VR, which cause password server and metadata/userdata not work in new subnet. \r\nPython code changes in this PR fixes it.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no disk IO driver configuration for VMs running on KVM. That's OK for most the cases; however, recently there have been added some quite interesting optimizations with the IO driver `io_uring`.\r\n\r\nNote that IO URING requires:\r\n- `Qemu >= 5.0`, and\r\n- `Libvirt >= 6.3.0`.\r\n\r\nBy using `io_uring` we can see a massive I/O performance improvement within Virtual Machines running from Local and/or NFS storage.\r\n\r\nThis implementation enhances the KVM disk configuration by adding workflow for setting the disk IO drivers. Additionally, if the    Qemu and Libvirt versions matches with the required for having `io_uring` we are going to set it on the VM. If there is no support for such driver we keep it as it is nowadays, without any IO driver configured.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, our compute offerings and disk offerings are tightly coupled with respect to many aspects. For example, if a compute offering is created, a corresponding disk offering entry is also created with the same ID as the reference. Also creating compute offering takes few disk-related parameters which anyway goes to the corresponding disk offering only. I think this design was initially made to address compute offering for the root volume created from a template. Also changing the offering of a volume is tightly coupled with storage tags and has to be done in different APIs either migrateVolume or resizeVolume. Changing of disk offering should be seamless and should consider new storage tags, new size and place the volume in appropriate state as defined in disk offering.\r\n\r\nmore details are mentioned

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a Linstor volume(primary storage) cloudstack driver to cloudstack.\r\nBasic operations as creating/migrating/deleting are working.\r\nSnapshots work with Linstor for most storage pool types, but will fail because cloudstack doesn't seem to support\r\nsnapshots of RAW image types(suggestions/ideas are welcome)\r\n\r\nIt also has a commit to port elastistor jersey-client to version 2.26, so it will not collide with Linstor dependencies (I can put that in a separate PR if needed)\r\n\r\nDesign doc: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Linstor+storage+plugin\r\n\r\nFixes: #4403 \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [X] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [X] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n4 Node cloudstack

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, KVM HA implementation works only if the cluster has at least one primary storage served via NFS. This is due to the NFS heartbeat script used to check if the host is healthy. This implementation adds health checks that work regardless of a storage pool. This is done via a Java client that checks Agent status via a webserver.\r\n\r\nThe additional web-server exposes a simple JSON API that returns a list of Virtual Machines that are running on that host according to Libvirt. This way, KVM HA can verify, via Libvirt, VMs status with HTTP-call to this simple webserver and determine if the host is actually down or if it is just the Java Agent which has crashed.\r\n\r\n#### New KVM HA Helper component\r\nThe following image shows how the new KVM-HA-Helper web-service is integrated. The current NFS HeartBeat execution flow will still be used aligned with the new HA-Helper.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img width=\"460\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5025148/122809301-522bbe00-d2a4-11eb-9ebd-548d4f74b5fe.png\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n#### High Availability Workflow\r\n\r\nProposed workflow where the HA Check takes into account both **NFS Heartbeat** and the **KVM HA Helper** checks.\r\n\r\n**Note that** in order to simplify the diagram it is ignored the whole [HA state machine](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Host+HA). However, if NFS and HA Helper fails not necessarily it is going to Recover/Fence a host as depending on the HA configurations it needs to re-check some times until it reaches a threshold of accepted failures.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img width=\"400\" height=\"500\"

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is an attempt to fix the issue where vms cannot be created with solidfire root disks on vmware 6.5 and above https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/3598\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\nPreviously the approximate steps would be:\r\n\r\n1. Create snapshot of template volume\r\n2. Resignature the resulting vmfs datastore\r\n3. Expand the vmfs datastore if needed\r\n4. Rename the vmfs datastore (iscsi name with / replaced by -)\r\n5. Unmount the vmfs datastore\r\n6. Remove iscsi target (remove volume from host)\r\n\r\nSeems like previously vmware would rescan the storage and remount the datastore but newer versions do not seem to do this. \r\n\r\nWhen attempting to manually mount the datastore the following error occurs:\r\n\r\nOperation failed, diagnostics report: Unable to find volume uuid[523486b0-32e55252-da6b-0cc47a30b11e] lvm [snap-4756ea21-52348590-76c4f8d5-a176-0cc47a30b11e] devices. \r\n\r\nNote: Newer versions of vmware in addition to updating the uuid also add a label snap-snapID-oldLabel during the resignature process.\r\n\r\nIts possible the devices are being filtered for some reason and therefore not getting re-added after a rescan. https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1016222\r\n\r\n7. Start vm fails --> java.lang.RuntimeException: Datastore '-iqn.2010-01.com.solidfire:t5eb.root-150.150-0' is not accessible. No connected and accessible host is attached to this datastore.\r\n\r\nThis change modifies the steps as followings\r\n\r\n1. Create snapshot of template volume\r\n2. Resignature the resulting vmfs datastore (update the uuid since it would be identical to the template volume at creation)\r\n3. Expand the vmfs datastore if needed\r\n4. Rename the vmfs datastore (iscsi name with '/' replaced by '-')\r\n5. SKIP the step that unmounts the vmfs datastore\r\n6. SKIP the step that removes the iscsi target\r\n\r\nSome checks expect a fcd folder to be present, ADD check to ensure folder exists before testing for existence of files inside it.\r\n\r\n9. Start the vm --> this now works.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not a final solution.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\nCreate a vm with solidfire root disks on vmware 6.5 and above.\r\nExpected: Sucessful vm creation\r\nActual: fails with java.lang.RuntimeException: Datastore '-iqn.2010-01.com.solidfire:t5eb.root-150.150-0' is not accessible. No connected and accessible host is attached to this datastore.\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an explicit length to `VMInstanceVO.backupVolumes`.\r\n\r\nThe default length is 255, which caused a truncation of data if the JSON object representing the backup volumes is too big.\r\nIt caused errors when backups were made on VMs with 3 volumes or more.\r\n\r\n`vm_instance.backup_volumes` has the type TEXT, which has a maximal length of 65535 characters.\r\n\r\nFixes: #4965\r\n\r\n<!--- ********************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND

Description\r\nACS has several features that need to send email through SMTP; However the code to send emails is repeated along the features.    \r\nCode repetition does not guarantee that sending email will work the same way, makes maintenance difficult and multiplies the work to add a new option, like `StartTLS`.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to create an util to send email through SMTP, to minimize code and to facilite maintenance, unit tests creation and troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\nI configured SMTP global configs to project, alert and quota.\r\n- To quota I added 10 credits to my user and set 20 as min balance, then I called `quota update` API via

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes an NPE obtained when CloudStack cleans up templates from primary storage.\r\n\r\nTested:\r\n- Set 'storage.cleanup.interval' to a suitable low value\r\n- Create template\r\n- Deploy VM\r\n- Destroy VM\r\n- Remove template\r\n- Wait for 'storage.cleanup.interval' to be executed\r\n\r\nAs a result the template is cleanup up from primary storage, and the entry from 'template_spool_ref' is removed. However, the process throws an NPE:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2021-04-22 17:33:43,442 DEBUG [c.c.s.StorageManagerImpl] (StorageManager-Scavenger-1:ctx-56d8209b) (logid:093e5adc) Storage pool garbage collector
