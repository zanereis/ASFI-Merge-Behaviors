Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8749 Removes implicit time zone conversion to GMT when parsing dates and times from strings to objects. This addresses a latent issue in `DataTypeUtils.getDateFormat()` leading to unexpected behavior in record-oriented components and other date parsing capabilities. Removing the implicit conversion to GMT restores standard behavior where NiFi handles date parsing according to the system default time zone. This has no impact when parsing timestamps containing an explicit time zone, but addresses issues in components such as `PutDatabaseRecord` when parsing timestamps without a time zone indicator in the string.\r\n\r\nThe current Expression Language Guide indicates that both the `format` and `toDate` functions default to the local time zone when the second argument is not specified. The Record Path Guide previously indicated a default time zone of GMT for the `toDate` function, reflecting the actual behavior when support for a time zone argument was introduced. Recent updates to `PutDatabaseRecord` in NIFI-8223, released in NiFi 1.13.0, surfaced this implicit conversion issue when handling timestamp inputs from Record Readers.\r\n\r\nChanges include replacing the GMT Time Zone in `DataTypeUtils.getDateFormat()` with the explicit default of `TimeZone.getDefault()`. Additional updates include unit test adjustments in order to conform expected values to meet the corrected behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9037 Simplifies the GitHub workflow configuration for automated builds using a combination of default variables and updated actions. Multiple arguments for various commands are now defined on separate lines with the [YAML Multiline Block Chomping](https://yaml-multiline.info/) indicator for improved readability.\r\n\r\nUpdates include the following:\r\n\r\n- Created environment variables for shared Maven commands and projects\r\n- Combined multiple Maven Cache actions\r\n- Added System Information step with commands to print CPU and memory information for each platform\r\n- Added node_modules to NPM Cache action configuration\r\n- Disabled NiFi Registry integration tests in the default configuration\r\n- Removed JUnit Results artifacts from workflow\r\n- Removed parallel build argument from GitHub workflow Maven command\r\n- Upgraded Surefire Plugin to 3.0.0-M5\r\n- Upgraded Enforcer Plugin to 3.0.0\r\n- Added package-lock.json for nifi-jolt-transform-json-ui\r\n\r\nThe Ubuntu and MacOS builds use the same parameters, while the Windows build does not include the `contrib-check` or `include-grpc` profiles. The Windows build includes an additional step to get the NPM cache directory, which is not necessary on Linux or MacOS. All builds use the same list of Maven projects, which exclude the `assembly` modules for each major component.\r\n\r\nUpgrading the Maven Surefire plugin to 3.0.0-M5 supports [TCP socket communication](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SUREFIRE-1658) with forked runners, which avoids the following error observed in current actions:\r\n\r\n`Corrupted STDOUT by directly writing to native stream in forked JVM 1`\r\n\r\nWith most GitHub runners having one available core, removing argument for multi-threading Maven builds did not have a noticeable impact on performance, but it eliminated warnings due to the Apache RAT plugin not indicating support for parallel execution.\r\n\r\nRemoving the generation and storage of XML JUnit tests provide some amount of optimization over the entire job execution.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9035 Refactors `StandardTlsConfiguration.isKeystoreValid()` to avoid a `NullPointerException` when `StandardTlsConfiguration` has a `null` keystore password.  Additional updates include removal of debug logging and introduction of an internal `StoreType` used for indicating whether a file should be validated as a KeyStore or TrustStore.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

This is done by using a maven property option: -DexcludeMinifi, -DexcludeNiFiRegistry and/or -DexcludeNiFiToolkit. The absence of the property will result in default behavior, i.e. the module will be included in the build. \r\nNo unit tests are included, but separate builds were run using each of the three properties or combinations of them to verify expected behavior.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

The connection to a Vault server can be configured\r\nvia the `./conf/bootstrap-hashicorp-vault.conf` file, which comes with NiFi.\r\n\r\nAn example of creating a single secret in the correct format is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvault kv put \"nifi-kv/Context/param\" value=my-vault-value\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, `nifi-kv` would be supplied by the `vault.kv.path` property in the `bootstrap-hashicorp-vault.conf` file, \r\n`Context` is the name of a Parameter Context, and `param` is the name of the parameter whose value should be retrieved from the Vault server.\r\n\r\nThis Parameter Provider requires the following properties:\r\n\r\n| Property Name | Description | Example Value |\r\n|---------------|-------------|---------------|\r\n| nifi.stateless.parameter.provider.\\<key>.properties.vault-configuration-file | The filename of a configuration file specifying the Vault settings | ./conf/bootstrap-hashicorp-vault.conf |\r\n\r\nAn example of configuring this provider in the dataflow configuration file is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnifi.stateless.parameter.provider.Vault.name=HashiCorp Vault Provider\r\nnifi.stateless.parameter.provider.Vault.type=org.apache.nifi.stateless.parameter.HashiCorpVaultParameterValueProvider\r\nnifi.stateless.parameter.provider.Vault.properties.vault-configuration-file=./conf/bootstrap-hashicorp-vault.conf\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [x] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9008 Adds additional Jetty modules to the list of managed dependencies in the main Maven configuration.\r\n\r\nThe current configuration specifies a common version of Jetty across all components, but some components depend on additional Jetty libraries. The result of the current configuration is that extension bundles such as Solr and Hive 3 include one version of `jetty-server` and a different version of `jetty-http` or `jetty-io`. For example, `jetty-server` has version 9.4.43 and `jetty-io` may have version 9.4.20.  This update lists additional Jetty modules to ensure extension components include the same Jetty version for all dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis update also includes updates to the OWASP dependency check suppression configuration to avoid false positives related to `org.eclipse.jetty.toolchain:jetty-test-helper`, which is currently version 5.5.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8990 Upgrades direct dependencies on Groovy 2.5.4 to 2.5.14 in order to address potential vulnerabilities associated with creating temporary directories in extension methods. Additional updates include dependency management version overrides for Hive components, upgrading earlier versions of Groovy to 2.4.21, which also addresses the same potential vulnerabilities. This PR also upgrades TinkerPop Gremlin libraries from 3.3.5 to 3.5.1 in order to update transitive dependencies on Groovy.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8424 Removes class name references in `SeeAlso` annotations for `ListenFTP` and `HandleHttpResponse` to address warning log messages. `HandleHttpResponse` does not use `SSLContextService`, and links to the service documentation are already present in `ListenFTP`, so these references are not necessary. The underlying problem was the reference to Controller Service interfaces instead of implementations, but removing the references also resolves this particular issue.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

In this strategy, flowfiles are sent to the highest weighted and available relationship. Unlike 'next available', flowfiles are not distributed among all available relationships; they are sent to only one unless/until that relationship becomes unavailable. Then, it chooses the next highest weighted relationship which is available.\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8766 Implements asymmetric-key processing for internal JSON Web Token signing and verification. The changes replace the current approach based on per-user symmetric-key signing with a key rotation strategy using RSA Key Pairs. The implementation eliminates persistent storage of private key information and introduces support for JSON Web Token revocation.\r\n\r\nThe implementation leverages the latest version of Spring Security OAuth2 and Nimbus JWT for authentication and validation. Updates include a new section in the Administration Guide describing JSON Web Token processing as well as the new configuration property for controlling the key rotation period.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8956 Changes `TestListenHTTP.testSecureServerTrustStoreConfiguredClientAuthenticationRequired()` to expect an `IOException` instead of the more specific `SSLException`.\r\n\r\nAzul Zulu JDK 11.0.12 included updates to `SSLSocketImpl` that altered the behavior of TLS connection failures when the server requires client authentication. The `okhttp3.Call.execute()` method throws a checked `IOException`, so changes include updating the test method signature to match that pattern. Additional changes include removing the unnecessary conditional override of the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` security property in the test class `SslContextUtils`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8943 Corrects handling of the `NIFI_SENSITIVE_PROPS_KEY` environment variable in the Docker start script. This update changes the script behavior to check for the presence of the environment variable before replacing the value in `nifi.properties`. This approach avoids replacing the randomly generated `nifi.sensitive.props.key` when restarting a container without having specified a value for `NIFI_SENSITIVE_PROPS_KEY`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-23T13:06:36Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T11:29:28Z","closed_at":"2021-07-26T11:29:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a7d403e6be2d7fe6f4d918086ce3515ad250a94","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/88f6d3e62211e5aa12259ad1b3710ee855be9d61","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-8943","ref":"NIFI-8943","sha":"88f6d3e62211e5aa12259ad1b3710ee855be9d61","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8931 Removes One-time Password authentication and associated token REST resources.\r\n\r\nTransitioning to HTTP session cookies for passing JSON Web Tokens in #4988 eliminated the need for OTP authentication when downloading files or launching user interface extensions. Web browsers include HTTP session cookies on requests, which removes the requirement for JavaScript calls to request an access token prior to making requests.\r\n\r\nChanges include removal of the OTP authentication services as well as the `download-token` and `ui-extension-token` REST Access Resources, along with the associated JavaScript code.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-5174 Updates the project README.md to remove reference to ongoing work for compatibility with Java 11. Additional updates include removing outdated references to Git as a requirement for Bower, which is no longer used as of NIFI-2781.\r\n\r\nNiFi 1.14.0 incorporated several important improvements supporting TLS 1.3 on both Java 8 and 11, which was one of the last remaining sub-tasks listed for NIFI-5174. With JDK 11 as one of the standard automated builds, and with all the current sub-tasks closed for NIFI-5714, additional work specific to Java 11 can be handled in separate issues.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

In the current versions (1.13.2 and 1.14.0) each file is transferred to 'success' instead.**\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes bug NIFI-8924 by adding some code to 'listByNoTracking'. The same logic is used by 'listByTimeWindow' and 'listByTrackingTimestamps'. \r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7443 Corrects the behavior of SFTP processors when the `Send Keep Alive On Timeout` property is enabled. \r\n\r\nAlthough enabling `Send Keep Alive` configures a `KeepAliveProvider` for SSHJ, the internal default value for Keep Alive Interval is 0, which means that SSHJ never starts the Keep Alive Thread.\r\n\r\nSetting a value of 5 seconds for the Keep Alive Interval works together with the default Max Alive Count value of 5, resulting in a timeout of 25 seconds before the Keep Alive Runner considers the connection lost.\r\n\r\nThis behavior can be verified at runtime by setting the `net.schmizz.sshj` logger to `DEBUG` and configuring the `FetchSFTP` processor with `Send Keep Alive On Timeout` set to `true`. SSHJ logs the following message when the Keep Alive Thread is running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDEBUG [keep-alive] n.schmizz.sshj.connection.ConnectionImpl Making global request for `keepalive@openssh.com`\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8789 Corrects `TestListenUDP` to use `NetworkUtils.getAvailableUdpPort()` during setup in place of `NetworkUtils.availablePort()`, which selects an available port for TCP sockets. Additional updates include replacing the static sender port of 21001 with `NetworkUtils.getAvailableUdpPort()` as well as replacing references to `ListenRELP` with `ListenUDP`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8770 Improves response processing in `HandleHttpRequest` and refactors `rejectPendingRequests()` to `drainContainerQueue()` for handling requests in the processor's internal `BlockingQueue`.\r\n\r\nThe `rejectPendingRequests()` method used `BlockingQueue.poll()` with a timeout of two seconds and did not catch potential RuntimeExceptions while iterating over pending requests.  The new `drainContainerQueue()` method uses `BlockingQueue.drainTo()` to remove all pending requests and also uses a new `sendError()` method when attempting to send HTTP responses.\r\n\r\nIn certain scenarios, the internal `BlockingQueue` would retain pending HTTP requests in the processor even after the system stopped the processor, such as when a cluster node changed roles. This could result in `HandleHttpRequest` holding requests that would eventually produce Flow Files when a cluster node resumed primary status.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include the replacement of Guava classes with standard Java equivalents, and the introduction of standardized logging through a shared `sendError()` method.  The integration test for `HandleHttpRequest` includes a new test method to verify behavior when a cluster node is no longer the primary node and the processor was configured to run on the primary node.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8783 Moves the check for `SingleUserLoginIdentityProvider` from `setProperties()` to `initialize()` in `SingleUserAuthorizer`. This approach allows the `SingleUserAuthorizer` definition to exist in `authorizers.xml` but continues to prevent it from being used without the `SingleUserLoginIdentityProvider` being configured as the selected Login Identity Provider.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8782 Adds a new NiFi configuration property named `nifi.web.max.access.token.requests.per.second` to support rate-limiting for HTTP Access Token requests to `/nifi-api/access/token`. Leveraging the Jetty `DoSFilter`, the configuration property supports rejecting requests with HTTP 429 responses when the number of requests exceeds the configured maximum per second.\r\n\r\nThe property uses a default value of 25 requests per second, following the default value from `DoSFilter`, which should be sufficient for a reasonable number of interactive authentication attempts. This instance of the `DoSFilter` also leverages the existing configuration property that supports excluding selected remote addresses from rate-limiting.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-8768 Adds `DataTypeUtils.toLocalDate()` and updates `DataTypeUtils.convertType()` to use a new `convertTypeToDate()` method for converting input values to `java.sql.Date` when processing fields of `RecordFieldType.DATE`.  The purpose of these changes is to handle year-month-day values using local system default time zone settings instead of performing implicit conversion in some scenarios. These changes address latent issues when converting strings to `java.sql.Date` objects on systems with a time zone other than Universal Coordinated Time.  \r\n\r\nProcessors such as `PutKudu`, `PutDatabaseRecord`, and `PutElasticsearchHttpRecord` leverage Record Readers to convert information from original formats to records that NiFi uses for persisting to the destination system. For example, when configured with a `JsonTreeReader`, these processors can take a year-month-day string such as `2000-01-01` and store it using the logical `DATE` type of the destination system. When running on systems with a time zone other than UTC, these processors could result in storing a logical year-month-day of `1999-12-31` when receiving a record with a string field value of `2000-01-01`.  Pull Request #4781 for NIFI-8023 addressed this problem for `PutDatabaseRecord` using a workaround conversion method `DataTypeUtils.convertDateToLocalTZ()`. The issue was still present in `PutKudu` due to the behavior of Record Readers such as `JsonTreeReader` leveraging the String to `java.sql.Date` conversion methods in `DataTypeUtils`.\r\n\r\nThe combination of an implicit default Time Zone of GMT in `DataTypeUtils.getDateFormat()` and the absence of a declared time zone in year-month-day strings such as `2000-01-01` results in unexpected date changes when running in time zones other than UTC. This Pull Request addresses the problem by handling `RecordFieldType.DATE` and `java.sql.Types.DATE` according to the system default time zone, as implied by the use of `java.time.LocalDate` for parsing and conversion to `java.sql.Date`. This approach removes the need for the custom `DataTypeUtils.convertDateToLocalTZ()` method in `PutDatabaseRecord`.  This change applies only to `DATE` fields does not involve `TIME` or `TIMESTAMP` fields.\r\n\r\nBoth `java.time.LocalDate` and `java.sql.Date` represent a year-month-day combination without reference to a time zone, thus converting to UTC can change the day by shifting the number of hours forward or backward from the original year-month-day in the local system time zone. This Pull Request includes several additional unit test methods for both `DataTypeUtils` and referencing processors to describe and confirm expected behavior. Introduction of `DataTypeUtils.toLocalDate()` and `DataTypeUtils.convertTypeToDate()` provide methods to handle existing classes that expect `java.sql.Date` while also supporting classes that can leverage the newer `java.time.LocalDate`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
