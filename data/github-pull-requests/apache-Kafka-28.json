tickets: [KAFKA-16837](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16837), [KAFKA-16838](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16838)\r\n\r\nThis PR contains two small functional changes:\r\n\r\n1. For KAFKA-16837, the logic for comparing existing and new task configs is altered to skip config provider transformation. This should have no impact on behavior (besides fixing the bug described in the Jira ticket), since the current logic performs transformation on both sets of task configs at the same time, making it impossible to detect changes in the transformed values anyways. See [KAFKA-9228](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9228) and a couple of in-progress PRs (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16001, https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16053) for possible solutions to the problem of detecting changes in config provider values.\r\n2. For KAFKA-16838, the logic for materializing a view of the config topic is altered to ignore task configs when there is no configuration for that connector present earlier in the config topic. This handles the case where a connector has been deleted, then compaction has taken place, removing both the connector config and the subsequent tombstone message for it from the config topic.\r\n\r\nUnit testing coverage is added for both changes.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-29T14:11:23Z","updated_at":"2024-06-04T13:36:28Z","closed_at":"2024-06-04T13:36:25Z","merged_at":"2024-06-04T13:36:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"0409003c4395580b3d0b9e861e27ce61295fcdcf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ad2fe29bdb762a56fba7ceb773f57fdf9e4fc918","head":{"label":"C0urante:kafka-16837-16838","ref":"kafka-16837-16838","sha":"ad2fe29bdb762a56fba7ceb773f57fdf9e4fc918","user":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83460713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzQ2MDcxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"C0urante/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"C0urante","id":8636148,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg2MzYxNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8636148?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante","html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/C0urante/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/C0urante/kafka","description":"Mirror

testInvalidPort() test is designed to verify that the checkWithoutLookup method correctly handles invalid port numbers.  In this case, the port number \"70000\" is invalid because port numbers in TCP/IP are 16 bit so they can only range from 0 to 65535. Therefore, when the checkWithoutLookup method is called with \"localhost:70000\" as an argument, it should throw a ConfigException.  The assertThrows method is used to assert that a specific type of exception is thrown. It takes two arguments: the type of exception expected and a lambda expression that executes the code that is expected to throw the exception.  In this test, assertThrows is expected to catch a ConfigException when checkWithoutLookup(\"localhost:70000\") is called. If a ConfigException is thrown, the test passes. If not, the test fails. This ensures that the method is correctly validating port numbers and throwing an exception when an invalid port is encountered.\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-28T18:57:06Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T20:38:23Z","closed_at":"2024-05-30T20:38:23Z","merged_at":"2024-05-30T20:38:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"33a292e4dd9864bfd7142c55fc9a6e9d7f3b21e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

method `createPutCacheCallback` has a input argument [`preAppendErrors`](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/group/GroupMetadataManager.scala#L387). It is used to keep the \"error\" happens before appending. However, it is always empty. Also, the pre-append error is handled before `createPutCacheCallback` by calling [`responseCallback`](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/4f55786a8a86fe228a0b10a2f28529f5128e5d6f/core/src/main/scala/kafka/coordinator/group/GroupCoordinator.scala#L927C15-L927C84). Hence, we can remove `preAppendErrors`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

patch optimizes uniform (homogenous) assignor by avoiding creating a copy of all the assignments. Instead, the assignor creates a copy only if the assignment is updated. It is a sort of copy-on-write.

Description\r\n\r\nThis pull request improves the documentation for the `offset.lag.max` configuration in Apache Kafka's MirrorMaker. The current documentation is brief and lacks context about the role of this configuration in offset translation and potential use cases.\r\n\r\nThe updated documentation provides a more comprehensive explanation of `offset.lag.max` and its impact on the synchronization between source and remote partitions. It clarifies that `offset.lag.max` determines the maximum allowed lag between the source and remote partitions before MirrorMaker initiates a resync operation to catch up the remote partition.\r\n\r\nThe documentation also covers the following aspects:\r\n\r\n- How the lag is calculated (the difference between the latest offset in the source partition and the last committed offset in the remote partition)\r\n- The resync operation process (reading records from the source partition starting from the last committed offset in the remote partition and writing them to the remote partition)\r\n- Use cases for setting a lower `offset.lag.max` value (scenarios where records may not flow constantly or at a consistent rate, ensuring remote partitions stay more closely in sync during periods of low throughput or inactivity)\r\n- Use cases for setting a higher `offset.lag.max` value (when the source topic has high throughput and remote partitions can tolerate a larger lag)\r\n- The possibility of setting `offset.lag.max` to 0 (initiating a resync operation as soon as the remote partition falls behind the source partition, useful for strict synchronization requirements but may increase the load on the source cluster due to frequent resync operations)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [x] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [x] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [x] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n\r\nNote: The contribution is my original work and I license the work to

We do _not_ assume the leader is in the voter set and check the observer states as well.\r\n- updateLocalState now accepts an additional \"lastVoterSet\" param which allows us to update the leader state with the last known voters. any nodes in this set but not in `voterStates` will be added to `voterStates` and removed from `observerStates`, any nodes not in this set but in `voterStates` will be removed from `voterStates` and added to `observerStates`\r\n- Two tests added which check\r\n  - Removing follower from voter set will not cause HW to decrease.

uses a much simpler approach than the one pursued in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16001. Once task configs are detected for a connector, the most-recent config for that connector is tracked by the herder as the \"applied\" config. When new task configs are generated by the connector, the latest config for the connector is compared to the \"applied\" connector config. If a difference is detected, or there is no \"applied\" config, then tasks are automatically published to the config topic.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

FencedInstanceIdException that a consumer may receive in the heartbeat response. This will be the case when a static consumer is removed from the group by and admin client, and another member joins with the same group.instance.id (allowed in). The first member will receive a FencedInstanceId on its next heartbeat. The expectation is that this should be handled as a fatal error.\r\n\r\nThere are no actual changes in logic with this PR, given that without being handled, the FencedInstanceId was being treated as an \"unexpected error\", which are all treated as fatal errors, so the outcome remains the same. But we're introducing this small change just for accuracy in the logic and the logs: FencedInstanceId is expected during heartbeat, a log line is shown describing the situation and why it happened (and it's treated as a fatal error, just like it was before this PR).\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves the test to ensure that the error propagated to the app thread matches the one received in the HB.
