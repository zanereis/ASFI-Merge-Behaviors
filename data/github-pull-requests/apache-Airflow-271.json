sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3901\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-3901\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nI just added role as an optional param for snowflake hook.  Can be passed in extras.\r\n\r\n#### Note on role's optional-ness\r\nIf role is neither supplied in instantiation nor connection extras, then instance attribute `role` will get  value of `''`.  It is reasonable to ask whether this will overwrite a default role if one is set in the server.  It does not. \r\nSo if you already have a default role set up for your user in snowflake, after this change, if you still don't supply role, then you will still connect with the default role defined in the server.  The same was already true of `warehouse`.\r\nSo e.g. if you try to connect with a uri of `SOME_SCHEMA?warehouse=&role=`, then any defaults set in server will still work.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

[Airflow-3896](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3896) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nUntil v1.8.2, the [SSHExecuteOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.8.2/airflow/contrib/operators/ssh_execute_operator.py#L131) was able to log the running bash command.\r\n\r\nBut since v1.9.0, that logging code has been removed from [SSHOperator](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1.9.0/airflow/contrib/operators/ssh_operator.py).\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-15T13:31:44Z","updated_at":"2019-02-23T04:41:06Z","closed_at":"2019-02-23T04:41:06Z","merged_at":"2019-02-23T04:41:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"36b38d83e0cd409f47c057545d76d32b2a03916b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4716/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4716/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4716/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/37f06735983f0a84fa340130eebdf17eef94ea76","head":{"label":"ryanyuan:sshop-command-logging","ref":"sshop-command-logging","sha":"37f06735983f0a84fa340130eebdf17eef94ea76","user":{"login":"ryanyuan","id":7124535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQ1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7124535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":156783993,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTY3ODM5OTM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"ryanyuan/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ryanyuan","id":7124535,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQ1MzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7124535?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanyuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanyuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ryanyuan/airflow","description":"Apache

PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3887\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\ndagre-d3 v0.6.3 has a bug that causes this Javascript error when loading\r\nthe Graph View:\r\n\r\n    TypeError: previousPaths.merge is not a function\r\n\r\nThe bug fix [1] has been merged to master, but hasn't been released to\r\nnpm yet. This change temporarily downgrades our version of dagre-d3\r\nuntil dagre-d3 v0.6.4 is released [2]\r\n\r\nI also fixed a bug I encountered in the `compile_assets.sh` where the\r\nscript would fail if the directory `airflow/www/static/dist/` exists but\r\nis empty.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3/pull/350\r\n[2] https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre-d3/blob/5450627790ff42012ef50cef6b0e220199ae4fbe/package.json#L3\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-15T04:58:48Z","updated_at":"2022-09-24T22:33:54Z","closed_at":"2019-02-15T05:33:50Z","merged_at":"2019-02-15T05:33:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"72fe43b875bb8458b298c857752d14e1bd09b60e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4713/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4713/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4713/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/0d6b667ed0e3f870034c5c10bf42e47c2b5feaee","head":{"label":"lyft:astahlman/airflow-3887","ref":"astahlman/airflow-3887","sha":"0d6b667ed0e3f870034c5c10bf42e47c2b5feaee","user":{"login":"lyft","id":4269340,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQyNjkzNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4269340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft","html_url":"https://github.com/lyft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58762364,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODc2MjM2NA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"lyft/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lyft","id":4269340,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQyNjkzNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4269340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft","html_url":"https://github.com/lyft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lyft/airflow","description":"Lyft

Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\nThere's 3 commits so it's clear the passing/failing of CI status\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ X ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\nNo change in usage required\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes

Jira\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3888\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCreating a connection to a metastore with two hosts for high availability (eg connection 1, connection 2) is not possible because the entire value entered is taken. For our needs, it is necessary to go through subsequent hosts and connect to the first working.\r\n\r\nThis change allows you to check and then connect to a working metastor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nTested on two metastores, of which one was always inactive\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nmatastore1(offline); metastoer2(online).\r\nIn this case, we will connect to metastore2\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe connection is created in the webserver. We separate the metastore with a semicolon, eg: metastror1; metastore2;

directory used\r\nthroughout the code base, giving possibly conflicting answer if they\r\nweren't kept in sync:\r\n\r\n- the AIRFLOW_HOME environment variable\r\n- core/airflow_home from the config\r\n- settings.AIRFLOW_HOME\r\n- configuration.AIRFLOW_HOME\r\n\r\nSince the home directory is used to compute the default path of the\r\nconfig file to load, specifying the home directory Again in the config\r\nfile didn't make any sense to me, and I have deprecated that.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes everything in the code base use\r\n`settings.AIRFLOW_HOME` as the source of truth, and deprecates the\r\ncore/airflow_home config option.\r\n\r\n(This issue caused me a problem where the RBAC UI wouldn't work as it\r\ndidn't find the right webserver_config.py)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nExisting tests pass,.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-13T19:01:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-25T11:10:35Z","closed_at":"2019-03-25T11:10:29Z","merged_at":"2019-03-25T11:10:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"1c43cde65c5c4fc6fae943927c5d75855ad545f0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"feng-tao","id":3223098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMjMwOTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3223098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao","html_url":"https://github.com/feng-tao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/feng-tao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4705/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4705/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4705/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9ea16167a15d310be46b81277d780c80af4336bf","head":{"label":"ashb:unify_airflow_home","ref":"unify_airflow_home","sha":"9ea16167a15d310be46b81277d780c80af4336bf","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3869\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAirflowConfigParser.getboolean raises an AirflowConfigException when the value of a configuration cannot be converted to boolean. But, getint and getfloat raise a ValueError in the same case when the value cannot be casted to the desired type.\r\nThey should raise the same exception - ValueError.\r\n\r\nAlso, added tests for getboolean, getint and getfloat.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n1. test_getboolean\r\n2. test_getint\r\n3. test_getfloat\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-11T22:03:23Z","updated_at":"2019-02-12T15:08:07Z","closed_at":"2019-02-12T15:08:06Z","merged_at":"2019-02-12T15:08:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"db91909b57de9279b53d99e9c9110ed6925b0c4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4692/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4692/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4692/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b0e9063ecac1477f1acbc61e574f9102761eb2a3","head":{"label":"ttanay:airflow-3869","ref":"airflow-3869","sha":"b0e9063ecac1477f1acbc61e574f9102761eb2a3","user":{"login":"ttanay","id":26265392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY1Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26265392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay","html_url":"https://github.com/ttanay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":167679974,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjc2Nzk5NzQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"ttanay/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ttanay","id":26265392,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY1Mzky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26265392?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay","html_url":"https://github.com/ttanay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttanay/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ttanay/airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3867\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe names for packages for Azure and AWS have been standarized. Google Cloud Platform should follow this trend.\r\n\r\nIdea reported by @ashb during the discussion under PR: #4524 \r\n\r\nThis PR passed an internal review at [Polidea](https://www.polidea.com/): https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow/pull/59 \r\n\r\nCC: @kaxil, @jmcarp @potiuk It is simple, but it affects all users of GCP operators, so I'm asking for feedback. I feel obliged to inform you about this change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-11T14:58:39Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T14:21:58Z","closed_at":"2019-02-27T14:21:58Z","merged_at":"2019-02-27T14:21:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"a84fb73627948cf3147aa8b9dae2703b8c389d48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/09212ad298884aeb8dfb39b44a8630919f44e0f4","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:subpackage-gcp","ref":"subpackage-gcp","sha":"09212ad298884aeb8dfb39b44a8630919f44e0f4","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

I often receive questions about it, and it helps to know what component (scheduler/worker) is responsible for what stage of a task.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/52532823-f099d300-2d2a-11e9-8361-4c27eed6fea4.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nno tests needed\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-10T10:56:18Z","updated_at":"2019-02-11T11:28:27Z","closed_at":"2019-02-11T11:28:27Z","merged_at":"2019-02-11T11:28:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"f4374eda3e270367cbdd70ede248a6b1b1a8d23b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/64b31f8e2d4501a98042bcec63fce2e1e8f88ed5","head":{"label":"BasPH:bash-fix-docs","ref":"bash-fix-docs","sha":"64b31f8e2d4501a98042bcec63fce2e1e8f88ed5","user":{"login":"BasPH","id":6249654,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDk2NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6249654?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH","html_url":"https://github.com/BasPH","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BasPH/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d11147ad65c8a1d93f9371d484f9cc01938dc75f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [AIRFLOW-3857](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3857) issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] The spark_submit_hook.on_kill method cannot kill a kubernetes driver pod because of an issue in the client used. The client used in 1.10.{0,1,2} is in fact the CoreV1Api instead of the kubernetes client which has the proper V1DeleteOptions value needed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] No test was done on this part, I added a test, but it's not perfect it only mocks the kubernetes client and check the parameters which definitely fails with the last code so... in terms of TDD it works, but it's only a mock call parameter check.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] No new feature, just a bug fix\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3853) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3853\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3853\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] We've recently started to see duplicate logs in S3. After digging into it, we discovered that this was due to our use of the new `reschedule` mode on our sensors. Because the same `try_number` is used when a task reschedules, the local log file frequently contains results from previous attempts. Additionally, because the `s3_task_helper.py` always tries to `append` the local log file to the remove log file, this can result in massive logs (we found one that 400 mb).\r\n\r\nTo fix this, we'd like to remove the local log after a successful upload. Because the file is uploaded to S3, no data will be lost.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: I've modified the following unit tests to cover the change to `s3_write`: `test_write`, `test_write_existing`, `test_write_raises`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-08T22:15:38Z","updated_at":"2020-06-17T15:22:11Z","closed_at":"2019-09-11T15:27:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f2d96fbd7fbb40ba72fcaf917b91835fbab0f98e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

for a fallback kwarg was added in `AirflowConfigParser.get`\r\nin [AIRFLOW-3742], but, `AirflowConfigParser.getboolean` also needs\r\nto support it.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3852\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nOn the latest master, when I ran `airflow worker`, I got the following error:\r\n```\r\n[2019-02-09 00:12:25,983] {__init__.py:51} INFO - Using executor SequentialExecutor\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nFile \"/home/tanay/Coding/airflow/.env/bin/airflow\", line 6, in <module>\r\nexec(compile(open(__file__).read(), __file__, 'exec'))\r\nFile \"/home/tanay/Coding/airflow/airflow/bin/airflow\", line 32, in <module>\r\nargs.func(args)\r\nFile \"/home/tanay/Coding/airflow/airflow/utils/cli.py\", line 74, in wrapper\r\nreturn f(*args, **kwargs)\r\nFile \"/home/tanay/Coding/airflow/airflow/bin/cli.py\", line 1058, in worker\r\nif not settings.validate_session():\r\nFile \"/home/tanay/Coding/airflow/airflow/settings.py\", line 226, in validate_session\r\nworker_precheck = conf.getboolean('core', 'worker_precheck', fallback=False)\r\nTypeError: getboolean() got an unexpected keyword argument 'fallback'\r\n```\r\nSupport for a `fallback` kwarg in `AirflowConfigParser.get` was added by @ashb in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/4567.\r\nSupport for it also needs to be in `AirflowConfigParser.getboolean`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNot Needed.\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

provider. Examples should not be included there. I'm moving example to another place. This is not the best place. Such things should be in the `howto/operator.rst` file, but this would require writing a lot more documentation.  Other operators have examples in the class description, so this is not an invalid change. Step by step.  Cleaning `integration.rst` file is the first goal.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3826\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is the second attempt to clean up in Airflow.  The first attempt was made by @kaxil, but was delayed until the release of Airflow 2.0. @kaxil  solution was not backward compatible.\r\nSee: #3000 \r\n\r\nMy solution is backwards compatible. The user can use old and new paths at the same time.\r\nIn the future, support for old paths may be abandoned.\r\n\r\nThis is not the last version of the patch. For example: this fix requires `UPDATING.md` to be completed, but I would like to hear your feedback.\r\n\r\nIt is worth mentioning that IDE have support for notifications for the developer. The message will not be displayed only at runtime, but also when writing.\r\n\r\n![screenshot 2019-02-07 at 21 36 22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12058428/52441460-e906de00-2b20-11e9-816e-23b070ce1af7.png)\r\n\r\nOn this PR, please look and think about the whole platform, not as a single and simple PRs. In the future, further improvements can be made for other areas in a similar way. This solution also applies to the operators and sensors for the Google Cloud Platform.\r\n\r\nAnother solution is to create sub-modules.\r\nThe directory structure would then look that way.\r\n````\r\n+ airflow\r\n+---+ contrib\r\n|   +---+ sensors\r\n|   |   +--- __init__.py\r\n|   |   +--- gcp_transfer_operator.py\r\n|   |   +--- gcp_sql_operator.py\r\n|   |   +--- sagemaker_base_operator.py\r\n|   |   +--- sagemaker_endpoint_config_operator.py\r\n|   |   +--- sagemaker_endpoint_operator.py\r\n|   |   +--- sagemaker_model_operator.py\r\n|   |   +--- sagemaker_training_operator.py\r\n|   |   +--- sagemaker_transform_operator.py\r\n|   |   +--- sagemaker_tuning_operator.py\r\n|   |   +--+ sagemaker_operator\r\n|   |      +--- __init__.py\r\n|   |      +--- base_operator.py\r\n|   |      +--- endpoint_config_operator.py\r\n|   |      +--- endpoint_operator.py\r\n|   |      +--- model_operator.py\r\n|   |      +--- training_operator.py\r\n|   |      +--- transform_operator.py\r\n|   |      +--- tuning_operator.py\r\n|   +---- operators\r\n````\r\nWith this structure, new and old imports  continued to work\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.contrib.operators.sagemaker_operator import SageMakerEndpointOperator\r\nfrom airflow.contrib.operators.sagemaker_endpoint_operator import SageMakerEndpointOperator\r\n```\r\nAfter the transition period, we can delete the `sagemaker_*. py` files and then only new import path will work.\r\n\r\nCC: @criccomini, @fenglu-g, @ashb \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nNo applicable\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation updated\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n> - [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3822\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n> - [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCorrecting a behavior observed with the KubernetesExecutor + KubernetesPodOperator where a timeout kills the pod watcher but not the pod running the actual work.\r\n\r\n* I added an on_kill hook which removes the pod when the watcher pod is terminated.\r\n* I changed `pod` to `self.pod` in order to reference it in the `on_kill` function\r\n* I removed the general catch AirflowException, because the logging message was not bringing debugging insight and it was upcasting a TimeoutException which was preventing the on_kill hook to be triggered\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n> - [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nIn order for a test to make sense it would need to run from within a Kubernetes cluster; I have tried building on top of the Docker image given in Contributing, adding postgres resources to be launched in a local kubernetes cluster, mounting the Airflow repo as a hostVolume, running `pip install -e` but the started KubernetesPods also needs a built image in order to run so I hit a wall there. (But even before hitting that wall I had created quite a big README at that point already)\r\n\r\nMaybe we can have a chat on how to test this properly, I didn't see any test in the codebase using `in_cluster=True` so far.\r\n\r\nHere's what I have attempted to do https://github.com/dmateusp/incubator-airflow/tree/AIRFLOW-3822_test\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n> - [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n> - [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\nCorrects a bug rather than creating a new feature\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n> - [X] Passes

and requests\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3819\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently the kubernetes executor allows you to specify pod resources requests and limits (cpu and memory). For example:\r\n```\r\n# Limit resources on this operator/task with node affinity & tolerations\r\nthree_task = PythonOperator(\r\n    task_id=\"three_task\", python_callable=print_stuff, dag=dag,\r\n    executor_config={\r\n        \"KubernetesExecutor\": {\"request_memory\": \"128Mi\",\r\n                               \"limit_memory\": \"128Mi\",\r\n                               \"tolerations\": tolerations,\r\n                               \"affinity\": affinity}}\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThese values are used by kubernetes when making scaling decisions. This PR allows you to specify a global default for these values, to ensure that each pod airflow creates has a value specified for these properties.\r\nYou are still able to modify these values on a dag by dag basis. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThere are currently no tests around configuring resources limits/request values as used in the example above, and these would be non-trivial to add due to the integration with kube_client. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n\r\n`default_airflow.cfg`

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3813\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nHere is the help text of the new command `airflow roles`:\r\n\r\n    usage: airflow roles [-h] [-c] [-d] [-l] [role [role ...]]\r\n\r\n    positional arguments:\r\n      role          The name of a role\r\n\r\n    optional arguments:\r\n      -h, --help    show this help message and exit\r\n      -c, --create  Create a new role\r\n      -d, --delete  Delete an existing role\r\n      -l, --list    List roles\r\n\r\nCreate and delete are both reentrant, i.e., `create` only adds a new\r\nrole if it does not exist, and `delete` only removes roles that do\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests for creating, deleting, and listing roles in tests/core.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ X ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-06T20:04:14Z","updated_at":"2022-09-24T22:33:49Z","closed_at":"2019-02-07T04:34:51Z","merged_at":"2019-02-07T04:34:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"2dadee7a248442012e835eeaad3f21f698d0642b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4658/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4658/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4658/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c11ce552e50cc691d741e2812962ba377ee0d9f1","head":{"label":"lyft:astahlman/airflow-3813","ref":"astahlman/airflow-3813","sha":"c11ce552e50cc691d741e2812962ba377ee0d9f1","user":{"login":"lyft","id":4269340,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQyNjkzNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4269340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft","html_url":"https://github.com/lyft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":58762364,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1ODc2MjM2NA==","name":"airflow","full_name":"lyft/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lyft","id":4269340,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQyNjkzNDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4269340?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft","html_url":"https://github.com/lyft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lyft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lyft/airflow","description":"Lyft

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3807\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nNote: For the highlighting to work it is required that the **labels matches the actual css classes** that give the tasks its colors. An exception is the `null` state (`None` state in python). If a tasks state is `null` in js it will add the `no_status` css class to this node.\r\n\r\nMain Changes:\r\n- fixes \"up_for_retry\" and \"up_for_reschedule\" tasks when hovering over \"retry\"/\"rescheduled\" task state\r\n- fixes \"null\" status when hovering over \"no status\" task state\r\n- adds missing task states to stateFocusMap that will be used for highlighting tasks when clicking on task state\r\n- updates Tree View task status labels to be the same as in the Graph View\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n![2019-02-12 18 21 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23282078/52655484-8a60ac00-2ef4-11e9-80ce-7431e3a043f0.gif)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n![2019-02-12 18 12 11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23282078/52655493-90568d00-2ef4-11e9-8def-85afbde5e2d3.gif)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3274\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAt this time it is not possible to add `run_as_user` or `fs_group` securityContext options to worker pods when using KubernetesExecutor. This makes it harder to use KubernetesExecutor on clusters with pod security policies which do not allow containers to run as root.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `run_as_user` and `fs_group` options to Airflow in order to set these security context options on worker pods spawned by KubernetesExecutor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- `test_security_context` in `tests/contrib/minikube/test_kubernetes_pod_operator.py`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

sure you have checked all steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3780\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe found that after set the base_url, some of the aiflow pages cannot be redirected  to correct path. The pages include:\r\n* Task instances in the dag detail page\r\n* The schedule interval tag in the dag detail page\r\n* Trigger button in the dag list page\r\n\r\nIn the first two pages, the root cause is the path is hard coded. In the PR, I change them to {{ url_for( ... ) }} to use the path generated by backend.\r\n\r\nIn the third one, the root cause is that the 'origin' param is not passed to the backend correctly. I added a javascript function to add the origin param to the url.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI don't know how to do test on UI link change\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2694\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for declaratively assigning DAG-level permissions\r\nto a role via the `DAG.__init__()` method.\r\n\r\nWhen the DAG definition is evaluated and the `access_control` argument\r\nis supplied, we update the permissions on the ViewMenu associated with\r\nthis DAG according to the following rules:\r\n\r\n- If the role does not exist, we raise an exception.\r\n- If the role exists, we ensure that it has the specified set of\r\n  permissions on the DAG\r\n- If any other permissions exist for the DAG that are not specified in\r\n  `access_control`, we revoke them\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests in `tests/models.py` to test that:\r\n\r\n- Invalid roles raise an exception\r\n- Invalid permissions raise an exception\r\n- New permissions in the access_control map are created\r\n- Existing permissions that are not specified in the access_control map are revoked\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ X ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ X ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\nNot sure if we have any docs that need updating besides the docstrings on the DAG class. If so, let me know and I'll be happy to update those, as well.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ X ] Passes

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3795\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nFor a `PythonOperator`, I can set `provide_context=True`. For a `PythonVirtualenvOperator`, I am not able to set `provide_context=True`, and `provide_context=False` gets passed to the super function. I do not see why this is hardcoded, and I would like to be able to use the context with a `PythonVirtualenvOperator`.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/83cb9c3acdd3b4eeadf1cab3cb45d644c3e9ede0/airflow/operators/python_operator.py#L242\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n(I'll wait to see if it passes on Travis since this is a small change)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n###

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3737\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nKubernetes has a 63char limit on label values, so when running either a\r\nsubdag or a dag with a name with a length longer than 63 chars, the pod\r\ncreation process will fail with the following error:\r\n\r\n  [2019-01-21 08:07:05,337] {rest.py:219} DEBUG - response body:\r\n  {\"kind\":\"Status\",\"apiVersion\":\"v1\",\"metadata\":{},\"status\":\"Failure\",\"message\":\"unable\r\n  to parse requirement: invalid label value:\r\n  \\\"very_long_dag_name.very_long_task_name\\\": must be no more than 63\r\n  characters\",\"reason\":\"BadRequest\",\"code\":400}\r\n\r\nAnnotations however, allow for a relatively unrestricted length when\r\nstoring them against pods, and as such would be better suited in this\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nThis pull request fixes a bug in `KubernetesJobWatcher`, which doesn't yet have any tests\r\n(it is patched out in tests of the `KubernetesExecutor`).  It isn't straightforward to add meaningful\r\ntests to the `KubernetesJobWatcher` due to its integration with `kube_client`. We could pass in\r\na mock, but we don't think this would actually achieve anything and could actually create difficulties\r\nin the future as we would be making assumptions on how to code works, instead on what the code\r\ndoes. This is really crying out for an integration test, but we believe that is outside the scope of this\r\npull request. We're happy to take advice from the community on this \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n  - All the public functions and the classes in the PR contain docstrings that explain what it does\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`","created_at":"2019-01-31T15:39:20Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T23:51:31Z","closed_at":"2019-03-22T15:24:56Z","merged_at":"2019-03-22T15:24:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"e8c395093d06946d1be5ee072116bc2994dad0a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4636/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4636/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4636/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/fa7abdf7d0703cd35a0225539899704d4f79a7dd","head":{"label":"autotraderuk:AIRFLOW-3737","ref":"AIRFLOW-3737","sha":"fa7abdf7d0703cd35a0225539899704d4f79a7dd","user":{"login":"autotraderuk","id":6122095,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxMjIwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6122095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk","html_url":"https://github.com/autotraderuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":167154313,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjcxNTQzMTM=","name":"airflow","full_name":"autotraderuk/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"autotraderuk","id":6122095,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjYxMjIwOTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6122095?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk","html_url":"https://github.com/autotraderuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/autotraderuk/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/autotraderuk/airflow","description":"Apache

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug [AIRFLOW-3792](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3792) in BigQuery Hook when using : \r\n- useLegacySQL to False\r\n- or queryParameters, because since 1.10 the queryParameters were validated as dict instead of what google's API expects (a list of dict)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests : in `contrib/test_bigquery_hook.py` a test called `test_run_query_sql_dialect_legacy_with_query_params` which tests both the proper form of query params and the legacy sql flag set to False in conjonction.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n- [x] No new thing, just a bug
