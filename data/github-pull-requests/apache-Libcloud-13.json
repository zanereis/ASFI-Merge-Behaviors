ticket in the JIRA issue tracker: [LIBCLOUD-749](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-749)\n\nThis PR fixes the following bugs:\n- The docstring doesn't match parameters of the method.\n- Only `ICMP` and `TCP` is allowed even if the doc of the parameter `protocol` mention `TCP` and `UDP`.\n- Moreover `ICMP` cannot be used because there is no way to specify the two required parameters `icmptype` and `icmpcode`.\n- The parameter `endport` is not used if it's defined.\n- The return type is not a `list` but a `dict`.\n- The unit test doesn't use parameters in the correct order.\n\nThis PR also does the following changes:\n- Improve the docstring to be a bit more detailed (the previous one comes from the official Apache CloudStack documentation).\n- Add a `kwargs` to allow to provide extra parameters defined in the API and in the docstring.\n- Improve the unit test.\n- Add support for other protocols like `AH`, `GRE` and `ESP` which are available on some Cloud like Exoscale.\n","created_at":"2015-09-15T21:53:28Z","updated_at":"2015-10-11T14:10:13Z","closed_at":"2015-10-11T14:10:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69d18cec2690e7d1a99755957a4bc5eaf9dd4d55","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/580/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/580/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/580/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/57a8733b27bb3d403b101b5b417ce22103e22d39","head":{"label":"schaubl:LIBCLOUD-749_cloudstack-fixed-ex_authorize_security_group_ingress","ref":"LIBCLOUD-749_cloudstack-fixed-ex_authorize_security_group_ingress","sha":"57a8733b27bb3d403b101b5b417ce22103e22d39","user":{"login":"schaubl","id":2462866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2462866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl","html_url":"https://github.com/schaubl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":12724950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjcyNDk1MA==","name":"libcloud","full_name":"schaubl/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"schaubl","id":2462866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2462866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl","html_url":"https://github.com/schaubl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/schaubl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/schaubl/libcloud","description":"Mirror

have a use case that requires explicitly setting the proxy_url for accessing a vCloud API (as opposed to the default environment proxy). I noticed that the proxy_url was not being passed to the base Connection class by the base NodeDriver. I fixed this by adding the proxy_url into the constructor call where the connection class is created.\n\nAlso, within the vCouldNodeDriver a new connection class we being created with\nno custom variables rather than re-using the existing connection class. Any custom values, such as the proxy_url, were not being passed to this new instance. By swapping to the self.connection class these variables are set.\n\nI could not find any unit tests that would demonstrate this issue (I would assume that they would be integration tests anyway). So apologies that this fix does not have supporting tests.\n","created_at":"2015-09-14T01:08:42Z","updated_at":"2015-09-25T11:22:59Z","closed_at":"2015-09-25T11:13:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eb5a16b199dcc6e4fa75dd18770005a4fa709a67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/578/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/578/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/578/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/1f7f750ecba001c36bb941eba969a58a1773dbe4","head":{"label":"MrBasset:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"1f7f750ecba001c36bb941eba969a58a1773dbe4","user":{"login":"MrBasset","id":3640321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3640321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset","html_url":"https://github.com/MrBasset","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42418195,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjQxODE5NQ==","name":"libcloud","full_name":"MrBasset/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MrBasset","id":3640321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NDAzMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3640321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset","html_url":"https://github.com/MrBasset","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MrBasset/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MrBasset/libcloud","description":"Apache

authentication will fail if your time drift (difference between your local time and time on google servers) is bigger than 5 minutes. This often happens on the VM instances running in various cloud providers. Google itself doesn't provide any helpful indication of the issue, the response is just `{u'error': u'invalid_grant'}`.\n\nThere is also problem in the `_get_error(self, body)`, line 205: the error response returned by google above will mean that err is a string, not a dictionary. `err.get` will then throw attribute error, which displays generic error message. I think it is better to display the generic error message than not so helpful 'invalid_grant' response from google. You might decide to fix or change that later, but for now I think it's important to hint about time drift to the user, as this happens quite often and it's hard to find, if you only check whether your credentials are correct (which they can be, but you'll still fail auth with big time drift).\n","created_at":"2015-09-02T11:12:37Z","updated_at":"2015-09-25T11:39:39Z","closed_at":"2015-09-25T11:38:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"de2516848027e06d53e4d3a589a18464acc6a56a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/571/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/571/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/571/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/06ad52efeb7ddf512f499a47eeabab9137b37bfb","head":{"label":"mtekel:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"06ad52efeb7ddf512f499a47eeabab9137b37bfb","user":{"login":"mtekel","id":483891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mzg5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/483891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel","html_url":"https://github.com/mtekel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41796373,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTc5NjM3Mw==","name":"libcloud","full_name":"mtekel/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mtekel","id":483891,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4Mzg5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/483891?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel","html_url":"https://github.com/mtekel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mtekel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mtekel/libcloud","description":"Apache

far my knowledge is concerned it is impossible to reach the else part of the whole next_hop in a sensible way.\nFor example (commented):\n\n```\n        if next_hop is None:\n            url = 'https://www.googleapis.com/compute/%s/projects/%s/%s' % (\n                  API_VERSION, self.project,\n                  \"global/gateways/default-internet-gateway\")\n

object that evaluates to a node name in a string context but it failed on finding proper zone `_find_zone_or_region` because `name` param is a string explicitly needed here `if res['name'] == name:`. When change to `str(name)` worked properly.\n\nIn my opinion more sensible choice would be to assume that when `next_hop` is not a string it is a `Node` object and it can be achieved with deleting just one line and changing `node` to `next_hop`.\n","created_at":"2015-07-22T10:45:56Z","updated_at":"2015-09-29T20:40:51Z","closed_at":"2015-09-29T20:40:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58da9d1564154e186f9ccba963c9cc64c92e62f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/552/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/552/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/552/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/d6be24b6ff37a3b5ff8aa8c13254cebde6c0a629","head":{"label":"marcinzaremba:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"d6be24b6ff37a3b5ff8aa8c13254cebde6c0a629","user":{"login":"marcinzaremba","id":3660963,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2NjA5NjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3660963?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba","html_url":"https://github.com/marcinzaremba","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcinzaremba/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"79680b56ebf9f0db9910c1dadf6a831cd43a3e23","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":419555,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTk1NTU=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"apache/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/libcloud","description":"Apache

methods to create and destroy storage services in Azure and the appropriate tests. I believe this is necessary because when you use the create_node method to create a node, it will automatically create a storage service, and when you call destroy_node, it does not delete that storage service. Consequently, you must use another tool or the GUI to clean up after node creation (or to set up for it), so providing this functionality through libcloud enhances the role libcloud can play in Azure usage. Also, I think these methods belong in the compute driver rather than in the storage driver for two reasons:\n1) These are higher level functions than is accessible through the current Azure storage

pull request adds support for pickling Driver instances (e.g. `NodeDriver`) and support for pickling other Libcloud objects which hold reference to the driver instance (e.g. `Node`, `DNSRecord`, etc.).\n\nPickling doesn't work out of the box for NodeDriver and other objects since a driver contains a reference to the `Connection` class instance which contains many unpicklable types.\n\nTo work around this limitation, we don't pickle the `Connection` class instance, but we just pickle arguments which are needed to re-build / re-create the Connection instance and we re-create the instance when unpickling the object.\n","created_at":"2015-07-19T12:10:07Z","updated_at":"2016-02-14T11:40:23Z","closed_at":"2016-02-14T11:40:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0af5cfa3775628ef301bccda90bd20962229004","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/549/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/549/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/549/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/e9a2e6db29a4a3dcc719a9ebcea0582ed7931dcb","head":{"label":"Kami:support_for_pickling_driver_instances","ref":"support_for_pickling_driver_instances","sha":"e9a2e6db29a4a3dcc719a9ebcea0582ed7931dcb","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache
