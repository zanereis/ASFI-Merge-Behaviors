Introduce a convenience method to the libcloud module for getting drivers\n### Description\n\nI find the current mechanism for fetching drivers a little cumbersome, 2 namespaces to import. After using the `requests` library I really like the module `__init__` accessors for common attributes. The most common factory is `get_driver` and the most common enum is the Provider enum.\n\nThis code allows for this example:\n\n``` python\nimport libcloud\ncls = libcloud.get_driver(libcloud.DriverType.COMPUTE, libcloud.DriverType.COMPUTE.RACKSPACE)\n```\n### Status\n- done, ready for review\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [x] [Code

[GCE] Improve performance of list nodes by caching volume information\n### Description\n\nWhen listing nodes, the GCE driver currently calls the disk API for each disk attached to the node.  This PR changes that behavior by using the aggregatedLIst call for disks (once per list_node request) and using that information to provide disk details.\n\nSee sample performance info in [LIBCLOUD-826](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LIBCLOUD-826)\n#### Implementation:\n\nFor disk information, aggregated calls are now always used and the disk information is stored in a dictionary, called 'volume_dict'.  If the user would like the most current information, they may set the use_cache keyword to false and the call (and subsequent population of volume_dict) will be made prior to returning disk information.\n\nCode was added/changed in two classes.  In GCENodeDriver, added two methods and an additional parameter to build, lookup and toggle the refresh of the volume cache.   In GCEConnection, added convenience and helper methods to the class, which not only support this performance improvement but also support the longer term vision of leveraging aggregatedList calls elsewhere.\n##### GCEConnection\n- _(new method)_ **def request_aggregated_items(self, api_name)** - make all necessary calls, handling maxresults and saving the 'items' portion of the response.\n- _(new method)_ **def _merge_response_items(self, list_name, response_list)** - helper method to merge responses into a single dictionary\n##### GCENodeDriver\n- _(new member)_ **volume_dict** - dictionary organized by name, zone.  Name is always available to us, but is not unique across zones.  Zones, though, are optionally supplied.  By organizing by name, we remove the need to search through the entire list of disks each time and can do a single hash lookup to have access to all disks by that name.  If we have the zone, another hash lookup, if not, we take the first key alphabetically.\n- _(new method)_ **_build_name_zone_dict(self, zone_dict)** - internal method to populate volume dict\n- _(new method)_ **_ex_populate_volume_dict(self)** - Void method to call API and build volume dictionary\n- _(new method)_ **_ex_lookup_volume(self, name, zone=None)** - implements the actual lookup.  If zone is not provided, take the disk with that name from the (alphabetical) first zone (this is only an issue if there are more than two disks with the same name).\n- _(new parameter)_ **list_nodes(self, ex_zone=None, use_disk_cache=True)** - use_disk_cache parameter for list_nodes to pass through, defaults to True.  If set to true, no more than one call per 500 disks would be made to populate all disk info for nodes\n- _(new parameter, revision)_ **ex_get_volume(self, name, zone=None, use_cache=False)** - revised to check if volume_dict has been populated or should be used, followed by returning the call to _ex_lookup_volume\n### Status\n- done, ready for review\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n-

change will add certifi CA bundle path to Libcloud CA bundle search path if `certifi` library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/certifi) is installed and available in the virtual environment / PYTHONPATH where Libcloud is used.\n\nThis path is injected into the CA bundle search path which means it has precedence over other paths.\n\nThis behavior is enabled by default, but it can be disabled by setting `LIBCLOUD_SSL_USE_CERTIFI` environment variable to `false` or any other non-truthy value.\n\nSome context can be found in this PR - https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/694, but even without it, I think that's a good change until we switch to `requests`.\n## TODO\n- [ ]

Implement block storage APIs for DigitalOcean\n### Description\n\nDigitalOcean has a new block storage feature in beta. The API docs are [available here](https://developers.digitalocean.com/documentation/v2/block-storage-beta/). This PR implements the block storage API calls in the DigitalOcean driver.\n\nA few things to keep in mind at this point:\n- Block storage is currently only available to users enrolled in the beta. Block storage API calls will fail for other users.\n- Block storage is not yet available in all DigitalOcean regions.\n- DigitalOcean block storage does not support snapshots, so snapshot-related APIs are still unimplemented.\n### Status\n\nDone, ready for review.\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\n- [x] Documentation\n- [x] [Tests](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/testing.html)\n- [ ] [ICLA](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#contributing-bigger-changes) (required for bigger

Add support for creating multiple nodes on a subnetwork\n### Description\n\nCurrently for GCE, the multi node creation API does not support creating multiple nodes on a subnetwork. I have made changes to the ex_create_multiple_nodes function and the functions it calls to support creation of nodes on a given subnetwork. If subnetwork is None, the changes fall back to legacy network behavior on GCE so it is backwards compatible. There was one change to _create_node_req that was needed to get disk types which is simply passing in the location provided as an argument to ex_get_disktype.\n### Status\n- ready for review\n###

Updated create_volume routine in the cloudstack.py file to support ex_volume_type\n### Description\n\nAs part of the deployment of an internal cloud using CloudStack, we discovered that\none cannot use the \"DiskOffering\" capability of CloudStack to select volumes with\nspecific attributes. When reviewing the OpenStack portion of the library, this is\nsupported using the ex_volume_type variable in the call to create_volume.\n\nThe CloudStack DiskOffering capability is required for this deployment, so the create_volume\nrouting in cloudstack.py was updated to add this as an option using the same variable name\nas used for OpenStack.\n\nWhen a DiskOffering is specified, the input size to create_volume is over-riden by the \nsize of the DiskOffering, unless the DiskOffering size is customizable. This was chosen\nto minimize errors, as if someone calls create_volume with the ex_volume_type option,\nthen it is likely that is what they want, even if the specified size is different from the request.\n### Status\n- done, ready for review\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide)

[google compute] Preliminary support for GCE beta API\n### Description\n\nGoogle Compute Engine serves both a 'v1' and 'beta' API. Over time the 'beta' API will be promoted to 'v2'. New GCE features that are additive and backwards compatible are added to 'v1'. But some features are only surfaced in 'beta'.\n\nThis PR is the start of building in support for GCE users to specify which version of the API to use. The provided `demos/gce_demo.py` script has been tested against the 'beta' API and works as expected. However, unittest fixtures are heavily tied to 'v1' and will require more work to create a more robust 'v1' and 'beta' set of tests. For the time being, this PR provides the basics for adding new `test_beta_` methods, but otherwise assumes the use of 'v1'.\n\nFollow up PRs will begin addressing support for both API versions.\n###

Adding support subnetworks to GCE driver\n### Description\n\nThis PR adds support Google Compute Engine's subnetworks feature[1].  When this feature was introduced, Google suggested users begin using automatically allocated regional subnetworks versus a single global network. The GCE driver predates subnetworks, so the default is still set to create **legacy** networks, even though this is no longer recommended.\n\nSubnetworks are a necessary prerequisite for other GCE networking features that will be added to libcloud shortly.\n\n[1] https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/subnetworks\n### Status\n\nI intend to leave this PR open for community review for 7 days and

Support for Google Compute Engine Image Families\n### Description\n\nGoogle Compute Engine has a new feature that allows one to specify an image using a \"family\". This will return the latest, non-deprecated image that has been created in the given project with that family attribute. This change adds support for using an image family in create_node and create_volume as well as a new method ex_get_image_from_family that will return an image resource from a family name.\n###

pull request works on the great initial work and idea from @Jc2k (#211).\n## Background\n\nI've talked with @tonybaloney the other day on how we could make the library better and more user-friendly. Usually the biggest problem and \"unfriendliness\" is when the driver doesn't fully comply to the base API. From a high level perspective those small things (e.g. argument is missing an `ex_` prefix, etc.) don't seen like a big deal, but they actually are (death by the thousand cuts).\n\nThis causes problems because it makes building truly provider agnostic applications harder and means that user needs to build another layer on top of Libcloud which handles those differences and this makes the library less attracting (hey, Libcloud is supposed to abstract those differences away!).\n\nAs of now, we do this \"compliance against the base / standard API\" checking manually during code reviews. Obviously manual process is error prone and wastes a tons of time which could be spend on reviewing things which actually add value.\n\nI think the first step for improving the quality is having a

Fix libcloud + lxml tests under Python 2.x (ex. vcloud)\n### Description\n\nTravis will hopefully confirm this improves the Python 2.x lxml tests from:\n`FAILED (failures=1, errors=52, skipped=14)`\nTo:\n`FAILED (failures=1, errors=9, skipped=14)`\n\nI spent an hour trying to understand VCloud's XML builder but it's just a bit complicated for me at this time, which is all that's left to fix under Python 2.7 for me at least. If I can make time to figure it out I'll create another PR.\n#### Context\n\nHopefully #769 gets a better chance of going through or getting some feedback so Mathspace isn't forced to switch to boto3, this being our third cloud provider in the last year (long story) which theoretically at least makes sticking with libcloud very attractive as long as we can get it working under Python 3, preferably without forking it.\n### Status\n- done, ready for review\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [ ] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\n- [ ] Documentation\n- [ ]

PY3: Reduce AWS S3 test errors if lxml is present\n### Description\n\nThis fixes the AWS S3 `driver.list_containers()` error described in #762 and #767, among others, e.g. \n\n```\n# Now passes completely if lxml is present\n$ PYTHONPATH=. python libcloud/test/storage/test_s3.py\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 192 tests in 0.480s\n\nOK\n```\n\nAt least lxml should raise `ValueError` pretty quickly if `Response.body` is a `str` type, and it was almost certainly assumed to be `'utf-8'`, this being the web, so we'll pay the price of the decode & encode on the production happy path to get a probable overall speedup from lxml. http://lxml.de/performance.html\n\nSeems cleaner than alternate approaches like trying to inject an additional `Response.content` attribute to work with the Python 3 bytes type or changing the `response.body` to a `bytes` type (causes thousands of JSON tests to break). e.g. See https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/767\n\nI don't have an aliyun.py, etc driver to test against so don't feel comfortable changing that though happy for others to do so.\n\nIn my local Python 3.5+lxml virtualenv, running \"python setup.py test\", which hopefully Travis will confirm:\n\n```\nBEFORE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 5439 tests in 24.415s\n\nFAILED (failures=4, errors=595, skipped=14)\n\nAFTER\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 5439 tests in 27.036s\n\nFAILED (failures=4, errors=176, skipped=14)\n```\n### Status\n- done, ready for review\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\n- [ ] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide)

is probably like 5th attempt to get pylint working in some form or another on the Libcloud code base.\n\nI tried it a couple of times myself, but I always started with `libcloud/compute/` which has tons of false positives so I always kinda lost the motivation to continue.\n\nBest approach to avoid that is to do it step by step (baby steps!). In this PR I'm starting with `libcloud/dns/` and we can slowly continue from there towards `libcloud/compute/` which will be a massive beast :)\n\nThere are still tons of false positives in other places which will need to be addressed. For now, we can disable some of those warnings, but down the road we will need to change some code and / or write some pylint plugins which let pylint know how to handle some of the more convoluted code.\n","created_at":"2016-04-19T17:36:26Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T18:45:51Z","closed_at":"2016-04-19T18:45:51Z","merged_at":"2016-04-19T18:45:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"8874941d6f7b9e9b2a4a62e0d11ac5dc3b851d02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/768/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/768/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/issues/768/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/libcloud/statuses/8874941d6f7b9e9b2a4a62e0d11ac5dc3b851d02","head":{"label":"Kami:pylint_1","ref":"pylint_1","sha":"8874941d6f7b9e9b2a4a62e0d11ac5dc3b851d02","user":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MTA4NjI=","name":"libcloud","full_name":"Kami/libcloud","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kami","id":125088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTA4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/125088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami","html_url":"https://github.com/Kami","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kami/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kami/libcloud","description":"Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through a unified and easy to use API.

lxml if present causes many errors\n### Description\n\nThis PR asks the question - is [lxml](http://lxml.de/) supported as part of libcloud? Should it be?\n\nSo far it has found little evidence lxml is in practice supported, and real-world errors if lxml is present.\nKnown to affect some real-world AWS S3 cases, and probably lots of other drivers based on the tests which detect 52 errors (Py2.7) and 595 errors (Py3.5). \n\nUnfortunately [lxml](http://lxml.de/) often sneaks its way into real-world virtual environments via dependencies such as [premailer](https://github.com/peterbe/premailer) so removing it entirely from a solution as a workaround would often be difficult to do in practice.\n\nIt would be appreciated if libcloud's authors made a decision about whether to drop lxml in places like this one [here](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/v1.0.0-rc2/libcloud/backup/drivers/dimensiondata.py#L16-L19), or whether the time should be taken to properly support both Python's builtin `xml` module, and `lxml`.\n\nSee also https://github.com/apache/libcloud/commit/0619c9257556b52794f3a2f70760abc01798faf5\n### Status\n-

`_ex_connection_class_kwargs` method would get overridden with `None` if the values for those arguments weren't explicitly passed to the driver constructor.\n\nThis pull request fixes that and adds some test cases to make sure we don't introduce the same regression or break it again in the
