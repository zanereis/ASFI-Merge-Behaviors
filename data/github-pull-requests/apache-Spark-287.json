What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, debug package has a implicit class \"DebugQuery\" which matches Dataset to provide debug features on Dataset class. It doesn't work with structured streaming: it requires query is already started, and the information can be retrieved from StreamingQuery, not Dataset. I guess that's why \"explain\" had to be placed to StreamingQuery whereas it already exists on Dataset.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new implicit class \"DebugStreamQuery\" which matches StreamingQuery to provide similar debug features on StreamingQuery class.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded relevant unit tests.","created_at":"2018-05-03T02:38:08Z","updated_at":"2019-01-25T22:25:43Z","closed_at":"2018-08-06T22:27:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a5314d7df17664c64a7f08b745669d91afa05e18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21222/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21222/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21222/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/34a1e5e5c5bc4db2447a5db0f63a84e8062ca736","head":{"label":"HeartSaVioR:SPARK-24161","ref":"SPARK-24161","sha":"34a1e5e5c5bc4db2447a5db0f63a84e8062ca736","user":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27994296,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzk5NDI5Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"HeartSaVioR/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HeartSaVioR","id":1317309,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTczMDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1317309?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR","html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HeartSaVioR/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HeartSaVioR/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR enables the MicroBatchExecution to run no-data batches if some SparkPlan requires running another batch to output results based on updated watermark / processing time. In this PR, I have enabled streaming aggregations and streaming deduplicates to automatically run addition batch even if new data is available. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24156 for more context.\r\n\r\nMajor changes/refactoring done in this PR.\r\n- Refactoring MicroBatchExecution - A major point of confusion in MicroBatchExecution control flow was always (at least to me) was that `populateStartOffsets` internally called `constructNextBatch` which was not obvious from just the name \"populateStartOffsets\" and made the control flow from the main trigger execution loop very confusing (main loop in `runActivatedStream` called `constructNextBatch` but only if `populateStartOffsets` hadn't already called it). Instead, the refactoring makes it cleaner.\r\n    - `populateStartOffsets` only the updates `availableOffsets` and `committedOffsets`. Does not call `constructNextBatch`.\r\n    - Main loop in `runActivatedStream` calls `constructNextBatch` which returns true or false reflecting whether the next batch is ready for executing. This method is now idempotent; if a batch has already been constructed, then it will always return true until the batch has been executed.\r\n    - If next batch is ready then we call `runBatch` or sleep. \r\n    - That's it.\r\n\r\n- Refactoring watermark management logic - This has been refactored out from `MicroBatchExecution` in a separate class to simplify `MicroBatchExecution`.\r\n\r\n- New method `shouldRunAnotherBatch` in `IncrementalExecution` - This returns true if there is any stateful operation in the last execution plan that requires another batch for state cleanup, etc. This is used to decide whether to construct a batch or not in `constructNextBatch`.\r\n\r\n- Changes to stream testing framework - Many tests used CheckLastBatch to validate answers. This assumed that there will be no more batches after the last set of input has been processed, so the last batch is the one that has output corresponding to the last input. This is not true anymore. To account for that, I made two changes.\r\n    - `CheckNewAnswer` is a new test action that verifies the new rows generated since the last time the answer was checked by `CheckAnswer`, `CheckNewAnswer` or `CheckLastBatch`. This is agnostic to how many batches occurred between the last check and now. To do make this easier, I added a common trait between MemorySink and MemorySinkV2 to abstract out some common methods.\r\n    - `assertNumStateRows` has been updated in the same way to be agnostic to batches while checking what the total rows and how many state rows were updated (sums up updates since the last check).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- Changes made to existing tests - Tests have been changed in one of the following patterns.\r\n    - Tests where the last input was given again to force another batch to be executed and state cleaned up / output generated, they were

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch modifies `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` so that the receipt of zero-size blocks is treated as an error. This is done as a preventative measure to guard against a potential source of data loss bugs.\r\n\r\nIn the shuffle layer, we guarantee that zero-size blocks will never be requested (a block containing zero records is always 0 bytes in size and is marked as empty such that it will never be legitimately requested by executors). However, the existing code does not fully take advantage of this invariant in the shuffle-read path: the existing code did not explicitly check whether blocks are non-zero-size.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, our decompression and deserialization streams treat zero-size inputs as empty streams rather than errors (EOF might actually be treated as \"end-of-stream\" in certain layers (longstanding behavior dating to earliest versions of Spark) and decompressors like Snappy may be tolerant to zero-size inputs).\r\n\r\nAs a result, if some other bug causes legitimate buffers to be replaced with zero-sized buffers (due to corruption on either the send or receive sides) then this would translate into silent data loss rather than an explicit fail-fast error. \r\n\r\nThis patch addresses this problem by adding a `buf.size != 0` check. See code comments for pointers to tests which guarantee the invariants relied on here.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests (which required modifications, since some were creating empty buffers in mocks). I also added a test to make sure we fail on zero-size blocks.\r\n\r\nTo test that the zero-size blocks are indeed a potential corruption source, I manually ran a workload in `spark-shell` with a modified build which replaces all buffers with zero-size buffers in the receive path.","created_at":"2018-05-02T22:12:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-07T06:38:24Z","closed_at":"2018-05-07T06:38:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69f6ac48e320d7cfc28aa05da94adbd5db4ae335","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21219/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21219/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21219/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3ecd7da67e372f2cbb25c61b269030b2115885dd","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-24160","ref":"SPARK-24160","sha":"3ecd7da67e372f2cbb25c61b269030b2115885dd","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDataFrameRangeSuite.test(\"Cancelling stage in a query with Range.\") stays sometimes in an infinite loop and times out the build.\r\n\r\nThere were multiple issues with the test:\r\n\r\n1. The first valid stageId is zero when the test started alone and not in a suite and the following code waits until timeout:\r\n\r\n```\r\neventually(timeout(10.seconds), interval(1.millis)) {\r\n  assert(DataFrameRangeSuite.stageToKill > 0)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `DataFrameRangeSuite.stageToKill` was overwritten by the task's thread after the reset which ended up in canceling the same stage 2 times. This caused the infinite wait.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this mentioned flakyness by removing the shared `DataFrameRangeSuite.stageToKill` and using `onTaskStart` where stage ID is provided. In order to make sure cancelStage called for all stages `waitUntilEmpty` is called on `ListenerBus`.\r\n\r\nIn [PR20888](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20888) this tried to get solved by:\r\n* Stopping the executor thread with `wait`\r\n* Wait for all `cancelStage` called\r\n* Kill the executor thread by setting `SparkContext.SPARK_JOB_INTERRUPT_ON_CANCEL`\r\n\r\nbut the thread killing left the shared `SparkContext` sometimes in a state where further jobs can't be submitted. As a result DataFrameRangeSuite.test(\"Cancelling stage in a query with Range.\") test passed properly but the next test inside the suite was hanging.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit test executed 10k

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current code(`MapOutputTracker.convertMapStatuses`), mapstatus are converted to (blockId, size) pair for all blocks – no matter the block is empty or not, which result in OOM when there are lots of consecutive empty blocks, especially when adaptive execution is enabled.\r\n\r\n(blockId, size) pair is only used in `ShuffleBlockFetcherIterator` to control shuffle-read and only non-empty block request is sent. Can we just filter out the empty blocks in MapOutputTracker.convertMapStatuses and save memory?\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnot added yet.","created_at":"2018-05-02T05:48:56Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T15:43:07Z","closed_at":"2018-05-07T06:21:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"659e0a397770b3d2a123a34bee09bfc7eac7b602","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21212/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21212/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21212/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/094d829ff5c36cdc358f4d6e635297ca4f4e400f","head":{"label":"jinxing64:SPARK-24143","ref":"SPARK-24143","sha":"094d829ff5c36cdc358f4d6e635297ca4f4e400f","user":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":78330400,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3ODMzMDQwMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jinxing64/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinxing64","id":4058918,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwNTg5MTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4058918?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64","html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinxing64/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinxing64/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAlthough [SPARK-22654](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22654) made `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` download from Apache mirrors three times, it has been flaky because it didn't verify the downloaded file. Some Apache mirrors terminate the downloading abnormally, the *corrupted* file shows the following errors.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngzip: stdin: not in gzip format\r\ntar: Child returned status 1\r\ntar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now\r\n22:46:32.700 WARN org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite: \r\n\r\n===== POSSIBLE THREAD LEAK IN SUITE o.a.s.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite, thread names: Keep-Alive-Timer =====\r\n\r\n*** RUN ABORTED ***\r\n  java.io.IOException: Cannot run program \"./bin/spark-submit\" (in directory \"/tmp/test-spark/spark-2.2.0\"): error=2, No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has been reported weirdly in two ways. For example, the above case is reported as Case 2 `no failures`.\r\n\r\n- Case 1. [Test Result (1 failure / +1)](https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/jenkins/view/Spark%20QA%20Test%20(Dashboard)/job/spark-master-test-sbt-hadoop-2.7/4389/)\r\n- Case 2.

If it turns out that the file is empty or corrupted, `HiveExternalCatalogVersionsSuite` will do retry logic like the download failure.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR adds a new collection function, array_repeat. As there already was a function repeat with the same signature, with the only difference being the expected return type (String instead of Array), the new function is called array_repeat to distinguish.\r\nThe behaviour of the function is based on Presto's one.\r\n\r\nThe function creates an array containing a given element repeated the requested number of times.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests added into:\r\n- CollectionExpressionsSuite\r\n- DataFrameFunctionsSuite\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-01T21:27:00Z","updated_at":"2018-05-18T18:00:02Z","closed_at":"2018-05-17T04:35:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b01d31b2c453c7f5ac83f9ceeb3c32918444454f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21208/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21208/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21208/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3bd11e2e25cbc172791b9934279589d0cd459ba5","head":{"label":"pepinoflo:SPARK-23925","ref":"SPARK-23925","sha":"3bd11e2e25cbc172791b9934279589d0cd459ba5","user":{"login":"pepinoflo","id":26009816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDA5ODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26009816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo","html_url":"https://github.com/pepinoflo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":128806342,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjg4MDYzNDI=","name":"spark","full_name":"pepinoflo/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pepinoflo","id":26009816,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDA5ODE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26009816?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo","html_url":"https://github.com/pepinoflo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pepinoflo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pepinoflo/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ColumnVector`s store string data in one big byte array. Since the array size is capped at just under Integer.MAX_VALUE, a single `ColumnVector` cannot store more than 2GB of string data.\r\nBut since the Parquet files commonly contain large blobs stored as strings, and `ColumnVector`s by default carry 4096 values, it's entirely possible to go past that limit. In such cases a negative capacity is requested from `WritableColumnVector.reserve()`. The call succeeds (requested capacity is smaller than already allocated capacity), and consequently `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is thrown when the reader actually attempts to put the data into the array.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces a simple check for integer overflow to `WritableColumnVector.reserve()` which should help catch the error earlier and provide more informative exception. Additionally, the error message in `WritableColumnVector.throwUnsupportedException()` was corrected, as it previously encouraged users to increase rather than reduce the batch size.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew units tests were added.\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-01T09:41:44Z","updated_at":"2018-05-02T19:47:37Z","closed_at":"2018-05-02T19:47:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5c1e1cdc4c88159ebccc71976d6d03822234b41","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21206/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21206/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21206/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b8ee89f3680b1ee3a544bede0ac76fafc9f3a823","head":{"label":"ala:overflow-reserve","ref":"overflow-reserve","sha":"b8ee89f3680b1ee3a544bede0ac76fafc9f3a823","user":{"login":"ala","id":166012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjAxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala","html_url":"https://github.com/ala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":80839594,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MDgzOTU5NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"ala/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ala","id":166012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjAxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala","html_url":"https://github.com/ala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ala/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDo continuous processing writes with multiple compute() calls.\r\n\r\nThe current strategy (before this PR) is hacky; we just call next() on an iterator which has already returned hasNext = false, knowing that all the nodes we whitelist handle this properly. This will have to be changed before we can support more complex query plans. (In particular, I have a WIP https://github.com/jose-torres/spark/pull/13 which should be able to support aggregates in a single partition with minimal additional work.)\r\n\r\nMost of the changes here are just refactoring to accommodate the new model. The behavioral changes are:\r\n\r\n* The writer now calls prev.compute(split, context) once per epoch within the epoch loop.\r\n* ContinuousDataSourceRDD now spawns a ContinuousQueuedDataReader which is shared across multiple calls to compute() for the same partition.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting unit tests","created_at":"2018-04-30T22:41:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T21:19:21Z","closed_at":"2018-05-04T21:19:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8673beace1791b1351d8304785144642af7f912","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/75c0b78f924d9c2f70b737c105e6f3cbc85d3b6e","head":{"label":"jose-torres:noAggr","ref":"noAggr","sha":"75c0b78f924d9c2f70b737c105e6f3cbc85d3b6e","user":{"login":"jose-torres","id":30604243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjA0MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30604243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres","html_url":"https://github.com/jose-torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":98938104,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5ODkzODEwNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"jose-torres/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jose-torres","id":30604243,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNjA0MjQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30604243?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres","html_url":"https://github.com/jose-torres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jose-torres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jose-torres/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport for text socket stream in spark structured streaming \"continuous\" mode. This is roughly based on the idea of ContinuousMemoryStream where the executor queries the data from driver over an RPC endpoint.\r\n\r\nThis makes it possible to create Structured streaming continuous pipeline to ingest data via \"nc\" and run examples.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and ran spark examples in structured streaming continuous mode.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes the ramp-up of the rate source for the case `rowsPerSecond <= rampUpTime` which previously resulted in a flat ramp-up (0-value until the clock reached `rampUpTime`. For example: \r\n![image-2018-04-22-22-06-49-202](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/874997/51993288-d2241400-24ae-11e9-84c4-6f948edc3303.png)\r\n\r\nSee details in  [SPARK-24046](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24046)\r\n\r\nThis implementation replaces the original code. Uses the distance quadratic function, meaning that ramp-up is a smooth parabole that joins the linear constant rate at `rampUpTime`:\r\nOriginal vs. this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch tries to implement this [proposal](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19813#issuecomment-354045400) to add an API for handling expression code generation. It should allow us to manipulate how to generate codes for expressions.\r\n\r\nIn details, this adds an new abstraction `CodeBlock` to `JavaCode`. `CodeBlock` holds the code snippet and inputs for generating actual java code.\r\n\r\nFor example, in following java code:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n  int ${variable} = 1;\r\n  boolean ${isNull} = ${CodeGenerator.defaultValue(BooleanType)};\r\n```\r\n\r\n`variable`, `isNull` are two `VariableValue` and `CodeGenerator.defaultValue(BooleanType)` is a string. They are all inputs to this code block and held by `CodeBlock` representing this code.\r\n\r\nFor codegen, we provide a specified string interpolator `code`, so you can define a code like this:\r\n```scala\r\n  val codeBlock =\r\n    code\"\"\"\r\n         |int ${variable} = 1;\r\n         |boolean ${isNull} = ${CodeGenerator.defaultValue(BooleanType)};\r\n        \"\"\".stripMargin\r\n  // Generates actual java code.\r\n  codeBlock.toString\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause those inputs are held separately in `CodeBlock` before generating code, we can safely manipulate them, e.g., replacing statements to aliased variables, etc..\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-30T13:36:09Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:36Z","closed_at":"2018-05-22T17:55:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"928c2e3ce85131c8d7314b6a411851ccc124c575","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00cc564d0c6d6af2c443153f55705ec491fdfa1d","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-24121","ref":"SPARK-24121","sha":"00cc564d0c6d6af2c443153f55705ec491fdfa1d","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nI propose flexible format for the **lineSep** option used in text datasources like Json. New format of the option has the following syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlineSep ::= (selector separator-spec) | text-separator\r\nselector := 'x' | '\\' | reserved-selector\r\nreserved-selector ::= '\\' | 'r'\r\nseparator-spec ::= < valid string literal in Python, R, Java and Scala>\r\ntext-separator ::= first-char separator-spec\r\nfirst-char ::= ! selector\r\n```\r\n\r\nExamples of lineSep in the new format:\r\n\r\n```\r\nx0a.00.00.00 0d.00.00.00\r\nx5445\r\n|^|\r\n\\r\\n\r\n-\r\nsep\r\n```\r\nThe `'\\'` and `'r'` are reserved for future usage. For instance, `'r'` could be used for regular expressions line `r[0-9]+` or `r(x1E|x0Ax1E|x0A)` for parsing [Json Streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_streaming)\r\n\r\nNew format addresses the use cases:\r\n\r\n1. Hexadecimal format allows to specify `lineSep` independently from encoding. It gives opportunity for reading json files with BOM in per-line mode. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20849#issuecomment-377501993\r\n\r\n2. Jsons coming usually from embedded systems have not-standard separators (invisible in some cases). It is very convenient to open a file in hex editor and copy bytes between }{ to the lineSep option. This is the use case for the format with `'x'` selector like: `x0d 54 45`\r\n\r\n3. In Json Streaming, records could be separated in pretty different ways. We should leave room for improvement I believe. See `'r'` (for regexp) and `'/'` reserved selectors\r\n\r\n4. Some UTF-8 chars could cause errors from style (format) checkers. It is easier to represent such chars in hexadecimal format instead of disabling the checkers.\r\n\r\n5. In near future, json datasource will support input json in different charsets. If the source code in UTF-8 but input json in different charset, it is slightly hard to put such chars as values for the lineSep option. The `x<hexs>` format is more convenient here again. \r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe changes are checked by 2 new tests in which JSON files in `UTF-16` and `UTF-32` with BOM are read. Also 2 new cases for an existing test are added.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-29T19:56:22Z","updated_at":"2019-08-17T13:34:56Z","closed_at":"2018-07-18T07:18:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ade8ead5d8581b805b863d937050af5de0c56de0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21192/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21192/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21192/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5384c073a0761dbe24ec52e9474d618535ad8f69","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:json-flexible-line-sep2","ref":"json-flexible-line-sep2","sha":"5384c073a0761dbe24ec52e9474d618535ad8f69","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20136 . #20136 didn't really work because in the test, we are using local backend, which shares the driver side `SparkEnv`, so `SparkEnv.get.executorId == SparkContext.DRIVER_IDENTIFIER` doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the check to `TaskContext.get != null`, and move the check to `SQLConf.get`, and fix all the places that violate this check:\r\n* `InMemoryTableScanExec#createAndDecompressColumn` is executed inside `rdd.map`, we can't access `conf.offHeapColumnVectorEnabled` there. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21223 merged\r\n* `DataType#sameType` may be executed in executor side, for things like json schema inference, so we can't call `conf.caseSensitiveAnalysis` there. This contributes to most of the code changes, as we need to add `caseSensitive` parameter to a lot of methods.\r\n* `ParquetFilters` is used in the file scan function, which is executed in executor side, so we can't can't call `conf.parquetFilterPushDownDate` there. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21224 merged\r\n* `WindowExec#createBoundOrdering` is called on executor side, so we can't use `conf.sessionLocalTimezone` there. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21225 merged\r\n* `JsonToStructs` can be serialized to executors and evaluate, we should not call `SQLConf.get.getConf(SQLConf.FROM_JSON_FORCE_NULLABLE_SCHEMA)` in the body. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/21226 merged\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd SQL support for Pivot according to Pivot grammar defined by Oracle (https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/img_text/pivot_clause.htm) with some simplifications, based on our existing functionality and limitations for Pivot at the backend:\r\n1. For pivot_for_clause (https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/img_text/pivot_for_clause.htm), the column list form is not supported, which means the pivot column can only be one single column.\r\n2. For pivot_in_clause (https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/img_text/pivot_in_clause.htm), the sub-query form and \"ANY\" is not supported (this is only supported by Oracle for XML anyway).\r\n3. For pivot_in_clause, aliases for the constant values are not supported.\r\n\r\nThe code changes are:\r\n1. Add parser support for Pivot. Note that according to https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/statements_10002.htm#i2076542, Pivot cannot be used together with lateral views in the from clause. This restriction has been implemented in the Parser rule.\r\n2. Infer group-by expressions: group-by expressions are not explicitly specified in SQL Pivot clause and need to be deduced based on this rule: https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF/statements_10002.htm#CHDFAFIE, so we have to post-fix it at query analysis stage.\r\n3. Override Pivot.resolved as \"false\": for the reason mentioned in [2] and the fact that output attributes change after Pivot being replaced by Project or Aggregate, we avoid resolving parent references until after Pivot has been resolved and replaced.\r\n4. Verify aggregate expressions: only aggregate expressions with or without aliases can appear in the first part of the Pivot clause, and this check is performed as analysis stage.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA new test suite PivotSuite is added.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-28T02:40:51Z","updated_at":"2018-05-04T00:09:06Z","closed_at":"2018-05-04T00:09:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f3ff328199ded704f1147cc01bcd1d996fe751fe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21187/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21187/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21187/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c7eacf50ee3ea0e7da34ceb521aeb13ed5f5f84c","head":{"label":"maryannxue:spark-24035","ref":"spark-24035","sha":"c7eacf50ee3ea0e7da34ceb521aeb13ed5f5f84c","user":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104110775,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQxMTA3NzU=","name":"spark","full_name":"maryannxue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"maryannxue","id":4171904,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxNzE5MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4171904?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue","html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/maryannxue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/maryannxue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhile reading CSV or JSON files, DataFrameReader's options are converted to Hadoop's parameters, for example there:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/DataSourceScanExec.scala#L302\r\n\r\nbut the options are not propagated to Text datasource on schema inferring, for instance:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.3/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/csv/CSVDataSource.scala#L184-L188\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes propagation of user's options to Text datasource on scheme inferring in similar way as user's options are converted to Hadoop parameters if schema is specified.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nThe changes were tested manually by using https://github.com/twitter/hadoop-lzo:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhadoop-lzo> mvn clean package\r\nhadoop-lzo> ln -s ./target/hadoop-lzo-0.4.21-SNAPSHOT.jar ./hadoop-lzo.jar\r\n```\r\nCreate 2 test files in JSON and CSV format and compress them:\r\n```shell\r\n$ cat test.csv\r\ncol1|col2\r\na|1\r\n$ lzop test.csv\r\n$ cat test.json\r\n{\"col1\":\"a\",\"col2\":1}\r\n$ lzop test.json\r\n```\r\nRun `spark-shell` with hadoop-lzo:\r\n```\r\nbin/spark-shell --jars ~/hadoop-lzo/hadoop-lzo.jar\r\n```\r\nreading compressed CSV and JSON without schema:\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"io.compression.codecs\", \"com.hadoop.compression.lzo.LzopCodec\").option(\"inferSchema\",true).option(\"header\",true).option(\"sep\",\"|\").csv(\"test.csv.lzo\").show()\r\n+----+----+\r\n|col1|col2|\r\n+----+----+\r\n|   a|   1|\r\n+----+----+\r\n```\r\n```scala\r\nspark.read.option(\"io.compression.codecs\", \"com.hadoop.compression.lzo.LzopCodec\").option(\"multiLine\",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR ``_hack_namedtuple`` was applied to all namedtuples,\r\nregardless if they were defined on the top level of some module, and\r\nare therefore picklable using the default ``__reduce__`` implementation,\r\nor not.\r\n\r\nThe PR ensures that only the non-picklable namedtuples are hacked, i.e.\r\nthe ones defined in the REPL or locally in a function or method.\r\n\r\nNote that the namedtuple might be defined locally but still be picklable\r\nwithout the hack applied.\r\n\r\n    def define():\r\n        global Foo\r\n        Foo = namedtuple(\"Foo\", [])\r\n\r\nThe current implementation does not cover such cases and will apply\r\nthe hack anyway.\r\n\r\nSidenote: the PR also fixes the module name of the hacked namedtuples.\r\nDue to an extra layer of indirection added by ``_hijack_namedtuple``,\r\nall hacked namedtuples had \"collections\" as ``__module__``. This\r\nbehaviour is no longer the case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSerializationTestCase and RDDTests.","created_at":"2018-04-27T14:45:13Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T15:07:04Z","closed_at":"2018-09-27T16:28:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6476e53ea8e2ea1732ed97c7560f82b0d352da9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21180/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21180/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21180/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ec33738fce8f04606fcfc1c2a737777077046aaa","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:hijack-non-importable-namedtuple","ref":"hijack-non-importable-namedtuple","sha":"ec33738fce8f04606fcfc1c2a737777077046aaa","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark ThriftServer will call UGI.loginUserFromKeytab twice in initialization. This is unnecessary and will cause various potential problems, like Hadoop IPC failure after 7 days, or RM failover issue and so on.\r\n\r\nSo here we need to remove all the unnecessary login logics and make sure UGI in the context never be created again.\r\n\r\nNote this is actually a HS2 issue, If later on we upgrade supported Hive version, the issue may already be fixed in Hive side.\r\n\r\n##

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this case, the partition pruning happens before the planning phase of scalar subquery expressions.\r\nFor scalar subquery expressions, the planning occurs late in the cycle (after the physical planning)  in \"PlanSubqueries\" just before execution. Currently we try to execute the scalar subquery expression as part of partition pruning and fail as it implements Unevaluable.\r\n\r\nThe fix attempts to ignore the Subquery expressions from partition pruning computation. Another option can be to somehow plan the subqueries before the partition pruning. Since this may not be a commonly occuring expression, i am opting for a simpler fix.\r\n\r\nRepro\r\n``` SQL\r\nCREATE TABLE test_prc_bug (\r\nid_value string\r\n)\r\npartitioned by (id_type

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nEvent `SparkListenerDriverAccumUpdates` may happen multiple times in a query - e.g. every `FileSourceScanExec` and `BroadcastExchangeExec` call `postDriverMetricUpdates`.\nIn Spark 2.2 `SQLListener` updated the map with new values. `SQLAppStatusListener` overwrites it.\nUnless `update` preserved it in the KV store (dependant on `exec.lastWriteTime`), only the metrics from the last operator that does `postDriverMetricUpdates` are preserved.\n\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test added.","created_at":"2018-04-26T17:58:27Z","updated_at":"2018-04-27T21:18:35Z","closed_at":"2018-04-27T21:18:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ee975e0a97150db3b02e668e132f5512973e3adb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21171/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21171/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21171/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/69e09cc770514bdb7964b8552456bf7a83df7588","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-24104","ref":"SPARK-24104","sha":"69e09cc770514bdb7964b8552456bf7a83df7588","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`from_utc_timestamp` assumes its input is in UTC timezone and shifts it to the specified timezone. When the timestamp contains timezone(e.g. `2018-03-13T06:18:23+00:00`), Spark breaks the semantic and respect the timezone in the string. This is not what user expects and the result is different from Hive/Impala. `to_utc_timestamp` has the same problem.\r\n\r\nMore details please refer to the JIRA ticket.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by

Currently we use the executor to tasks mapping relation to identify the status of executors, in maximum task failure situation, some TaskEnd events may never be delivered, which makes the related executor always be busy.\r\n\r\n#19580 fix the incorrect number of running tasks.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the problem in a similar way on the `fact` that TaskEnd events may never be delivered but StageCompleted events would be delivered eventually.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe ultimate goal is for listeners to onTaskEnd to receive metrics when a task is killed intentionally, since the data is currently just thrown

This is already done for ExceptionFailure, so this just copies the same approach.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated existing tests.\r\n\r\nThis is a rework of

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change.\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit PySpark patched ``collections.namedtuple`` to make\r\nnamedtuple instances serializable even if the namedtuple class has been\r\ndefined outside of ``globals()``, e.g.\r\n\r\n    def do_something():\r\n        Foo = namedtuple(\"Foo\", [\"foo\"])\r\n        sc.parallelize(range(1)).map(lambda _: Foo(42))\r\n\r\nThe patch changed the pickled representation of the namedtuple instance\r\nto include the structure of namedtuple class, and recreate the class on\r\neach unpickling. This behaviour causes hard to diagnose failures both\r\nin the user code with namedtuples, as well as third-party libraries\r\nrelying on them. See [1] and [2] for details.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://superbobry.github.io/pyspark-silently-breaks-your-namedtuples.html\r\n[2]:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Spark drivers run on mesos with supervise enabled will try the driver indefinitely on failures. This PR is to optionally limit the number of retries to a configurable number.\r\n* Introducing sparkConf \"spark.mesos.driver.supervise.maxRetries\" which limits the number of times the driver can be retried. The default behavior is for the driver to be retried indefinitely.\r\n* When the check is made to see if supervise is enabled and the job has to be retried, an additional check is made to see if the allowable retries have been exceeded.\r\n* Added unit tests for method hasDriverExceededRetries.\r\n* Added documentation for \"spark.mesos.driver.supervise.maxRetries\".\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests\r\n\r\nBuilt spark package, dockerized it and deployed it as a service on Mesos. Once spark service was running on mesos, a series of drivers were submitted\r\n\r\n1. With supervise disabled, ran a successful driver\r\n2. With supervise disabled, ran a failure driver\r\n3. With supervise enabled, ran a successful driver\r\n4. With supervise enabled and without setting \"spark.mesos.driver.supervise.maxRetries\", ran failure driver\r\n5. With supervise enabled and setting \"spark.mesos.driver.supervise.maxRetries=1\", ran a failure driver\r\n6. With supervise enabled and setting \"spark.mesos.driver.supervise.maxRetries=3\", ran a failure

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHashAggregate uses the same hash algorithm and seed as ShuffleExchange, it may lead to bad hash conflict when shuffle.partitions=8192*n.\r\n\r\nConsidering below example:\r\n```\r\nSET spark.sql.shuffle.partitions=8192;\r\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE target_xxx\r\nSELECT\r\n item_id,\r\n auct_end_dt\r\nFROM\r\n from source_xxx\r\nGROUP BY\r\n item_id,\r\n auct_end_dt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the shuffle stage, if user sets the shuffle.partition = 8192, all tuples in the same partition will meet the following relationship:\r\n```\r\nhash(tuple x) = hash(tuple y) + n * 8192\r\n```\r\nThen in the next HashAggregate stage, all tuples from the same partition need be put into a 16K BytesToBytesMap (unsafeRowAggBuffer).\r\n\r\nHere, the HashAggregate uses the same hash algorithm on the same expression as shuffle, and uses the same seed, and 16K = 8192 * 2, so actually, all tuples in the same parititon will only be hashed to 2 different places in the BytesToBytesMap. It is bad hash conflict. With BytesToBytesMap growing, the conflict will always exist.\r\n\r\nBefore change:\r\n<img width=\"334\" alt=\"hash_conflict\"

The hadoop s3n connector is never going to be updated to work with a later version of jets3t, instead the code has just been [cut from hadoop 3.x entirely.](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.1.0/hadoop-aws/tools/hadoop-aws/s3n.html).\r\n\r\nThis patch remove the declarations of jets3t from the POMs which include it (root and spark-core), so it is not being packaged up.\r\n\r\nOf the transitive dependencies, one is pinned at the same version, the others removed.\r\n\r\n* javax.activation is kept at version 1.1.1. by an explicit import; without this it would be downgraded to version 1.0.\r\n* bcprov-jdk15on-1.58.jar, base64-2.3.8.jar, java-xmlbuilder-1.1.jar are all removed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRenames:\r\n* `DataReaderFactory` to `InputPartition`\r\n* `DataReader` to `InputPartitionReader`\r\n* `createDataReaderFactories` to `planInputPartitions`\r\n* `createUnsafeDataReaderFactories` to `planUnsafeInputPartitions`\r\n* `createBatchDataReaderFactories` to `planBatchInputPartitions`\r\n\r\nThis fixes the changes in SPARK-23219, which renamed ReadTask to\r\nDataReaderFactory. The intent of that change was to make the read and\r\nwrite API match (write side uses DataWriterFactory), but the underlying\r\nproblem is that the two classes are not equivalent.\r\n\r\nReadTask/DataReader function as Iterable/Iterator. One InputPartition is\r\na specific partition of the data to be read, in contrast to\r\nDataWriterFactory where the same factory instance is used in all write\r\ntasks. InputPartition's purpose is to manage the lifecycle of the\r\nassociated reader, which is now called InputPartitionReader, with an\r\nexplicit create operation to mirror the close operation. This was no\r\nlonger clear from the API because DataReaderFactory appeared to be more\r\ngeneric than it is and it isn't clear why a set of them is produced for\r\na read.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, which have been updated to use the new name.","created_at":"2018-04-24T19:58:46Z","updated_at":"2018-05-10T04:52:52Z","closed_at":"2018-05-10T04:52:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4d96690d25c743fcf74b17b0c526c2fa88d17bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21145/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21145/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21145/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1423979edd24aa869b945bc3911630176c83eee5","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-24073-revert-data-reader-factory-rename","ref":"SPARK-24073-revert-data-reader-factory-rename","sha":"1423979edd24aa869b945bc3911630176c83eee5","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen `PyArrow` or `Pandas` are not available, the corresponding PySpark tests are skipped automatically. Currently, PySpark tests fail when we are not using `-Phive`. This PR aims to skip Hive related PySpark tests when `-Phive` is not given.\r\n\r\n**BEFORE**\r\n```bash\r\n$ build/mvn -DskipTests clean package\r\n$ python/run-tests.py --python-executables python2.7 --modules pyspark-sql\r\nFile \"/Users/dongjoon/spark/python/pyspark/sql/readwriter.py\", line 295, in pyspark.sql.readwriter.DataFrameReader.table\r\n...\r\nIllegalArgumentException: u\"Error while instantiating 'org.apache.spark.sql.hive.HiveExternalCatalog':\"\r\n**********************************************************************\r\n   1 of   3 in pyspark.sql.readwriter.DataFrameReader.table\r\n***Test Failed*** 1 failures.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**AFTER**\r\n```bash\r\n$ build/mvn -DskipTests clean package\r\n$ python/run-tests.py --python-executables python2.7 --modules pyspark-sql\r\n...\r\nTests passed in 138 seconds\r\n\r\nSkipped tests in pyspark.sql.tests with python2.7:\r\n...\r\n    test_hivecontext (pyspark.sql.tests.HiveSparkSubmitTests) ... skipped 'Hive is not available.'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is a test-only change. First, this should pass the Jenkins. Then, manually do the following.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbuild/mvn -DskipTests clean package\r\npython/run-tests.py --python-executables python2.7 --modules

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSPARK-22543 fixes the 64kb compile error for deeply nested expression for non-wholestage codegen. This PR extends it to support wholestage codegen.\r\n\r\nThis patch extracts necessary parameters for a deeply nested expression when it is split into a function.\r\n\r\nTODO: In the future, this should be extended to `splitExpressions` too to automatically extract the current inputs and put them into the parameter list.\r\n\r\nWIP: This is in WIP status for now. It brings up previous changes in #19813 with latest codebase. This will implement the proposal https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19813#issuecomment-354045400 to overcome the limit in the previous PR.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests and existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-24T10:12:35Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:35:21Z","closed_at":"2018-07-16T22:16:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"347fbc1720a1b59cbe32e99fd4c914161c226219","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21140/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21140/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21140/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/85568e774d48675278fe8f0ef3331e30923b6e6b","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-22600-2","ref":"SPARK-22600-2","sha":"85568e774d48675278fe8f0ef3331e30923b6e6b","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor the details of the exception please see [SPARK-24062](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-24062).\r\n\r\nThe issue is:\r\n\r\nSpark on Yarn stores SASL secret in current UGI's credentials, this credentials will be distributed to AM and executors, so that executors and drive share the same secret to communicate. But STS/Hive library code will refresh the current UGI by UGI's loginFromKeytab() after Spark application is started, this will create a new UGI in the current driver's context with empty tokens and secret keys, so secret key is lost in the current context's UGI, that's why Spark driver throws secret key not found exception.\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.2 code, Spark also stores this secret key in SecurityManager's class variable, so even UGI is refreshed, the secret is still existed in the object, so STS with SASL can still be worked in Spark 2.2. But in Spark 2.3, we always search key from current UGI, which makes it fail to work in Spark 2.3.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, there're two possible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Fix in STS/Hive library, when a new UGI is refreshed, copy the secret key from original UGI to the new one. The difficulty is that some codes to refresh the UGI is existed in Hive library, which makes us hard to change the code.\r\n2. Roll back the logics in SecurityManager to match Spark 2.2, so that this issue can be fixed.\r\n\r\n2nd solution seems a simple one. So I will propose a PR with 2nd solution.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nVerified in local cluster.\r\n\r\nCC @vanzin  @tgravescs  please help to review. Thanks!\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-24T08:31:46Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T05:31:35Z","closed_at":"2018-04-26T05:31:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be58229cff32c649f692deb3ff10fd38f84ec459","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/21138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/21138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/00776858c2e776f46dbe542effe52a19283e752f","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-24062","ref":"SPARK-24062","sha":"00776858c2e776f46dbe542effe52a19283e752f","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the driver side of the Kafka source (i.e. KafkaMicroBatchReader) eagerly creates a consumer as soon as the Kafk aMicroBatchReader is created. However, we create dummy KafkaMicroBatchReader to get the schema and immediately stop it. Its better to make the consumer creation lazy, it will be created on the first attempt to fetch offsets using the KafkaOffsetReader.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ApproximatePercentile` contains a workaround logic to compress the samples since at the beginning `QuantileSummaries` was ignoring the compression threshold. This problem was fixed in SPARK-17439, but the workaround logic was not removed. So we are compressing the samples many more times than needed: this could lead to critical performance degradation.\r\n\r\nThis can create serious performance issues in queries like:\r\n```\r\nselect approx_percentile(id, array(0.1)) from range(10000000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nadded
