What is this PR for?\n\nWhen non authenticated user in non-anonymous mode tries to send any websocket api message it results in throwing a traceback.

on PING\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[Zeppelin-1298](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1298)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nFollow the steps in issue and shouldn't get repeating traceback.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? no\n","created_at":"2016-08-06T07:50:26Z","updated_at":"2016-08-09T07:29:36Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T00:54:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ccf8d0056ee2a78b945c6c94f544cad1e77ffc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1293/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1293/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1293/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/ff7812ab49773bcbb55d84cca3b146f54b93118f","head":{"label":"khalidhuseynov:hotfix/zeppelin-1298","ref":"hotfix/zeppelin-1298","sha":"ff7812ab49773bcbb55d84cca3b146f54b93118f","user":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33517255,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzUxNzI1NQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"khalidhuseynov/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khalidhuseynov","id":1642088,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDIwODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1642088?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov","html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khalidhuseynov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khalidhuseynov/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nCurrently, if there are two notebook storages configured, the sync process treats them equally and can pull changes from either storage. This can cause confusions if there is a clear distinction between primary and secondary storages, and the primary storage is managed outside of Zeppelin itself, such as a local folder that's git controlled. If a notebook is deleted or reverted to an older version in the primary storage behind Zeppelin's back, the sync process will overwrite the change with data from the secondary storage, likely against the user's intention.\n\nThe proposal is to enable the scenario with a one-way sync flag, where the primary storage is treated as the only source of truth and the secondary storage is merely a mirror of the primary.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1294\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Setup two notebook storages through `ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_STORAGE`, with the first is local file storage, i.e. `org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.VFSNotebookRepo`. The second storage can be anything, e.g. `org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.zeppelinhub.ZeppelinHubRepo`.\n2. Add `export ZEPPELIN_NOTEBOOK_ONE_WAY_SYNC=true` to `zeppelin-env.sh`.\n3. Start Zeppelin server.\n4. Delete a notebook directly from the notebook folder.\n5. Refresh notebooks from Zeppelin UI.\n6. Observe from the secondary storage that the notebook has been deleted.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? Documentation for the new flag has been added to `install.md`\n","created_at":"2016-08-05T00:24:05Z","updated_at":"2016-10-19T16:50:21Z","closed_at":"2016-08-16T09:28:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1637853d9990c850b20455e274d685ceacf6fb81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/75a067078a0bfe543fc11a65ebafe1c21a345a3c","head":{"label":"optimizely:hao/one-way-sync","ref":"hao/one-way-sync","sha":"75a067078a0bfe543fc11a65ebafe1c21a345a3c","user":{"login":"optimizely","id":1274132,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNzQxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1274132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely","html_url":"https://github.com/optimizely","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":60552541,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MDU1MjU0MQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"optimizely/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"optimizely","id":1274132,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjEyNzQxMzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1274132?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely","html_url":"https://github.com/optimizely","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/optimizely/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/optimizely/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nThere are 2 issues and their proposed fixes:\n1. On a paragraph run, for every line of output, there is a broadcast of the new line from zeppelin. In case of thousands of lines of output, the browser/s would hang because of the volume of these append-output events.\n2. In the above case, besides the browser-hang, another bug observed is that result data is will repeated twice (coming from append-output calls + finish-event calls).\n\nThe proposed solution for #1 is:\n- Buffer the append-output event into a queue instead of sending the event immediately.\n- In a separate thread, read from the queue periodically and send the append-output event.\n\nSolution for #2 is:\n- Donot append output to result if the paragraph is not runnig.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement + Bug Fix\n### Todos\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1292\n### How should this be tested?\n\nThe test could be to run a simple paragraph with large result. Eg:\n\n```\n%sh\nfor i in {1..10000}\ndo\necho $i\ndone\n```\n\nPS: One will need to clear browser cache between running with and without this code patch since there are javascript changes as well. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?\n  No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions?\n  No\n- Does this needs documentation?\n  It could need for the design. Otherwise I have added code comments explaining

What is this PR for?\n\nThis is a small refactoring to keep this Controller following the [ControllerAs with vm](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1#controlleras-with-vm)\nrules, that it was based on.\n\nHere is a list of things that were changed and why:\n- Most of the controller's $scope values & fct (except from the search q) where moved to the vm.The controller is using vm, so storing in $scope to share with the view is not needed.\n- Functions or Vars that are not used in the view were removed from the vm. (kept private to the controller)\n- $rootscope functions was moved to `app.js`. I think  the need for that function might need to be changed, but for the scope of this PR, we are just moving it to where the $rootScope values are declared.\n- Gathering vm declaration before the functions and ordered alphabetically\n- Re-order functions alphabetically\n- Create `initController` to regroup all the controller setup.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nRefactoring\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1290\n### How should this be tested?\n\nYou can Just verify that the below Navbar related features are still good:\n- Search Form\n- Connected Status\n- Login button\n- User Name and its dropdown menu\n- Notebook list drop-down menu (and filer, folder inside of it)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-08-04T08:28:29Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T08:23:55Z","closed_at":"2016-08-09T12:03:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"55938119e890eb2e9b56d08765b34eb6c1b20cf1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1281/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1281/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1281/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/31f91109bed56e78c0c4781f07dd87bbb4b7d260","head":{"label":"corneadoug:Refactor/navbarCtrl","ref":"Refactor/navbarCtrl","sha":"31f91109bed56e78c0c4781f07dd87bbb4b7d260","user":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33177730,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzE3NzczMA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"corneadoug/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nThe Notebook Title Input would not disappear after being edited.\nThis is a problem made by its plugin elastic-input.\nWe originally used ng-if instead of ng-show so it doesn't break the Page Print, however that change made the scope value to toggle unusable.\nSo we added a trustworthy small controller on top of the component.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1276\n### How should this be tested?\n- Click on the Notebook title\n- Try to do: Enter or Esc or Click somewhere else\n- The Input border should not be there anymore\n- Do the same for the Paragraph\n- If you do Print Page there shouldn't any titles duplicated at the top\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-08-03T07:48:50Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T04:02:20Z","closed_at":"2016-08-05T04:01:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"46fc895f15e0ee39d20185c0bfea518f71d98319","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1273/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1273/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1273/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/7d320901748f2049e10726dbf1914b9ef32831c3","head":{"label":"corneadoug:ZEPPELIN-1276","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1276","sha":"7d320901748f2049e10726dbf1914b9ef32831c3","user":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33177730,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzE3NzczMA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"corneadoug/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nAs more and more document pages are added, it's really hard to find specific pages. So I added searching feature to Zeppelin documentation site([jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) based site) using [lunr.js](http://lunrjs.com/).\n- **How does it work?**\n  \n  I created [`search_data.json`](https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin/blob/6e02423f541cc406e4e41031629609a276a9f481/docs/search_data.json) which is used for docs info template. `lunr.js` combines all of the text from all of the docs in `docs/` into `_site/search_data.json`. It looks like below.\n  ![screen shot 2016-08-03 at 4 49 59 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/17342828/f2908be8-5935-11e6-8eee-b189677c0531.png)\n  All the info are comes from [Jekyll YAML front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) variables. (i.e. title, group, description.. that's why I rewrote all docs' title and description.)\n  [search.js](https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin/blob/6e02423f541cc406e4e41031629609a276a9f481/docs/assets/themes/zeppelin/js/search.js) will do this job using this data!\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement & Feature\n### Todos\n- [x] - Keep consistency for all docs pages' `Title`\n- [x] - Add some overview sentences to all docs pages' `Description` section (this will be used as the result preview)\n- [x] - Add apache license header to all docs page (some pages are missing the license header currently)\n- [x] - Add LICENSE for `lunr.min.js`\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1219)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Apply this patch and build `ZEPPELIN_HOME/docs` dir -> please see [docs/README.md#build-documentation](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/tree/master/docs#build-documentation)\n2. Click `search` icon in navbar and go to `search.html` page\n3. Type anything you want to search in the search bar (i.e. type `python`, `spark`, `dynamic` ... )\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![screen shot 2016-08-03 at 4 42 28 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/17357851/d092e2ca-5999-11e6-9917-a3d4113e6e43.png)\n\n![search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10060731/17357828/b2486cd6-5999-11e6-873b-121fac033b03.gif)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? Yes, for `lunr.min.js`\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? no\n","created_at":"2016-08-02T20:16:53Z","updated_at":"2016-08-10T03:39:53Z","closed_at":"2016-08-10T03:39:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d18ccbfa784f41fc2216e8cf0f9f1e3166c915ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1266/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1266/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1266/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/7ec885486065527d52608a16152d04b6e729d00c","head":{"label":"AhyoungRyu:ZEPPELIN-1219","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1219","sha":"7ec885486065527d52608a16152d04b6e729d00c","user":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44792338,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDc5MjMzOA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AhyoungRyu","id":10060731,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDYwNzMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10060731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu","html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AhyoungRyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AhyoungRyu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

This PR extract the setup staff for pyspark interpreter into method setupConfForPySpark and use it for both spark1 and spark2. But this is just a short term solution, as I think this should be handled by spark rather than zeppelin, here zeppelin duplicate part of spark's work. In the long term, I'd like to resolve it in `ZEPPELIN-1263`.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix]\n### Todos\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1263\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1267\n### How should this be tested?\n\nVerify it manually. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![2016-08-02_1749](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/164491/17324523/7d349c60-58d9-11e6-9d3e-5072e1505575.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

The cause is that SecurityManager will add secretkey to credential, so before that we should do login, otherwise Executor can not connect to HttpFileServer on driver correctly due to the missing of secretkey. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix]\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1215\n### How should this be tested?\n\nTest it on secured cluster manually. \n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

This behavior is not natural and consistent with other notebooks. This PR is to make the pyspark interpreter in zeppelin behave the same as other notebook. 2 main changes \n- use single mode to compile the last statement, so that the evaluation result of the last statement will be printed to stdout, this is consistent with other notebooks (like jupyter)\n- Make SparkOutputStream extends LogOutputStream so that we can see the output of inner process (Python/R), it is helpful for diagnosing. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix]\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1197\n### How should this be tested?\n\nTested it manually. Input the following text in pyspark paragraph,\n\n```\n1+1\nsc.version\n```\n\nAnd get the following output\n\n```\nu'1.6.1'\n```\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? User don't need to call print explicitly. \n- Does this needs documentation? Yes\n","created_at":"2016-07-27T05:43:04Z","updated_at":"2016-08-04T01:00:41Z","closed_at":"2016-08-03T15:36:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb978dde07c1c72972c3efacaefd32760f0e047e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1232/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1232/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1232/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/377124546bdf029d594de3f66248afc7f441edd2","head":{"label":"zjffdu:ZEPPELIN-1197","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1197","sha":"377124546bdf029d594de3f66248afc7f441edd2","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46907161,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjkwNzE2MQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"zjffdu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

The cause the issue that AM log is not available for yarn-client mode because the yarn app also use the `ZEPPELIN_HOME/conf/log4j.properties` which is only for zeppelin server. So this PR just distinguish the CLASSPATH of zeppelin server and remote interpreter process. I use `ZEPPELIN_INTP_CLASSPATH` to represent the classpath of remote interpreter process and won't include `ZEPPELIN_HOME/conf/log4j.properties` in `ZEPPELIN_INTP_CLASSPATH`. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1175\n### How should this be tested?\n\nTested manually. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? Yes, if user put custom config file (hive-site.xml) under ZEPPELIN_HOME/conf, it won't take effect after this PR \n- Does this needs documentation? Yes\n","created_at":"2016-07-26T02:48:04Z","updated_at":"2016-08-01T06:12:27Z","closed_at":"2016-08-01T06:12:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2f2f0f6a033a6d9a146e8c507b7c9b8e2d3f58d2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1228/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1228/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1228/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/0973477dcfc84a5121a1e83f6a3f835bfab6e7ea","head":{"label":"zjffdu:ZEPPELIN-1175","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1175","sha":"0973477dcfc84a5121a1e83f6a3f835bfab6e7ea","user":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":46907161,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NjkwNzE2MQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"zjffdu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zjffdu","id":164491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/164491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu","html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zjffdu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zjffdu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nIn order to bust the cache when there is changes to the code of zeppelin-web after build, we are adding hashes at the end of the imported .js and .css files we use.\nEvery time there is changes in one of those file, the hash will change and the browser will use new file instead of cached one.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1229\n### How should this be tested?\n- Build zeppelin-web once and write down the HASH in `dist/scripts/scripts.HASH.js`\n- After making a change inside a .js file of the application and building again, the hash in `dist/scripts/scripts.HASH.js` should be changed.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-07-25T05:25:28Z","updated_at":"2016-07-29T06:47:05Z","closed_at":"2016-07-29T06:42:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a9e3b8a5508b0621420df5f864b4754c151ec13b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1225/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1225/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1225/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/ebad0905783d172df947c4484540fabdb7559ea7","head":{"label":"corneadoug:ZEPPELIN-1229","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1229","sha":"ebad0905783d172df947c4484540fabdb7559ea7","user":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33177730,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzE3NzczMA==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"corneadoug/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"corneadoug","id":710411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMDQxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/710411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug","html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/corneadoug/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/corneadoug/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nAdded a 2D [Esri map](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/) as a graph option for paragraphs. This makes it easier to visualize relations in geographical data.\nPins are plotted at points in specified longitude/latitude columns and customizable column values are shown when pins are clicked. Is this of interest?\n\nThe angular-esri-map module is used, which is released under the Apache 2.0 license, and the JavaScript API is free to use (see [https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/](https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/)).\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1220](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1220)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nExecute a query in a paragraph and select the map pin from the chart type selector.\nSet the longitude/latitude (and optionally, pin info) columns, then interact with the map.\n### Screenshot\n\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9356790/16997359/1262d786-4e83-11e6-8230-a906fe1da2e9.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? **yes.** For angular-esri-map.\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? **no**\n- Does this needs documentation? **potentially.** This feature follows the same layout as the other visualization modes, so users will likely be able to use it easily. However, screenshots of some supported visualizations modes are present in the current documentation. If this PR is merged, it may be desirable to display the map option as well. Interestingly the scatter chart is not included in screenshots in the documentation.\n","created_at":"2016-07-20T18:06:26Z","updated_at":"2017-05-08T16:07:14Z","closed_at":"2016-08-17T05:42:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e58793387e603ab5817cc2abfac36ef71c259b7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1210/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1210/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1210/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/f21ae26857951bb1e5c3ec60655891a5d59abb37","head":{"label":"mwpenny:esri","ref":"esri","sha":"f21ae26857951bb1e5c3ec60655891a5d59abb37","user":{"login":"mwpenny","id":9356790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTY3OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9356790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny","html_url":"https://github.com/mwpenny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63799663,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5OTY2Mw==","name":"zeppelin-esri","full_name":"mwpenny/zeppelin-esri","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mwpenny","id":9356790,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkzNTY3OTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9356790?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny","html_url":"https://github.com/mwpenny","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mwpenny/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mwpenny/zeppelin-esri","description":"Zeppelin
