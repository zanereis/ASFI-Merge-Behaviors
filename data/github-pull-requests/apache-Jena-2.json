issue resolved #2828\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nRemove the code for validating datatypes that according to the RDF 1.1 spec SHOULD NOT be used: QName, ENTITY, ID, IDREF, NOTATION, ENTITIES, NMTOKENS, IDREFS. Also remove code for validating XSD lists and unions. This should not change the behavior of Jena for users, unless they were relying on it to validate their weird XML data, which I don't think is an official functionality of Jena.\r\n\r\nThis is the first step to resolving #2828 – first I wanted to focus on untangling the unneeded the logic. In future PRs, I will remove all the dead code.\r\n\r\nAfter applying these changes, the size of the jena-core JAR was reduced by 13 489 bytes. Not huge, but still something.\r\n\r\nDetails:\r\n\r\n- `XSDDatatype`\r\n    - Removed commented-out datatype definitions for ENTITIES, NMTOKENS, IDREFS.\r\n    - Removed some other commented-out temporary code that was supposed to be cleaned up some time ago (I guess).\r\n    - I left in the registered datatypes for QName, ENTITY, ID, IDREF, NOTATION, because they are not doing any harm here.\r\n- `XSSimpleType`\r\n    - Removed method `isIdType()` along with its implementations (was unused).\r\n    - Removed method `getPrimitiveKind()` along with its implementations (was unused).\r\n- `XSSimpleTypeDecl`\r\n    - Removed the registration of type validators for: QName, ENTITY, ID, IDREF, NOTATION.\r\n    - Removed validation code for these datatypes.\r\n    - Removed all code related to XSD unions and lists (not needed in RDF). Notably, this left atomic types as the only possible types, which greatly reduced the number of branches.\r\n    - *Note:* there was some weirdness in the code where anySimpleType was treated as NOTATION for some reason. I have untangled this. I think any changes to this won't matter anyway, because neither NOTATION nor xsd:anySimpleType make particular sense in RDF.\r\n- `XSSimpleTypeDefinition`\r\n    - Removed constants VARIETY_UNION, VARIETY_LIST.\r\n    - Removed methods related to handling lists and unions.\r\n- `BaseSchemaDVFactory` and `FullDVFactory`\r\n    - Replaced the code for: QName, ENTITY, ID, IDREF, NOTATION, ENTITIES, NMTOKENS, IDREFS with dummy registrations. We still need to register something for these datatypes here, because this is used by `XSDDatatype` in a public interface.\r\n    - Removed the code for XSD lists and unions.\r\n- `BaseDVFactory` and `SchemaDVFactory`\r\n    - Removed the code for XSD lists and unions.\r\n- Removed validator classes (now unused): IDDV, IDREFDV, EntityDV, ListDV, UnionDV\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are

quick YAML version (knew it was probably broken, doesn't matter as I wanted to add it to my `main`)\r\n- Pushed it to `kinow/jena`'s `main`\r\n- Then [created  PR](https://github.com/kinow/jena/pull/36) to fix it, which now could be used to validate it worked\r\n- 8 commits later, got it to work, tests took 1 min e2e, and 2 min the unit (because e2e is pure `yarn`, but for unit I used `mvn` -- just to make sure UI is not broken when Maven is used?)\r\n- Squashed, cherry-picked the commit from this PR to prepare this PR\r\n- Added the `if` to check for `apache/jena` as the repository\r\n\r\nNow once this is merged we can rebase a dependabot or some other UI PR and :crossed_fingers: it will work.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34809fcf-a7f4-4e68-9a04-829f71016be7)\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [ ] Tests are included.\r\n - [ ] Documentation change and updates are

issue resolved #2821\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n* Fixed inconsistent context handling in the update builder machinery and made it consistent with that in the query builder machinery.\r\n* The context of update requests is now forwarded to the query execution\r\n* `UpdateEngineWorker` sets the remaining query timeout if the newly introduced `ARQ.updateTimeout` has been set. Note, that it is possible to set an initial timeout via the `ARQ.updateTimeout` from which internally an `ARQ.queryTimeout` setting is derived: An update request would abort if the corresponding query execution timed out on the initial timeout - so only updates with a `WHERE` clause are affected.\r\n* I did not add `initialTimeout` methods to the update exec builders because perhaps initial timeout on updates are a bit to specific for the general interface - opinions?\r\n* Added `UpdateProcessor.getContext()` for consistency with `QueryExec`. This is for discussion.\r\n* Added `UpdateProcessor.abort()` which can abort the underlying query execution if it is based on `QueryIterator`.\r\n* Added test cases to the `TestUpdateExecutionCancel` class.\r\n* For HTTP-based updates, the overall update timeout is forwarded to the existing HTTP machinery.\r\n* There is now a class `TestSPARQLProtocolTimeout` which tests setting the timeout on the update builder.\r\n* `QueryIteratorBase.requestingCancel` was updated to check the `Thread.interrupted()` so that when Fuseki gets shut down (e.g. during unit testing) then any threads still busy executing queries can cancel execution in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Added query/update tests that register a local function that checks for the availability of the cancel signal. Please also see the [test cases](https://github.com/apache/jena/pull/2822/files#diff-6463c230248848118801cb3a1a78ab22f0f9103de53bd812c87e916d1bfc1805R240) which register the function that checks for the cancel signal in three ways for both queries and updates:\r\n\r\n    1. via query/update builder.set\r\n    2. via query/update builder.context\r\n    3. via query/update exec.getContext()\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key commit messages start with the

issue resolved #2808\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\n- Added implementations for `org.apache.jena.datatypes.BaseDatatype#equals` and `#hashCode` based on `RDFDatatype.getURI`, aligning with the principle: \"Same URI, same datatype\" for RDF datatypes.\r\n-  Added corresponding tests in `org.apache.jena.datatypes.TestDatatypes` to verify equality and hash code behavior.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - no Documentation change and no updates are needed for the [Apache Jena website](https://github.com/apache/jena-site/)\r\n - [x] Commits

issue resolved #2800\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new module jena-iri3986 as a new IRIProvider for Jena.\r\n\r\n* Parsing N-triples when calling RDFParser is now by default consistently free of warnings for ill-advised (syntax correct but with URI scheme violation). Jena has been inconsistent. `riot` defaults to checking, as before.\r\n* [RFC 8089](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8089) - the `file:` URI scheme.\r\n* Error and waring messages change\r\n* URNs:\r\n  * Add support and checking of [RFC 8141 URN Components](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8141.html#section-2.3)\r\n  * Support and validate certain URN namespaces, \"uuid\" and \"oid\".\r\n  * \r\n\r\nBug fix: URN resolution. Jena 5.2.0 does not resolve URNs according to IRI path rules (this mainly affects Jena's tests that used `urn:x-hp:eg/` - tests have been changed to use `urn:example:`\r\nAs IRI components, URN `urn:nid:nss` has no authority (hostname) and an IRI path of \"nid:nss\". If it includes a `/` the base resolution rules should respect the path component.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not make `jena-iri3986` active. The default is `jena-iri`.\r\n\r\nFor experimentation - activate with one of:\r\n1. Set environment variable `JENA_IRIPROVIDER=IRI3986` (the jena-iri prodice is called `IRI0`).\r\n2. Set system property when start the JVM `-Djena.iriprovider=IRI8986`, or set in code and call `SystemIRIx.reset()` (any existing `IRIx` are not affected).\r\n\r\nCommand line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nenv

The `registerDatatype` method is left as-is, to allow for overriding datatype registrations if someone really wants to.\r\n\r\nI've added some notes to `registerDatatype` and `unregisterDatatype` that

1.79.5</h2>\n<p>To install Sass 1.79.5, download one of the packages below and <a href=\"https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/\">add it to your PATH</a>, or see <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/install\">the Sass website</a> for full installation instructions.</p>\n<h1>Changes</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Changes to how <code>selector.unify()</code> and <code>@extend</code> combine selectors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The relative order of pseudo-classes (like <code>:hover</code>) and pseudo-elements   (like <code>::before</code>) within each original selector is now preserved when   they're combined.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pseudo selectors are now consistently placed at the end of the combined   selector, regardless of which selector they came from. Previously, this   reordering only applied to pseudo-selectors in the second selector.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tweak the color transformation matrices for OKLab and OKLCH to match the newer, more accurate values in the CSS spec.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix a slight inaccuracy case when converting to <code>srgb-linear</code> and <code>display-p3</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Potentially breaking bug fix:</strong> <code>math.unit()</code> now wraps multiple denominator units in parentheses. For example, <code>px/(em*em)</code> instead of <code>px/em*em</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Command-Line Interface</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>@parcel/watcher</code> to watch the filesystem when running from JavaScript and not using <code>--poll</code>. This should mitigate more frequent failures users have been seeing since version 4.0.0 of Chokidar, our previous watching tool, was released.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JS API</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix <code>SassColor.interpolate()</code> to allow an undefined <code>options</code> parameter, as the types indicate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Embedded Sass</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Properly pass missing color channel values to and from custom functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#1795\">full changelog</a> for changes in earlier releases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\">sass's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.79.5</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Changes to how <code>selector.unify()</code> and <code>@extend</code> combine selectors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The relative order of pseudo-classes (like <code>:hover</code>) and pseudo-elements\n(like <code>::before</code>) within each original selector is now preserved when\nthey're combined.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pseudo selectors are now consistently placed at the end of the combined\nselector, regardless of which selector they came from.

issue resolved #2766\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\nDue to Java bytes to string conversion using the JDK conversion, Jena can't tell the difference between multibyte characters translated to surrogates (legal) and surrogates actually in the in UTF-8 (illegal - UTF-8 does not allow surrogates).\r\n\r\nThe test changes are bug fixes. They are detecting warnings on the replacement character but that is explicitly handled, and allowed, controlled by a flag, further up.\r\n\r\nA deep fix might be possible - but it involves our own UTF-8 decoder and will need careful assessment of the performance impact. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate development commit messages.\r\n - [x] Key commit

issue resolved #2767 \r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n\r\n- Fixes grammar/typos\r\n- Fixes variables that are ignored but have a name (instead of using `_`)\r\n- Fixes types that are used but not imported\r\n- Fixes code that uses dependencies that are not declared in our `package.json`\r\n\r\nThis last point is the most important one. We had some code modifying `codemirror`, which comes via Zazuko libs, but we never declared in `package.json`, using only as transitive. Now it's listed in our code as we actually import that code and modify it for our Query component.\r\n\r\nBut the most important change was replacing [`query-string`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string) by [`qs`](https://github.com/ljharb/qs). We had both, in different parts of the code, but luckily we had unit tests covering that, so replacing was really easy and doesn't seem to break anything.\r\n\r\nChoosing between the two was not straightforward as none is maintained by a big community or known company. After some searching, and comparing usage & downloads, looks like qs has a larger user base, and since its description mentions \"security\", I thought it'd be OK to keep that one and drop `query-string` (which might still be used in Zazuko components... although looks like they also have `qs` somewhere in their other transitive dependencies -- JS dependencies are complicated :sighs:)\r\n\r\n- https://npm-compare.com/qs,query-string\r\n- https://npm-compare.com/qs,query-string,querystring,url-parse\r\n\r\nI grouped each change into separate commits so that I can revert/drop any if needed.

how Fuseki arguments are customised, in particular makes the `ServerConfig` class public adding the ability to store extra configuration on it.\r\n\r\nIt also changes the previously `private static applyServerArgs()` method into a protected instance method so users can extend `FusekiMain` and override it to use that to customise the `FusekiServer.Builder` further.\r\n\r\nUnit tests are added that validate that custom arguments can now be passed through CLI inputs and used to influence the Server being built.\r\n\r\nGitHub issue resolved #2753\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are

#2740\r\n\r\nPull request Description:\r\n- added \"public Node createURI(IRIx iriX, ...);\" to the ParserProfile, which simply uses the given IRI instead of resolving it again.\r\n- adding general IRIx caching (org.apache.jena.atlas.lib.cache.CacheSimple) in the parsers where the already cached org.apache.jena.riot.system.ParserProfileStd#resolver is not applicable\r\n- removed unused code and variables from ParserRRX_StAX_SR and ParserRRX_StAX_EV\r\n- added `org.apache.jena.riot.lang.rdfxml.TestXMLParser` in jena-benchmarks-jmh\r\n\r\n\r\nBenchmark results:\r\n```\r\nBenchmark

issue resolved #2715\r\n\r\nThis PR contains changes to TokenizerText, used by the usual Turtle, TriG, N-Triples and N-Quads parsers\r\n\r\n* Fix for #2715 parsing numbers with sign and no integer digits\r\n* Adds the tokens for RDF 1.2 triple terms . The exact form of these tokens may well change but the fact new tokens are being added looks quite likely. \r\n* Some tidying up of the code.\r\n\r\nThe RDF 1.2 tokens are not used by parsers on the main branch.\r\nRDF 1.2 development is not on `main`.\r\n\r\nThe tokenzier changes are close together in a one particular area of code. It makes keeping the separate development streams messy - rebase/merge keeps confliciting.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n - [x] Tests are included.\r\n - [x] Commits have been squashed to remove intermediate

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>1.79.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>No user-visible changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>1.79.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Breaking change</strong>: Passing a number with unit <code>%</code> to the <code>$alpha</code> parameter\nof <code>color.change()</code>, <code>color.adjust()</code>, <code>change-color()</code>, and <code>adjust-color()</code>\nis now interpreted as a percentage, instead of ignoring the unit. For example,\n<code>color.change(red, $alpha: 50%)</code> now returns <code>rgb(255 0 0 / 0.5)</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Potentially breaking compatibility fix</strong>: Sass no longer rounds RGB channels\nto the nearest integer. This means that, for example, <code>rgb(0 0 1) != rgb(0 0 0.6)</code>. This matches the latest version of the CSS spec and browser behavior.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Potentially breaking compatibility fix</strong>: Passing large positive or negative\nvalues to <code>color.adjust()</code> can now cause a color's channels to go outside that\ncolor's gamut. In most cases this will currently be clipped by the browser and\nend up showing the same color as before, but once browsers implement gamut\nmapping it may produce a different result.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add support for CSS Color Level 4 [color spaces]. Each color value now tracks\nits color space along with the values of each channel in that color space.\nThere are two general principles to keep in mind when dealing with new color\nspaces:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>With the exception of legacy color spaces (<code>rgb</code>, <code>hsl</code>, and <code>hwb</code>), colors\nwill always be emitted in the color space they were defined in unless\nthey're explicitly converted.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>color.to-space()</code> function is the only way to convert a color to\nanother color space. Some built-in functions may do operations in a\ndifferent color space, but they'll always convert back to the original space\nafterwards.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>rgb</code> colors can now have non-integer channels and channels outside the normal\ngamut of 0-255. These colors are always emitted using the <code>rgb()</code> syntax so\nthat modern browsers that are being displayed on wide-gamut devices can\ndisplay the most accurate color possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add support for all the new color syntax defined in Color Level 4, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>oklab()</code>, <code>oklch()</code>, <code>lab()</code>, and <code>lch()</code> functions;</li>\n<li>a top-level <code>hwb()</code> function that matches the space-separated CSS syntax;</li>\n<li>and a <code>color()</code> function that supports the <code>srgb</code>, <code>srgb-linear</code>,\n<code>display-p3</code>, <code>a98-rgb</code>, <code>prophoto-rgb</code>, <code>rec2020</code>, <code>xyz</code>, <code>xyz-d50</code>, and\n<code>xyz-d65</code> color spaces.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add new functions for working with color spaces:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
