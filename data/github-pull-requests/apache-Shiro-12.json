href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF.

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1543\">#1543</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.4 - 10 Feb 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.3 - 08 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.2. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1518\">#1518</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.2 - 06 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug that forced the <code>init</code> Action to run for at least two minutes on JavaScript. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1494\">#1494</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.39 - 18 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeQL Action v1 is now deprecated, and is no longer updated or supported.

removed or deprecated features for <strong>Hazelcast Platform 5.2.2</strong> release. The numbers in square brackets refer to the pull requests in Hazelcast's GitHub repository.</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the default cloud coordinator URL from <code>coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code> to <code>api.viridian.hazelcast.com</code>.\nWhen you use the default configuration, it now connects to Hazelcast Viridian instead of Hazelcast Cloud, potentially leading to not being able to connect to the cloud cluster. If you want to use Hazelcast Cloud, you need to change the value of <code>hazelcast.client.cloud.url</code> property to <code>https://coordinator.hazelcast.cloud</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23304\">#23304</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/10/amazon-machine-images-support-instance-metadata-service-version-2-default/#:~:text=Posted%20On%3A%20Oct%203%2C%202022,depth%20against%20unauthorized%20metadata%20access.\">IMDSv2</a> for Hazelcast's AWS Discovery plugin.</li>\n<li>Hazelcast now allows serializing unsupported types via xref:serialization:compact-serialization.adoc#using-compact-serialization-with-zero-configuration[zero-configuration] provided that there is an explicit serializer implemented for the unsupported type. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23569\">#23569</a></li>\n<li>Added <code>flock</code> to guard concurrent <code>pip</code> runs. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22934\">#22934</a></li>\n<li>Added the ability of discovering ECS and EC2 clients by the Hazelcast members on Amazon ECS. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22630\">#22630</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where excessive amount of Kubernetes API calls were being logged when Automatic State Management feature is enabled in a Hazelcast cluster running on Kubernetes. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23576\">#23576</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the JSON Query results were inconsistent, using the data stored as JSON via <code>HazelcastJsonValue</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23453\">#23453</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the unordered <code>mapUsingServiceAsync()</code> was losing the last items when there are no watermarks. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23272\">#23272</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the message of an exception caused when reading a JDBC table column metadata was showing the data source reference instead of the table name. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23123\">#23123</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the recorded moment of submitted job's start time was causing a race condition.\nFor short jobs, the job might have been completed even before recording the <code>startTime</code> metric; since this metric is collected after the job is submitted.\nNow, this metric is collected just before submitting a job. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23066\">#23066</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the offloading of map stores (which is enabled by default) was leading to unexpected unlocking behavior when committing transactions. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/22937\">#22937</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/cee307fcf045371569ec6249ace391ff34b53ce7\"><code>cee307f</code></a> Upgrade version to 5.2.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/a221adc3f62eb9f45b3757ebbd2220754e846de1\"><code>a221adc</code></a> [CN-714] Add AWS IMDSv2 cluster to phonehome [5.2.2] (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23636\">#23636</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/3bf9b8e3dcb0d6e435cc16b882be67a99f008ac9\"><code>3bf9b8e</code></a> Typo fix.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/763137843eb45ad9851b1454e0f546625050ca45\"><code>7631378</code></a> Added RN for Platform OS 5.2.2.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/4c6ab001e6f6480e67b52734ab7d8b5feb69954e\"><code>4c6ab00</code></a> Prepare release 5.2.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/852f83dedc0c41989de6fae58114c27f9e83cdf1\"><code>852f83d</code></a> [CN-714] Add support of IMDSv2 for AWS Discovery plugin (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23591\">#23591</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/3ee49cbb0927101c79e043fd7453e552704ba95c\"><code>3ee49cb</code></a> Run step if met with preconditions (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23566\">#23566</a>) [5.2.z] (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23583\">#23583</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/af032b312bc7d88f399bc4dac8650da5dd816ce4\"><code>af032b3</code></a> Enhance error handling in KubernetesClient [5.2.z] (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23576\">#23576</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/cd3150703b0b6f9eba715759af80bdf207eef0a4\"><code>cd31507</code></a> [5.2.z] Allow serializing an unsupported type with reflective serializer if t...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/a43b66809cad8db3a54737d2026e4b3e6091370d\"><code>a43b668</code></a> Do not process JoinMessages from left members [HZ-1713] [5.2.z] (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/23502\">#23502</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/compare/v5.2.1...v5.2.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.hazelcast:hazelcast&package-manager=maven&previous-version=5.2.1&new-version=5.2.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug that forced the <code>init</code> Action to run for at least two minutes on JavaScript. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1494\">#1494</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.39 - 18 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeQL Action v1 is now deprecated, and is no longer updated or supported. For better performance, improved security, and new features, upgrade to v2. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-18-code-scanning-codeql-action-v1-is-now-deprecated/\">this changelog post</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1466\">#1467</a></li>\n<li>Python automatic dependency installation will no longer fail for projects using Poetry that specify <code>virtualenvs.options.no-pip = true</code> in their <code>poetry.toml</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1431\">#1431</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing a stack trace and error message when the action fails to find the SHA at the\ncurrent directory. This will happen in several non-error states and so we now avoid cluttering the\nlog with this message. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1485\">#1485</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.38 - 12 Jan 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.3 - 08 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.2. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1518\">#1518</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.2 - 06 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug that forced the <code>init</code> Action to run for at least two minutes on JavaScript. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1494\">#1494</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.39 - 18 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeQL Action v1 is now deprecated, and is no longer updated or supported. For better performance, improved security, and new features, upgrade to v2. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-18-code-scanning-codeql-action-v1-is-now-deprecated/\">this changelog post</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1466\">#1467</a></li>\n<li>Python automatic dependency installation will no longer fail for projects using Poetry that specify <code>virtualenvs.options.no-pip = true</code> in their <code>poetry.toml</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1431\">#1431</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing a stack trace and error message when the action fails to find the SHA at the\ncurrent directory. This will happen in several non-error states and so we now avoid cluttering the\nlog with this message. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1485\">#1485</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.38 - 12 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.0. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1466\">#1466</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.37 - 14 Dec 2022</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.</p>\n<h2>Enhancements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduced a system property for allowing you to audit that all the Hazelcast instances running in your\nenvironment have the instance tracking file name set correctly in the configuration. See the note in Instance Tracking documentation. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19929\">#19929</a></li>\n<li>Enabled XXE (XML External Entity Reference) protection for <code>XMLInputFactory</code>.

If you want to see these statistics, you need to set the &quot;hazelcast.metrics.debug.enabled&quot; property to &quot;true. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21275\">#21275</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the statistics like puts and removals were not increasing when these operations are executed through Transactional interface. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/21105\">#21105</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where Hazelcast clients, which have only the IP address of a member to connect (but the member also has a hostname), were not able to connect to the cluster. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/20631\">#20631</a></li>\n<li>Hazelcast’s memcached implementation was interpreting the number values and parameters for <code>incr</code> and <code>decr</code> wrongly (numbers were being converted into byte arrays instead of decimals).\nThis has been fixed by making these commands' implementations strictly follow the memcached protocol specification. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19676\">#19676</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the <code>totalPublishes</code> statistics for the Reliable Topic data structure were always generated as <code>0</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19656\">#19656</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where the <code>map.clear</code> and <code>cache.clear</code> methods were evicting all entries in all near caches of all the maps in a cluster, not only the map on which these methods are called. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/19501\">#19501</a></li>\n<li>Fixed an issue where map entries were never evicted or expired:\n** Let's say you have a map whose entries have both time-to-live and maximum idle durations configured.\n** You are periodically reading the entries at times shorter than these durations.\nIn this case, the entries were not evicted or expired according to their time-to-live or maximum idle duration configurations.\nYou can set the <code>per-entry-stats-enabled</code> property to <code>true</code> to fix this.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.2 - 06 Feb 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an issue where customers using the CodeQL Action with the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.7/admin/code-security/managing-github-advanced-security-for-your-enterprise/configuring-code-scanning-for-your-appliance#configuring-codeql-analysis-on-a-server-without-internet-access\">CodeQL Action sync tool</a> would not be able to obtain the CodeQL tools. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1517\">#1517</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.1 - 27 Jan 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.0 - 26 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve stability when choosing the default version of CodeQL to use in code scanning workflow runs on Actions on GitHub.com. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1475\">#1475</a>\n<ul>\n<li>This change addresses customer reports of code scanning alerts on GitHub.com being closed and reopened during the rollout of new versions of CodeQL in the GitHub Actions <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/runner-images\">runner images</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>No change is required for the majority of workflows</strong>, including:\n<ul>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners using the latest version (<code>v2</code>) of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action from <code>v2.2.0</code> onwards.</li>\n<li>Workflows on GitHub Enterprise Server.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>A change may be required</strong> for workflows on GitHub.com hosted runners that are pinned to specific versions of the CodeQL Action before <code>v2.2.0</code> (e.g. <code>v2.1.32</code>):\n<ul>\n<li>Previously, these workflows would obtain the latest version of CodeQL from the Actions runner image.</li>\n<li>Now, these workflows will download an older, compatible version of CodeQL from GitHub Releases. To use this older version, no change is required. To use the newest version of CodeQL, please update your workflows to reference the latest version of the CodeQL Action (<code>v2</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Internal changes</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes will not affect the majority of code scanning workflows. Continue reading only if your workflow uses <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/main/packages/tool-cache\"><code>@​actions/tool-cache</code></a> or relies on the precise location of CodeQL within the Actions tool cache.</li>\n<li>The tool cache now contains <strong>two</strong> recent CodeQL versions (previously <strong>one</strong>).</li>\n<li>Each CodeQL version is located under a directory named after the release date and version number, e.g. CodeQL 2.11.6 is now located under <code>CodeQL/2.11.6-20221211/x64/codeql</code> (previously <code>CodeQL/0.0.0-20221211/x64/codeql</code>).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The maximum number of <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/sarif-support-for-code-scanning#run-object\">SARIF runs</a> per file has been increased from 15 to 20 for users uploading SARIF files to GitHub.com. This change will help ensure that Code Scanning can process SARIF files generated by third-party tools that have many runs. See the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning#upload-an-analysis-as-sarif-data\">GitHub API documentation</a> for a list of all the limits around uploading SARIF. This change will be released to GitHub Enterprise Server as part of GHES 3.9.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.12.1. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1498\">#1498</a></li>\n<li>Fix a bug that forced the <code>init</code> Action to run for at least two minutes on JavaScript. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1494\">#1494</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.1.39 - 18 Jan 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CodeQL Action v1 is now deprecated, and is no longer updated or supported. For better performance, improved security, and new features, upgrade to v2. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-18-code-scanning-codeql-action-v1-is-now-deprecated/\">this changelog post</a>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1466\">#1467</a></li>\n<li>Python automatic dependency installation will no longer fail for projects using Poetry that specify <code>virtualenvs.options.no-pip = true</code> in their <code>poetry.toml</code>. <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1431\">#1431</a></li>\n<li>Avoid printing a stack trace and error message when the action fails to find the SHA at the\ncurrent directory.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-07T06:56:45Z","updated_at":"2023-02-07T09:50:59Z","closed_at":"2023-02-07T09:50:55Z","merged_at":"2023-02-07T09:50:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"fac85b8b7518d226c93995371464d092becc33c5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/720/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/720/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/issues/720/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/statuses/860b39f10d5a9ff0fc59d95f5338677a5d105673","head":{"label":"apache:coheigea/maven","ref":"coheigea/maven","sha":"860b39f10d5a9ff0fc59d95f5338677a5d105673","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":291570,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTE1NzA=","name":"shiro","full_name":"apache/shiro","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/shiro","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\r\n\r\n - [x] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n - [x] In any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

https://www.apache.org/security/\r\n-->\r\n\r\nFollowing this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

Summary\n\nThis pull request is created by [Secure Workflows](https://app.stepsecurity.io/securerepo) at the request of @coheigea. Please merge the Pull Request to incorporate the requested changes. Please tag @coheigea on your message if you have any questions related to the PR. You can also engage with the [StepSecurity](https://github.com/step-security) team by tagging @step-security-bot.\n\n## Security Fixes\n\n### Least Privileged GitHub Actions Token Permissions\n\nThe least privilged token permissions were calculate using [Secure WorkFlows](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows) based on the actions included in the GitHub Workflow files. This is recommended by GitHub as well as The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF).\n\n- [GitHub Security Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow)\n- [The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Security Guide](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#token-permissions)\n### Pinned Dependencies\n\nA *pinned dependency* is a dependency that is explicitly set to a specific hashed version instead of a mutable version. Pinned dependencis ensure that development and deployment are done with the same software versions which reduces deployment risks, and enables reproducibility. It can help mitigate compromised dependencies from undermining the security of the project in certain scenarios. The dependencies were pinned using [Secure WorkFlows](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows)\n\n- [GitHub Security Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions)\n- [The Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Security Guide](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies)\n\n\n## Feedback\nFor bug reports, feature requests, and general feedback; please create an issue in [step-security/secure-workflows](https://github.com/step-security/secure-workflows).

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \n \nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\n \nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\n\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\nyou have to acknowledge this by using the following check-box.\n\n - [ ] I hereby declare this contribution to be licenced under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n - [ ] In any other case, please file an

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [ ] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [ ] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO) filed \r\n       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not \r\n       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes.\r\n - [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[SHIRO-XXX] - Fixes bug in SessionManager`,\r\n       where you replace `SHIRO-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. Best practice\r\n       is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and in the first line of the commit message.\r\n - [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n - [x] Run `mvn clean install apache-rat:check` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.\r\n - [x] If you have a group of commits related to the same change, please squash your commits into one and force push your branch using `git rebase -i`. \r\n \r\nTrivial changes like typos do not require a JIRA issue (javadoc, comments...). \r\nIn this case, just format the pull request title like `(DOC) - Add javadoc in SessionManager`.\r\n \r\nIf this is your first contribution, you have to read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/shiro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\nIf your pull request is about ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf) \r\nif you are unsure please ask on the developers list.\r\n\r\nTo make clear that you license your contribution under the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\nyou have to acknowledge this by using

any other case, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf).\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-28T01:54:27Z","updated_at":"2023-02-06T20:08:03Z","closed_at":"2023-02-06T20:07:59Z","merged_at":"2023-02-06T20:07:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"64a87a8318af437961805b248849c2265d8cac7b","assignee":{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lprimak","id":1002484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak","html_url":"https://github.com/lprimak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lprimak/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bdemers","id":99954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers","html_url":"https://github.com/bdemers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bdemers/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bmarwell","id":1413391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MTMzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1413391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell","html_url":"https://github.com/bmarwell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bmarwell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2618599219,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjE4NTk5MjE5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/labels/shiro-2.0.0","name":"shiro-2.0.0","color":"F155AA","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4619657872,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAARy8s8AAAABE1pikA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/shiro/labels/java","name":"java","color":"ffa221","default":false,"description":"Pull
