filters all DAGs by case-insensitive pattern-matching of the provided task_id.\r\n* suggestions of task_ids are automatically shown when typing. Since the same task_id can be present in many dags, an italic \" in <dag_id>\" is shown following the task_id suggestion.\r\n* actively limit the DAG search scope by prefixing \"dag:\" for dag_id

running tests in v2-8-tests some of the tests failed with package-name key not found in providers manager. This was because some other tests modified dictionaries stored in ProvidersManager and added there entries that missed the keys.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a a new fixture `cleanup_providers_manager` - that will reinitialize the ProvidersManager before the test and - more importantly will clean it up after. This way all the entries added manually should be removed for other tests and all the tests that do not explicitly initialize providers manager should fail if they need it.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Sdist packages have been broken by #37340 and fixed by 37388, but we have not noticed it because CI check for sdist packages has been broken since #36537 where we standardized naming of the sdist packages to follow modern syntax (and we silently skipped installation because no providers were found),.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it:\r\n\r\n* changes the naming format expected to follow the new standard\r\n* treats \"no providers found as error\"\r\n\r\nThe \"no providers\" as success was useful at some point of time when we run sdist as part of regular PRs and some PRs resulted in \"no providers changed\" condition, however sdist verification only happens now in canary build (so all providers are affected) as well as we have if condition in the job itself to skip the step of installation if there are no providers.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PROD cachie build often fails (especially in v2-8-test) when it tries to rebuild the PROD cache in parallel on ARM. There is some weird inter-buildx problem with it and some people experience it sometimes as documented in https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/2367\r\n\r\nInstead of finding the root cause, we change this specific job in CI to run sequentially. This changes the time it will take to update cache - but not as much as 4x because the builds do not parallelise very well anyway. Likely instead of 8m we will get maybe total 15m, and since this is just cache update after everything else has completed, it does not matter too much if it runs a little longer.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

But,  Google provider --> BigQueryHook  inherits the DbApiHook. Is it necessary that insert_rows ([link](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/c020fbd360663607463083cae8528dd1c8dc4281/airflow/providers/google/cloud/hooks/bigquery.py#L228) to the def) defined in an inherited class to have same signature?

changes in #37320 introduced flakiness while removing side-effect of configuration test. Cleanup of ProvidersManager might interfere with other tests using it at the same time. This caused some Non-DB test failures with missing keys in ProvidersManager.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to mark the configuration test as DB-test - then it will never be run by NonDB xdist and it will always run sequentially to other tests (and still it will not introduce side-effect as cleanup will always be done between tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The changes include the implementation of batch processing to efficiently handle large sets of DAG IDs. The motivation behind this change is to address the performance issues associated with processing a large number of DAGs, which can lead to significant memory usage and slow down the scheduler.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Batch Processing: The method now processes `DatasetDagRunQueue` records in batches, reducing memory usage and improving efficiency. This approach minimizes the overhead of loading and processing large numbers of DAGs simultaneously.\r\n- Error Handling: Improved the handling of cases where DAG serialization versions are outdated or when no dataset trigger records are found for a given DAG. \r\n\r\n_Depends on the merge of PR apache/airflow#37016._ and #37101\r\n\r\n## Dependency Checklist\r\n- [x] PR #37016 should be merged

an 'elif' block in the 'async def run(self)' method of 'TemplateJobStartTrigger', which captures 'JOB_STATE_CANCELLED'. This prevents the triggerer from looping indefinitely when a dataflow is cancelled. This also required updating the 'execute_complete' method of both 'DataflowStartFlexTemplateOperator' and 'DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator', which now raise an 'AirflowException(event[\"message\"])' when the job has the status \"cancelled\". So, if you cancel the job in the Google console, this will be reflected in the Airflow task execution.\r\n\r\nAdded 'pool_sleep' as an optional argument to the constructor of 'DataflowStartFlexTemplateOperator', preserving its default value of 10 seconds. This argument is passed to the 'TemplateJobStartTrigger' constructor when the 'self.defer' method is called in 'execute'.\r\n\r\nAdded tests to TemplateJobStartTrigger, DataflowStartFlexTemplateOperator and DataflowTemplatedJobStartOperator.","created_at":"2024-02-12T15:10:26Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T00:11:47Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T00:11:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6bdc6b95837ab240484a2745c1836bf578607685","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37279 I introduce periodic logging of the container.\r\nDuring the process, I also changed a few event Dict key names\r\nand that is problematic for someone

also emit an event even if the pod is in the pod intermediate state.\r\none reported issue: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/37279#issuecomment-1938757838\r\nIn this PR I'm restoring the trigger

regular dependencies change we enable UPGRADE_TO_NEWER_DEPENDENCIES flag. After some recent improvements in installing dependencies from the branch tip where we can install airflow using `[devel-ci]` extra from the branch tip, this opens up another option for speeding up the installations, when some dependencies change.\r\n\r\nSo far - UPGRADE_TO_NEWER_DEPENDENCIES necessitated to reinstall all dependencies with airflow attempting to upgrade them eagerly. This takes ~ 28 minutes on CI now from the scratch. However, this is not needed. We can still start from the set of dependencies pre-installed by installation from branch tip, and only trigger\r\n\"UPGRADE_TO_NEWER_DEPENDENCIES\" after that - so that the \"URL\" installation cache does not get invalidated.\r\n\r\nThis should limit the time needed to build such an image to ~ 8 minutes in CI when cache is built.\r\n\r\nIn the future we might further optimize it - as we now have all the mechanisms necessary to do that in selective checks. For example we could trigger UPGRADE_TO_NEWER_DEPENDENCIES only when some dependencies are changes, and not when new dependencies are added, further limiting the time needed to build such image to some ~ 3/4 minutes. But this should be a separate PR and should be carefuly thought about, as it might also be that this will lead to conflicts with the latest constraints..\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PR is not intended to be merged, and some CI checks will likely fail. \r\n\r\nI'm a Ruff maintainer working on the 2024 style guide, which we plan to stabilize in the next minor release. You can read about all formatting changes in https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/9945 but the goal of this PR is that you don't have to and instead can look at how the new style guide changes **your** code. \r\n\r\nI'd like to hear if there are any changes you don't like (or particularly like) so we can fine-tune the formatting or remove the style from the upcoming release. Feel free to comment on the above discussion or leave feedback on this PR. I'm happy to comment on the discussion with a summary of your feedback. \r\n\r\nFeel free to close the PR if you don't feel like providing feedback right now. \r\n\r\nYou can reproduce the changes in this PR by building the latest version of `ruff` from the source and running it with `ruff format --preview` (the latest stable release of ruff should give you very similar results)\r\n\r\nI reviewed (most) changes, and most style changes are due to one of the following new styles:\r\n\r\n* [`module_docstring_newlines`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/9945#discussioncomment-8439787): Adds a blank line after the module docstring\r\n* [`dummy_implementations`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/9945#discussioncomment-8439783): Collapses dummy implementations (functions or classes with a `...` body)\r\n* [`hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/9945#discussioncomment-8439722): Lists, tuples, and dictionaries are now *hugged* when they're the only argument in a call expression.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few changes due to [`prefer_splitting_right_hand_side_of_assignments`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/9945#discussioncomment-8439741) mainly because the comment handling is now slightly different.\r\n\r\n[This gist](https://gist.github.com/MichaReiser/3ac4ed578c1687cf5b2a01b3b1dbd9a7) is a diff of the changes without `module_docstring_newlines`, ` dummy_implementations`, and `hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets`] to reduce the noise by a bit ;)\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

is the next step of optimization of image caching. Since we\r\ndo not have regular devel-* dependencies in the \"wheel\" installation any\r\nmore, when we are using it to install from branch tip, we really\r\ninstalled plain airflow with no dependencies. This did not improve\r\ncaching speed too much. Instead we now have a special (not advertised)\r\ndevel-ci extra that consists of all 3rd-party dependencies we can have\r\nfor Airflow - both development and production.\r\n\r\nThis will bring much better optimisation in case pyproject.toml changes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

been internally using pydantic for internal API and it caused some compatibility issues, because Pydantic is so popular and currently still users of Pydantic are somewhat split between Pydantic 1 and Pydantic 2.  The popularity of Pydantic works against us, and since we are not yet using it in \"production\" (and in the future we will only actually use it for Internal API), it seems that turning Pydantic into an optional dependency is the best way we can proceed.\r\n\r\nIt's as simple as converting all the direct imports into a common util imports that have a fallback mechanism when import is not found.\r\n\r\nThis should enable less conflicts when installing 3rd-party libraries with Airflow.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

of the recent changes in handling conflicting dependencies broke optimization of installing dependencies from branch tip.\r\n\r\nThe optimisation worked in the way that it installed packages first from branch tip, to make them pre-installed (and cached in docker layer) so that final installatin step with pyproject.toml takes very little time, even if it is changed.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that in case branch tip and constraints conflicted, the installation failed and effectively no packages were installed in the \"branch tip\" layer, effectively removing the cache.\r\n\r\nThis change fixes it - when we install from branch tip now we are not using constraints, which means that they will never conflict, and this also means that cache will never be empty. It can contain other versions of some of the packages, but vast majority of the packages shoudo be the same as in constraints, so the following installation step should reuse vast majority of already installed packages.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

dependencies change in pyproject.toml, we should run build\r\nwith `upgrade-to-newer-dependencies`, however we should not run\r\nit when dependencies in pyproject.toml do not change.\r\n\r\nThat saves about 30 minutes of elapsed time of the build and heavily\r\nlimits the number of tests executed. It takes about 30 minutes now\r\nto build the image that has \"upgrade-to-newer-dependencies\", we only\r\nusually run default Python image in such case and we do not run many\r\ntests that are not needed (for example K8S tests).\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes out the case where non-dependency changes only are\r\ndone in pyproject.toml. This happens for example when you only change\r\ndocstrings and remove ruff rules in [[tools.ruff]] section.\r\n\r\nWe compare the dependencies and optional dependencies coming from\r\nthe change and only when there is a change in those, we set the\r\n`upgrade-to-newer-dependencies` flag. We also print what changed.\r\n\r\nSimilarly full-tests-needed is only set when build-system changes\r\nor when dependencies change, because then we want to make sure new\r\ndependencies are working on all Python versions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.
