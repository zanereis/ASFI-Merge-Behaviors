for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new configuration, `spark.executor.failureTracker.keepaliveOnMinLiveExecutors.enabled`, which defaults to false.\r\n\r\nWhen false, it fully respects the executor failures counted by ExecutorFailureTracker, and if the count exceeds the maximum number of executor failures, the app will exit forcefully and immediately. Note that this is the behavior we currently have.\r\n\r\nWhen true, if the count exceeds the maximum, we do an extra check to decide whether we shall exit the app directly or not. It checks whether it still has sufficient resources or not based on the `initial executors` * `spark.scheduler.minRegisteredResourcesRatio`. The app continues with sufficient resources and fails if the live executors keep dying, resulting in insufficient resources. If there is no more dying, the app gets the job finished.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe ExecutorFailureTracker is overly sensitive to executor failures and tends to overreact by terminating the application immediately upon reaching the threshold, regardless of whether the current resources obtained are sufficient or not. Since executor allocation depends on various factors such as resource managers, host environments, and external dependencies, it may become unavailable for some time. During this period, ExecutorFailureTracker may accumulate enough failures to mistakenly kill itself.\r\nHere is also an example from our prod,\r\nThe application had been running for hours before suddenly crashed with `Stage cancelled because SparkContext was shut down` and `Max number of executor failures (20) reached`. Meanwhile, it still had 90% of maxNumExecutors and was about to finish. In its final moments (less than 10 seconds), it requested only one additional executor. Well, speaking of the outcomes, it was definitely an incorrect step.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe threshold of ExecutorFailureTracker is inflexible to use. It's pre-configured by `spark.executor.maxNumFailures` or calculated by `2 * max number of executor`. It does not consider the actual numbers of live executors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, new configuation\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nnew unit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-10T06:20:15Z","updated_at":"2024-07-05T09:48:55Z","closed_at":"2024-07-05T09:48:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"df78bbb669b10e2f781e156fe5dfd35f00fae024","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605057,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/KUBERNETES","name":"KUBERNETES","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43746/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43746/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43746/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f83a05aa23b0da211344892c964ceffa2ecec362","head":{"label":"yaooqinn:SPARK-45873","ref":"SPARK-45873","sha":"f83a05aa23b0da211344892c964ceffa2ecec362","user":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":357976080,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTc5NzYwODA=","name":"spark","full_name":"yaooqinn/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yaooqinn","id":8326978,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMjY5Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8326978?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn","html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yaooqinn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yaooqinn/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR includes the following optimizations related to `.toBuffer` in the `connect`s module:\r\n\r\n1. For the two functions `sql(String, java.util.Map[String, Any]): DataFrame` and `sql(String, Array[_]): DataFrame` in `SparkSession`, the approach of using `.find` directly on the `CloseableIterator` to locate the target and utilizing `.foreach` to consume the remaining elements replaced the previous method of converting to a collection using `toBuffer.toSeq` and then searching for the target using `.find`. This approach avoids the need for an unnecessary collection creation.\r\n2. For function `execute(proto.Relation.Builder => Unit): Unit` in `SparkSession`, as no elements are returned, `.foreach` is used instead of `.toBuffer` to avoid an unnecessary collection creation.\r\n3. For function `execute(command: proto.Command): Seq[ExecutePlanResponse]` in `SparkSession`, in Scala 2.12, `s.c.TraversableOnce#toSeq` returns an `immutable.Stream`, which is a tail-lazy structure that may not consume all elements. Therefore, it is necessary to use `s.c.TraversableOnce#toBuffer` for materialization. However, in Scala 2.13, `s.c.IterableOnceOps#toSeq` constructs an `immutable.Seq`, which is not a lazy data structure and ensures consumption of all elements. Therefore, in Scala 2.13, `.toSeq` can be used directly to replace `toBuffer.toSeq`, saving an extra collection transformation.\r\n4. The optimizations for the two functions `listAbandonedExecutions: Seq[ExecuteInfo]` and `listExecuteHolders` in `SparkConnectExecutionManager` are consistent with item 3 above.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, to prevent helper function used for testing from creating copies, a `private[connect]` scope helper function was added to the companion object of `ExecutePlanResponseReattachableIterator`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAvoid unnecessary collection copies\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Action\r\n- Added new test cases to demonstrate that both `.toSeq` and `.foreach` can consume all elements in `ResponseReattachableIterator` in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-11-10T04:52:07Z","updated_at":"2023-11-22T15:09:20Z","closed_at":"2023-11-12T05:45:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"67c62775457a4306089714c88b4cfda479637cc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43745/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43745/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43745/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dadfa5a248c79588d56ed9a5e474db9b8edbd991","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-45871","ref":"SPARK-45871","sha":"dadfa5a248c79588d56ed9a5e474db9b8edbd991","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFixing the canonicalization of build keys in the DynamicPruningSubquery so that build keys are canonicalized relative to build query output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI discovered this issue while working on my other PR for pushing broadcast data of BroadcastHashJoin as a pruning filter. The bug appeared as two DynamicPruningSubquery though equivalent,  on canonicalization, were not matching. It turned out that the build keys expression were getting canonicalized relative to itself, instead of build query 's output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

Note that currently there are totally 57 tests in the Kinesis-asl module, and this PR enabled 35 of them. The remaining tests requires interaction with Amazon Kinesis service which would incur billing costs to users. Hence they are not included in the Github Action.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe significant changes in this PR include:\r\n\r\n- `SparkConnectArtifactManager` is renamed to `ArtifactManager` and moved out of Spark Connect and into `sql/core` (available in `SparkSession` through `SessionState`) along with all corresponding tests and confs.\r\n - While `ArtifactManager` in part of SparkSession, we keep the legacy behaviour for non-connect spark while utilising the ArtifactManager in connect pathways\r\n    - This is done by exposing a new method `withResources` in the artifact manager that sets the context class loader (for driver-side operations) and propagates the `JobArtifactState` such that the resources reach the executor.\r\n    - Spark Connect pathways utilise this method through the `SessionHolder#withActive`\r\n    - When `withResources` is not used, neither the custom context classloader nor the `JobArtifactState` is propagated and hence, non Spark Connect pathways remain with legacy behaviour.  \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe `ArtifactManager` that currently lies in the connect package can be moved into the wider sql/core package (e.g SparkSession) to expand the scope. This is possible because the `ArtifactManager` is tied solely to the `SparkSession#sessionUUID` and hence can be cleanly detached from Spark Connect and be made generally available.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. Existing behaviour is kept intact for both non-connect and connect spark.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-09T15:55:50Z","updated_at":"2023-12-13T11:27:50Z","closed_at":"2023-11-21T01:39:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f7b98b12c7eb0281e4c012f15437e434e4e4887","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43735/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43735/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43735/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/93d5764adc83f87bbddf52f2b6acfb7cb6629d4d","head":{"label":"vicennial:SPARK-45856","ref":"SPARK-45856","sha":"93d5764adc83f87bbddf52f2b6acfb7cb6629d4d","user":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":402021456,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MDIwMjE0NTY=","name":"spark","full_name":"vicennial/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vicennial","id":21010250,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDEwMjUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21010250?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial","html_url":"https://github.com/vicennial","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vicennial/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":f

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to enforce creation of `AnalysisException` sub-class exceptions with an error class always. In particular, it converts the constructor with a message to private one, so, callers have to create a sub-class of `AnalysisException` with an error class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis simplifies migration on error classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, since user code doesn't throw `AnalysisException` and its sub-classes in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake `ArrowBatchIterator` implement `AutoCloseable` and `ArrowConverters.createEmptyArrowBatch()` call close() to avoid memory leak.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`ArrowConverters.createEmptyArrowBatch` don't call `super.hasNext`, if `TaskContext.get` returns `None`, then memory allocated in `ArrowBatchIterator` is leaked.\r\n\r\nIn spark connect, `createEmptyArrowBatch` is called in [SparkConnectPlanner](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/planner/SparkConnectPlanner.scala#L2558) and [SparkConnectPlanExecution](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/execution/SparkConnectPlanExecution.scala#L224), which cause a long running driver consume all off-heap memory specified by `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize`.\r\n\r\nThis is the exception stack:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.arrow.memory.OutOfMemoryException: Failure

See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR addresses the current lack of support for case-insensitive schema handling in XML file formats. Our approach now follows the `SQLConf` case insensitivity setting in both schema inference and file read operations.\r\n\r\nWe handle duplicate keys in the following behavior:\r\n1. When we encounter duplicates (whether case-sensitive or not) in a row, we will convert them into an array and pick the first one we encounter as the array's name.\r\n2. When we encounter duplicates across rows, we will also respect the first one we encounter \r\n\r\nKeys of the map-type data are string types and are not treated as field names, thereby not requiring case-sensitivity checks.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  4. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo keep consistent with other file formats and reduce maintenance efforts.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-11-08T19:50:19Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T04:55:35Z","closed_at":"2023-11-14T04:55:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1d5c693c763ac3f0088ab91cff85f5e15461e909","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"sandip-db","id":131817656,"node_id":"U_kgDOB9tguA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/131817656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db","html_url":"https://github.com/sandip-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sandip-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43722/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43722/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43722/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dc536ab954cd201173558fda4d0a4fd6295df83f","head":{"label":"shujingyang-db:case-sensitive","ref":"case-sensitive","sha":"dc536ab954cd201173558fda4d0a4fd6295df83f","user":{"login":"shujingyang-db","id":135740748,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBc9TA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135740748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/shujingyang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":695990001,"node_id":"R_kgDOKXv28Q","name":"spark","full_name":"shujingyang-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shujingyang-db","id":135740748,"node_id":"U_kgDOCBc9TA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/135740748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db","html_url":"https://github.com/shujingyang-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shujingyang-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shujingyang-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModify the calculation formula of Pearson correlation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark uses the formula `ck / sqrt(xMk * yMk)` to calculate the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. If `xMk` and `yMk` are very small, it can lead to double multiplication overflow, resulting in a denominator of 0. This leads to an Infinity result in the calculation.\r\n\r\nFor example, when calculating the correlation for the same columns a and b in the following table, the result will be Infinity, but the correlation for identical columns should be 1.0 instead.\r\na | b\r\n-- | --\r\n1e-200 | 1e-200\r\n1e-200 | 1e-200\r\n1e-100 | 1e-100\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val tinyDouble = Seq(1e-200, 1e-200, 1e-100)\r\ntinyDouble: Seq[Double] = List(1.0E-200, 1.0E-200, 1.0E-100)\r\n\r\nscala> val df3 = tinyDouble.zip(tinyDouble).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\ndf3: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [a: double, b: double]\r\n\r\nscala> df3.stat.corr(\"a\", \"b\", \"pearson\")\r\nres0: Double = Infinity\r\n```\r\n\r\nModifying the formula to `ck / sqrt(xMk) / sqrt(yMk)` can indeed solve this issue and improve the stability of the calculation. The benefit of this modification is that it splits the square root of the denominator into two parts: `sqrt(xMk)` and `sqrt(yMk)`. This helps avoid multiplication overflow or cases where the product of extremely small values becomes zero.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe precision of the decimal last digit in some results may change. For example, the corr result for two columns that used to be equal to 1.0 may now become 0.9999999999999999.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a unit test case in DataFrameStatSuite.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-08T05:53:24Z","updated_at":"2023-11-20T06:20:41Z","closed_at":"2023-11-20T06:20:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8ef946a0d8441aa76f7d340d0465b2088fceee06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds Variant data type in Spark. It doesn't actually introduce any binary encoding, but just has the `value` and `metadata` binaries.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n- The in-memory Variant representation in different types of Spark rows. All rows except `UnsafeRow` use the `VariantVal` object to store an Variant value. In the `UnsafeRow`, the two binaries are stored contiguously. \r\n- Spark parquet writer and reader support for the Variant type. This is agnostic to the detailed binary encoding but just transparently reads the two binaries.\r\n- A dummy Spark `parse_json` implementation so that I can manually test the writer and reader. It currently returns an `VariantVal` with value being the raw bytes of the input string and empty metadata. This is **not** a valid Variant value in the final binary encoding.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n**Problem**\r\nIf you attempt to start multiple Spark instances within a second there is a high likelihood that this spark-class-launcher-output file will have the same name for multiple instances, causing the Spark launcher to fail. The error will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.\r\nWARNING - The system cannot find the file C:\\Users\\CURRENTUSER\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\spark-class-launcher-output-21229.txt.\r\nWARNING - The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWindows' %RANDOM% is seeded with 1-second granularity. We often start ~20 instances at the same time daily in Windows and encounter this bug on a weekly basis\r\n\r\n**Proposed Fix**\r\nInstead of relying on %RANDOM% which has poor granularity, use Powershell to generate a GUID and append that to the end of the temp file name. We have been using this in production for around 2-3 months and have never encountered this bug since.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMy team runs Spark on Windows and we boot up 20+ instances within a few seconds on a daily basis. We encountered this bug weekly and have taken steps to mitigate it without changing the Spark source code like adding a random sleep between 1-300 seconds before starting Spark. Even with a random sleep, 20+ instances have a likelihood of sleeping a similar amount of time and starting at the same time. Also, relying on a random sleep before starting Spark is clunky, unreliable, and not a deterministic way to avoid this issue.\r\n\r\nEventually our team went ahead and edited the code in this .cmd file with this fix. I figured I should make a pull request for this as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nYou can pretty reliably recreate this bug by submitting 30 Spark jobs in Windows using spark-submit. Eventually the Spark launcher will overlap with another Spark launcher and fail.\r\n\r\nYou can pull my fixed spark-class2.cmd and try this again and there should be no incidence of this bug.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the case class `DataFrameQueryContext`, and add stack traces as a field and override `callSite`, `fragment` using the new field `stackTrace`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBy exposing the stack trace, we give users opportunity to see all stack traces needed for debugging.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, `DataFrameQueryContext` hasn't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DatasetSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to enforce creation of `ParseException` with an error class always. In particular, it converts the constructor with a message to private one, so, callers have to create `ParseException` with an error class.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis simplifies migration on error classes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo since user code doesn't throw `ParseException` in regular cases.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites, for instance:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryParsingErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SparkConnectClientSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-07T12:21:10Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T08:39:04Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T08:39:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"38d3610555cbc81decfad99e78005f5f3a0d1a16","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43702/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43702/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43702/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f43f4e6d7b4f758125f2313e7d1b4d455712b337","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:ban-message-ParseException","ref":"ban-message-ParseException","sha":"f43f4e6d7b4f758125f2313e7d1b4d455712b337","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to add new SQL config `spark.sql.stackTracesInDataFrameContext` which defines how many non-Spark stack traces should be captured into DataFrame query context. By default, the config is set to 1.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL. When users troubleshoot an issue, they might need more stack traces in the DataFrame context. For example:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\", true)\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.stackTracesInDataFrameContext\", 3)\r\nscala> spark.range(1).select(lit(1) / lit(0)).collect()\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [DIVIDE_BY_ZERO] Division by zero. Use `try_divide` to tolerate divisor being 0 and return NULL instead. If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error. SQLSTATE: 22012\r\n== DataFrame ==\r\n\"div\" was called from\r\n<init>(<console>:1)\r\n<init>(<console>:16)\r\n.<clinit>(<console>:1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, it doesn't change the default behaviour.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryContextSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark cast works in two modes: ansi and non-ansi. When overflowing during casting, the common behavior under non-ansi mode is to return null. However, casting from Timestamp to Int/Short/Byte returns a wrapping value now. The behavior to silently overflow doesn't make sense. This patch changes it to the common behavior, i.e., returning null.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReturning a wrapping value, e.g., negative one, during casting Timestamp to Int/Short/Byte could implicitly cause misinterpret casted result without caution. We also should follow the common behavior of overflowing handling.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes. Overflowing during casting from Timestamp to Int/Short/Byte under non-ansi mode, returns null instead of wrapping value.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWill add test or update test if any existing ones fail\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, only the native V1 file-based streaming source can read the `_metadata` column: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/370870b7a0303e4a2c4b3dea1b479b4fcbc93f8d/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamingRelation.scala#L63\r\n\r\nOur goal is to create an interface that allows other streaming sources to add `_metadata` columns. For instance, we would like the Delta Streaming source, which you can find here: https://github.com/delta-io/delta/blob/master/spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/delta/sources/DeltaDataSource.scala#L49, to extend this interface and provide the `_metadata` column for its underlying storage format, such as Parquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nA generic interface to enable other streaming sources to expose and add `_metadata` columns.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-07T03:26:18Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T11:36:02Z","closed_at":"2023-11-09T11:36:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e05b049a66911e8d7b295bf20275cd89721241b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake `ArrowBatchIterator` implement `AutoCloseable` and `ArrowConverters.createEmptyArrowBatch()` call close() to avoid memory leak.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`ArrowConverters.createEmptyArrowBatch` don't call `super.hasNext`, if `TaskContext.get` returns `None`, then memory allocated in `ArrowBatchIterator` is leaked. \r\n\r\nIn spark connect, `createEmptyArrowBatch` is called in [SparkConnectPlanner](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/planner/SparkConnectPlanner.scala#L2558) and [SparkConnectPlanExecution](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/execution/SparkConnectPlanExecution.scala#L224), which cause a long running driver consume all off-heap memory specified by `-XX:MaxDirectMemorySize`.\r\n\r\nThis is the exception stack:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.arrow.memory.OutOfMemoryException: Failure

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a Python UDTF API to stop consuming rows from the input table.\r\n\r\nIf the UDTF raises a `SkipRestOfInputTableException` exception in the `eval` method, then the UDTF stops consuming rows from the input table for that input partition, and finally calls the `terminate` method (if any) to represent a successful UDTF call.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@udtf(returnType=\"total: int\")\r\nclass TestUDTF:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self._total = 0\r\n\r\n    def eval(self, _: Row):\r\n        self._total += 1\r\n        if self._total >= 3:\r\n            raise SkipRestOfInputTableException(\"Stop at self._total >= 3\")\r\n\r\n    def terminate(self):\r\n        yield self._total,\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis is useful when the UDTF logic knows that we don't have to scan the input table anymore, and skip the rest of the I/O for that case.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, see above.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds test coverage.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, users will see correct Decimal multiplication and division results.\r\nDirectly multiplying and dividing with `org.apache.spark.sql.types.Decimal()`

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr refactor `StorageUtils#bufferCleaner` as follows:\r\n- Change the return value of `bufferCleaner` from `DirectBuffer => Unit` to `ByteBuffer => Unit`\r\n- Directly calling `unsafe.invokeCleaner` instead of reflecting calls\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. After Scala 2.13.9, it is recommended to use the `-release` instead of the `-target` for compilation. However, due to `sun.nio.ch` module was not exported, this can lead to the issue of class invisibility during Java cross compilation, such as building or testing using Java 21 with `-release:17` After this pr, the following compilation errors will not occur again when build core module using Java 21 with `-release:17`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/serializer/SerializationDebugger.scala:71: object security is not a member of package sun\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/StorageUtils.scala:26: object nio is not a member of package sun\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/StorageUtils.scala:200: not found: type DirectBuffer\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/StorageUtils.scala:206: not found: type DirectBuffer\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/StorageUtils.scala:220: not found: type DirectBuffer\r\n[ERROR] [Error] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-13/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/StorageUtils.scala:26: Unused import\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Direct use of `unsafe.invokeCleaner` provides better performance, compared to reflection calls, it is at least 30% faster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Manual check building core module using Java 21 with `-release:17`, no longer compilation failure logs above\r\n\r\nNote: There is still an issue with other classes being invisible, which needs to be fixed in follow up\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the implementation of `sql.withOrigin`, and eliminate the magic number 3 from which the algorithm starts iterations. New implementation starts from the index 0, and finds the first block of Spark traces. It stops immediately after the block at the first non-Spark trace. For example: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"862\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-01 at 21 29 18\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/1580697/f80cf071-34b5-4d56-9f1c-c5bb28c87cab\">\r\n\r\nnew implementation finds the block [2, 4], and stops at the index 5 by catching and returning the block of traces [4, 6].\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe PR makes `withOrigin` more generic and improves code maintenance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing test suites, for instance:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DatasetSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-06T07:45:43Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T20:26:35Z","closed_at":"2023-11-06T20:20:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bce512f1f1bb1be39af89b123c835aa7d9d48e37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43671/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43671/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43671/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2430cd2f794fe7276e6c9d92c25ba363ad64aef2","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:refactor-withOrigin","ref":"refactor-withOrigin","sha":"2430cd2f794fe7276e6c9d92c25ba363ad64aef2","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is pr change to explicitly convert `Array` to `Seq` when function input is defined as `Seq `to avoid compilation warnings as like follwos:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/mllib-local/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/linalg/Vectors.scala:57:31: method copyArrayToImmutableIndexedSeq in class LowPriorityImplicits2 is deprecated (since 2.13.0): implicit conversions from Array to immutable.IndexedSeq are implemented by copying; use `toIndexedSeq` explicitly if you want to copy, or use the more efficient non-copying ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray\r\n[error] Applicable -Wconf / @nowarn filters for this fatal warning: msg=<part of the message>, cat=deprecation, site=org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vector.equals, origin=scala.LowPriorityImplicits2.copyArrayToImmutableIndexedSeq, version=2.13.0\r\n[error]             Vectors.equals(s1.indices, s1.values, s2.indices, s2.values)\r\n[error]                               ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are mainly three ways to fix it:\r\n- `tools` and `mllib-local` module: Since the `tools` and `mllib-local` module does not import the `common-utils` module, `scala.collection.immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` is used directly.\r\n- `examples` module: Since `ArrayImplicits` is an internal tool class in Spark, `scala.collection.immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` is used directly.\r\n- Other modules: By importing `ArrayImplicits` and calling `toImmutableArraySeq`, the `Array` is wrapped into `immutable.ArraySeq`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up deprecated Scala Api usage and using `Array.toImmutableArraySeq` equivalent to `immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` to avoid collection copy.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy use `ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` instead of `toIndexedSeq`:\r\n\r\n1. `ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` saves the overhead of collection copying compared to `toIndexedSeq`, it has less memory overhead and certain performance advantages. Moreover, `ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` is faster in scenarios such as \r\n  - `Array.fill.toImmutableArraySeq` versus `IndexedSeq.fill`\r\n  - `Array.apply(data).toImmutableArraySeq` versus `IndexedSeq.apply(data)`\r\n  - `Array.emptyXXArray.toImmutableArraySeq` versus `IndexedSeq.empty`.\r\n\r\n2. In Scala 2.12, when the function is defined as \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef func(input: Seq[T]): R = {\r\n\t...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nif an `Array` type data array is used as the function input, it will be implicitly converted by default through the `scala.Predef#genericArrayOps` function, the specific implementation is as follows:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  implicit def genericArrayOps[T](xs: Array[T]): ArrayOps[T] = (xs match {\r\n    case x: Array[AnyRef]  => refArrayOps[AnyRef](x)\r\n    case x: Array[Boolean] => booleanArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Byte]    => byteArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Char]    => charArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Double]  => doubleArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Float]   => floatArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Int]     => int(x    case x: Array[Long]    => longArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Short]   => shortArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Unit]    => unitArrayOps(x)\r\n    case null              => null\r\n  }).asInstanceOf[ArrayOps[T]]\r\n\r\n  implicit def booleanArrayOps(xs: Array[Boolean]): ArrayOps.ofBoolean   = new ArrayOps.ofBoolean(xs)\r\n  implicit def byteArrayOps(xs: Array[Byte]): ArrayOps.ofByte            = new ArrayOps.ofByte(xs)\r\n  implicit def charArrayOps(xs: Array[Char]): ArrayOps.ofChar            = new ArrayOps.ofChar(xs)\r\n  implicit def doubleArrayOps(xs: Array[Double]): ArrayOps.ofDouble      = new ArrayOps.ofDouble(xs)\r\n  implicit def floatArrayOps(xs: Array[Float]): ArrayOps.ofFloat         = new ArrayOps.ofFloat(xs)\r\n  implicit def intArrayOps(xs: Array[Int]): ArrayOps.ofInt               = new ArrayOps.ofInt(xs  implicit def longArrayOps(xs: Array[Long]): ArrayOps.ofLong            = new ArrayOps.ofLong(xs)\r\n  implicit def refArrayOps[T <: AnyRef](xs: Array[T]): ArrayOps.ofRef[T] = new ArrayOps.ofRef[T](xs)\r\n  implicit def shortArrayOps(xs: Array[Short]): ArrayOps.ofShort         = new ArrayOps.ofShort(xs)\r\n  implicit def unitArrayOps(xs: Array[Unit]): ArrayOps.ofUnit            = new ArrayOps.ofUnit(xs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implicit conversion will wrap the input data into a `mutable.WrappedArray`, for example for Array[Int] type data, it will be wrapped into `mutable.WrappedArray.ofInt`:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  final class ofInt(override val repr: Array[Int]) extends AnyVal with ArrayOps[Int] with ArrayLike[Int, Array[Int]] {\r\n\r\n    override protected[this] def thisCollection: WrappedArray[Int] = new WrappedArray.ofInt(repr)\r\n    override protected[this] def toCollection(repr: Array[Int]): WrappedArray[Int] = new WrappedArray.ofInt(repr)\r\n    override protected[this] def newBuilder = new ArrayBuilder.ofInt\r\n\r\n    def length: Int = repr.length\r\n    def apply(index: Int): Int = repr(index)\r\n    def update(index: Int, elem: Int) { repr(index) = elem }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  final class ofInt(val array: Array[Int]) extends WrappedArray[Int] with Serializable {\r\n    def elemTag = ClassTag.Int\r\n    def length: Int = array.length\r\n    def apply(index: Int): Int = array(index)\r\n    def update(index: Int, elem: Int) { array(index) = elem }\r\n    override def hashCode = MurmurHash3.wrappedArrayHash(array)\r\n    override def equals(that: Any) = that match {\r\n      case that: ofInt => Arrays.equals(array, that.array)\r\n      case _ => super.equals(that)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see, in Scala 2.12, Array type input will be implicitly converted into a `mutable.WrappedArray`, and no collection copying is performed.\r\n\r\nIn Scala 2.13, although the default implicit type conversion will perform a defensive collection copy, but based on the facts that existed when Spark using Scala 2.12, we can assume that it is still safe to explicitly wrap Array type input into an `immutable.ArraySeq` without collection copying in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch optimizes the handling of errors reported back to Python. First, it properly allows the extraction of the `ERROR_CLASS` and the `SQL_STATE` and gives simpler accces to the stack trace.\r\n\r\nIt therefore makes sure that the display of the stack trace is no longer only server-side decided but becomes a local usability property.\r\n\r\nIn addition the following methods on the `SparkConnectGrpcException` become actually useful:\r\n\r\n* `getSqlState()`\r\n* `getErrorClass()`\r\n* `getStackTrace()`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCompatibility\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUpdated the existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-11-05T23:54:06Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T20:52:50Z","closed_at":"2023-11-07T18:12:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c78b6459bbe3ba0285d39b3f9162ab9182224493","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3fafafc10ea12804c2e553351def7628ff639632","head":{"label":"grundprinzip:SPARK-XXXX-ex","ref":"SPARK-XXXX-ex","sha":"3fafafc10ea12804c2e553351def7628ff639632","user":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":503900825,"node_id":"R_kgDOHgjqmQ","name":"spark","full_name":"grundprinzip/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"grundprinzip","id":3421,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3421?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip","html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/grundprinzip/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/grundprinzip/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is pr change to explicitly convert `Array` to `Seq` when function input is defined as `Seq `to avoid compilation warnings as like follwos:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error] /Users/yangjie01/SourceCode/git/spark-mine-sbt/mllib-local/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/linalg/Vectors.scala:57:31: method copyArrayToImmutableIndexedSeq in class LowPriorityImplicits2 is deprecated (since 2.13.0): implicit conversions from Array to immutable.IndexedSeq are implemented by copying; use `toIndexedSeq` explicitly if you want to copy, or use the more efficient non-copying ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray\r\n[error] Applicable -Wconf / @nowarn filters for this fatal warning: msg=<part of the message>, cat=deprecation, site=org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vector.equals, origin=scala.LowPriorityImplicits2.copyArrayToImmutableIndexedSeq, version=2.13.0\r\n[error]             Vectors.equals(s1.indices, s1.values, s2.indices, s2.values)\r\n[error]                               ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are mainly four ways to fix it:\r\n- `tools` and `mllib-local` module: Since the `tools` and `mllib-local` module does not import the `common-utils` module, `scala.collection.immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` is used directly.\r\n- `examples` module: Since `ArrayImplicits` is an internal tool class in Spark, `scala.collection.immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` is used directly.\r\n- Introduce a helper function for `QueryTest` that accept the `Array` type `expectedAnswer`\r\n- Other modules: By importing `ArrayImplicits` and calling `toImmutableArraySeq`, the `Array` is wrapped into `immutable.ArraySeq`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up deprecated Scala Api usage.\r\n\r\nWhy use `ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` instead of `toIndexedSeq`:\r\n\r\n1. `ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` saves the overhead of collection copying compared to `toIndexedSeq`, it has less memory overhead and certain performance advantages. Moreover, `ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` is faster in scenarios such as \r\n  - `Array.fill.toImmutableArraySeq` versus `IndexedSeq.fill`\r\n  - `Array.apply(data).toImmutableArraySeq` versus `IndexedSeq.apply(data)`\r\n  - `Array.emptyXXArray.toImmutableArraySeq` versus `IndexedSeq.empty`.\r\n\r\n2. In Scala 2.12, when the function is defined as \r\n\r\n```\r\ndef func(input: Seq[T]): R = {\r\n\t...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nif an `Array` type data array is used as the function input, it will be implicitly converted by default through the `scala.Predef#genericArrayOps` function, the specific implementation is as follows:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  implicit def genericArrayOps[T](xs: Array[T]): ArrayOps[T] = (xs match {\r\n    case x: Array[AnyRef]  => refArrayOps[AnyRef](x)\r\n    case x: Array[Boolean] => booleanArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Byte]    => byteArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Char]    => charArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Double]  => doubleArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Float]   => floatArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Int]     => int(x    case x: Array[Long]    => longArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Short]   => shortArrayOps(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Unit]    => unitArrayOps(x)\r\n    case null              => null\r\n  }).asInstanceOf[ArrayOps[T]]\r\n\r\n  implicit def booleanArrayOps(xs: Array[Boolean]): ArrayOps.ofBoolean   = new ArrayOps.ofBoolean(xs)\r\n  implicit def byteArrayOps(xs: Array[Byte]): ArrayOps.ofByte            = new ArrayOps.ofByte(xs)\r\n  implicit def charArrayOps(xs: Array[Char]): ArrayOps.ofChar            = new ArrayOps.ofChar(xs)\r\n  implicit def doubleArrayOps(xs: Array[Double]): ArrayOps.ofDouble      = new ArrayOps.ofDouble(xs)\r\n  implicit def floatArrayOps(xs: Array[Float]): ArrayOps.ofFloat         = new ArrayOps.ofFloat(xs)\r\n  implicit def intArrayOps(xs: Array[Int]): ArrayOps.ofInt               = new ArrayOps.ofInt(xs  implicit def longArrayOps(xs: Array[Long]): ArrayOps.ofLong            = new ArrayOps.ofLong(xs)\r\n  implicit def refArrayOps[T <: AnyRef](xs: Array[T]): ArrayOps.ofRef[T] = new ArrayOps.ofRef[T](xs)\r\n  implicit def shortArrayOps(xs: Array[Short]): ArrayOps.ofShort         = new ArrayOps.ofShort(xs)\r\n  implicit def unitArrayOps(xs: Array[Unit]): ArrayOps.ofUnit            = new ArrayOps.ofUnit(xs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implicit conversion will wrap the input data into a `mutable.WrappedArray`, for example for Array[Int] type data, it will be wrapped into `mutable.WrappedArray.ofInt`:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  final class ofInt(override val repr: Array[Int]) extends AnyVal with ArrayOps[Int] with ArrayLike[Int, Array[Int]] {\r\n\r\n    override protected[this] def thisCollection: WrappedArray[Int] = new WrappedArray.ofInt(repr)\r\n    override protected[this] def toCollection(repr: Array[Int]): WrappedArray[Int] = new WrappedArray.ofInt(repr)\r\n    override protected[this] def newBuilder = new ArrayBuilder.ofInt\r\n\r\n    def length: Int = repr.length\r\n    def apply(index: Int): Int = repr(index)\r\n    def update(index: Int, elem: Int) { repr(index) = elem }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  final class ofInt(val array: Array[Int]) extends WrappedArray[Int] with Serializable {\r\n    def elemTag = ClassTag.Int\r\n    def length: Int = array.length\r\n    def apply(index: Int): Int = array(index)\r\n    def update(index: Int, elem: Int) { array(index) = elem }\r\n    override def hashCode = MurmurHash3.wrappedArrayHash(array)\r\n    override def equals(that: Any) = that match {\r\n      case that: ofInt => Arrays.equals(array, that.array)\r\n      case _ => super.equals(that)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see, in Scala 2.12, Array type input will be implicitly converted into a `mutable.WrappedArray`, and no collection copying is performed.\r\n\r\nIn Scala 2.13, although the default implicit type conversion will perform a defensive collection copy, but based on the facts that existed when Spark using Scala 2.12, we can assume that it is still safe to explicitly wrap Array type input into an `immutable.ArraySeq` without collection copying in Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWithout this patch, when the server would restart because of an abnormal condition, the client would not realize that this be the case. For example, when a driver OOM occurs and the driver is restarted, the client would not realize that the server is restarted and a new session is assigned.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes this behavior and asserts that the server side session ID does not change during the connection. If it does change it throws an exception like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> spark.range(10).collect()\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/martin.grund/Development/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/dataframe.py\", line 1710, in collect\r\n    table, schema = self._to_table()\r\n  File \"/Users/martin.grund/Development/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/dataframe.py\", line 1722, in _to_table\r\n    table, schema = self._session.client.to_table(query, self._plan.observations)\r\n  File \"/Users/martin.grund/Development/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 839, in to_table\r\n    table, schema, _, _, _ = self._execute_and_fetch(req, observations)\r\n  File \"/Users/martin.grund/Development/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1295, in _execute_and_fetch\r\n    for response in self._execute_and_fetch_as_iterator(req, observations):\r\n  File \"/Users/martin.grund/Development/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1273, in _execute_and_fetch_as_iterator\r\n    self._handle_error(error)\r\n  File \"/Users/martin.grund/Development/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1521, in _handle_error\r\n    raise error\r\n  File \"/Users/martin.grund/Development/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1266, in _execute_and_fetch_as_iterator\r\n    yield from handle_response(b)\r\n  File \"/Users/martin.grund/Development/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1193, in handle_response\r\n    self._verify_response_integrity(b)\r\n  File \"/Users/martin.grund/Development/spark/python/pyspark/sql/connect/client/core.py\", line 1622, in _verify_response_integrity\r\n    raise SparkConnectException(\r\npyspark.errors.exceptions.connect.SparkConnectException: Received incorrect server side session identifier for request.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to upgrade oracle jdbc driver from `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8:23.2.0.0` to `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc11:23.3.0.23.09`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt is often found that `Run Docker integration tests` is interrupted due to `OracleIntegrationSuite` failure.\r\nSeveral possible issues have been identified:\r\n- The `oracle jdbc driver` currently used in Spark is `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8`, it not for use with `JDK17`.\r\nhttps://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/maven-central-guide.html\r\n<img width=\"1311\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/984c64df-f299-4e09-916e-cf27fccda1b4\">\r\n\r\n- The `oracle server` version used in our GA environment is also `23.3`\r\n<img width=\"500\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/6dce2d31-6aeb-4f44-a017-138258eaff7c\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter upgrade to `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc11`, I attempted to trigger `Run Docker integration tests` 6 times (trigger date distribution: day, night or weekend, etc.), and have all been successful for the `first time`.\r\nhttps://github.com/panbingkun/spark/actions/runs/6760572538/job/18383757692\r\nhttps://github.com/panbingkun/spark/actions/runs/6765163954/job/18399468066\r\nhttps://github.com/panbingkun/spark/actions/runs/6778851101/job/18465823046\r\nhttps://github.com/panbingkun/spark/actions/runs/6797719942/job/18480445904\r\nhttps://github.com/panbingkun/spark/actions/runs/6804543746/job/18502353511\r\nhttps://github.com/panbingkun/spark/actions/runs/6809925232/job/18521970051\r\n\r\nSo, I proposed upgrading this driver first and then continuing to observe the effect.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-05T09:27:10Z","updated_at":"2023-11-10T02:48:51Z","closed_at":"2023-11-10T02:48:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dd13ce39969d87543d5d6fe52983eccbb4681208","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43662/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43662/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43662/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b1200a086c6dc2778aa203a7a6f52ff303678f7b","head":{"label":"panbingkun:oracle_integration_suite_fix","ref":"oracle_integration_suite_fix","sha":"b1200a086c6dc2778aa203a7a6f52ff303678f7b","user":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":481429011,"node_id":"R_kgDOHLIGEw","name":"spark","full_name":"panbingkun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panbingkun","id":15246973,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjQ2OTcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15246973?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun","html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panbingkun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panbingkun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to move `graphx` module test from `core` pipeline to `mllib` pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo off-load `core` test pipeline and avoid the situation where `graphx` patch triggers `core` pipeline.\r\n- `core` test pipeline takes 1 and half hour in general.\r\n- `mllib*` test pipeline seems to be stable in these day and finished in a hour.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs and manually check.\r\n\r\n-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support to rotate app number by introducing a new configuration, `spark.deploy.appNumberModulo`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nHistorically, Apache Spark's App ID has a style, `app-yyyyMMddHHmmss-1234`. Since the 3rd part, `1234`, is a simple sequentially incremented number without any rotation, the generated IDs are like the following.\r\n```\r\napp-yyyyMMddHHmmss-0000\r\napp-yyyyMMddHHmmss-0001\r\n...\r\napp-yyyyMMddHHmmss-9999\r\napp-yyyyMMddHHmmss-10000\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we support rotation by modulo 10000, it will keep 4 digits.\r\n```\r\napp-yyyyMMddHHmmss-0000\r\napp-yyyyMMddHHmmss-0001\r\n...\r\napp-yyyyMMddHHmmss-9999\r\napp-yyyyMMddHHmmss-0000\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that the second part changes every seconds. In general, modulo by 10000 is enough to generate unique AppIDs.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example to use modulo 1000.
