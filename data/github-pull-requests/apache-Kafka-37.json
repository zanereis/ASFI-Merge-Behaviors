there,\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this PR is that we're trying to migrate our codebase to Scala 3. Since Scala 3 is able to consume Scala 2.13 libraries, we can use the Scala 2.13 version of kafka-streams-scala, but that pulls in the scala-collections-compat_2.13 library as a dependency. Another one of our dependencies pulls in scala-collections-compat_3, and you can't have both on the classpath at the same time. Luckily this library is actually not required at all when compiling with Scala 2.13, so that dependency should just be removed.

requires client instance cache in broker which should also have a time-based eviction policy where client instances which are not actively sending metrics should be evicted. KIP mentions `This client instance specific state is maintained in broker memory up to MAX(60*1000, PushIntervalMs * 3) milliseconds`. \r\n\r\nThe PR adds support to evict such instances from the cache. There could be multiple approaches for the eviction i.e.\r\n1. Periodically iterating on all entries in the cache as every instance can have different TTL (based on configured push interval)\r\n2. Using heap to store instance eviction - using delay queues\r\n3. Using hashed wheel timer which updates and evicts entries in O(1) time (minor overhead of bucketed delay queues)\r\n\r\nThe PR uses option 3 (hashed wheel timer) to implement the cache eviction.\r\n\r\nI have also moved a wrapper class for SystemTimer from `group-coordinator` to `utils`.\r\n\r\ncc: @AndrewJSchofield @junrao    \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

is a follow-up to #15154 which propagates the generic type for ProcessingContext upward through all its call-sites.\r\n\r\nI decided to avoid generifying the WorkerTask and instead separate the common retryWithToleranceOperator field into two fields with different types. This is because the only operation which was present in the WorkerTask was the retryWithToleranceOperator.triggerStop() call, which doesn't use the ProcessingContext.\r\n\r\nThis also makes the type system enforce that the DeadLetterQueueReporter only works for sink tasks, and the LogReporter must be specialized as either LogReporter.Sink or LogReporter.Source.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

a broker is down, and a topic is deleted, this will result in that broker seeing \"stray replicas\" the next time it starts up. These replicas contain data that used to be important, but which now needs to be deleted. Stray replica deletion is handled during the initial metadata publishing step on the broker.\r\n\r\nPreviously, we deleted these stray replicas after starting up BOTH LogManager and ReplicaManager. However, this wasn't quite correct. The presence of the stray replicas confused ReplicaManager. Instead, we should delete the stray replicas BEFORE starting ReplicaManager.\r\n\r\nThis bug triggered when a topic was deleted and re-created while a broker was down, and some of the replicas of the re-created topic landed on that broker. The impact was that the stray replicas were deleted, but the new replicas for the next iteration of the topic never got created. This, in turn, led to persistent under-replication until the next time the broker was restarted.","created_at":"2024-01-18T18:56:39Z","updated_at":"2024-01-30T12:43:31Z","closed_at":"2024-01-30T06:36:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c459c5daae481900eacc346eae43afcd75f4f4e4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/bbab3e60d6eb5292c42715e0f6d036b6d0a8a515","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-14616","ref":"KAFKA-14616","sha":"bbab3e60d6eb5292c42715e0f6d036b6d0a8a515","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

holding sensor references for recording purposes.\r\n- Created OffsetCommitMetricsManager so that we are more consistent with the metrics management\r\n- Extended KafkaConsumerMetrics to the AbstractConsumerMetrics so that the groupName is consistently created (without random concatenation)\r\n\r\nSome follow ups:\r\n- Refactor commit sensor by introducing a CommitMetrics module so that

   KAFKA-16120: Fix partition reassignment during ZK migration\r\n\r\n    When we are migrating from ZK mode to KRaft mode, the brokers pass through a phase where they are\r\n    running in ZK mode, but the controller is in KRaft mode (aka a kcontroller). This is called \"hybrid\r\n    mode.\" In hybrid mode, the KRaft controllers send old-style controller RPCs to the remaining ZK\r\n    mode brokers. (StopReplicaRequest, LeaderAndIsrRequest, UpdateMetadataRequest, etc.)\r\n\r\n    To complete partition reassignment, the kcontroller must send a StopReplicaRequest to any brokers\r\n    that no longer host the partition in question. Previously, it was sending this StopReplicaRequest\r\n    with delete = false. This led to stray partitions, because the partition data was never removed as\r\n    it should have been. This PR fixes it to set delete = true. This fixes KAFKA-16120.\r\n\r\n    There is one additional problem with partition reassignment in hybrid mode, tracked as KAFKA-16121.\r\n    The issue is that in ZK mode, brokers ignore any LeaderAndIsr request where the partition leader\r\n    epoch is less than or equal to the current partition leader epoch. However, when in hybrid mode,\r\n    just as in KRaft mode, we do not bump the leader epoch when starting a new reassignment, see:\r\n    `triggerLeaderEpochBumpIfNeeded`. This PR resolves this problem by adding a special case on the\r\n    broker side when isKRaftController = true.\r\n\r\n    Reviewers: Akhilesh Chaganti <akhileshchg@users.noreply.github.com>, Colin P.

returns a boolean that indicates whether the operation completed within the specified timeout or not. This is similar to the variant of [CountdownLatch::await](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/CountDownLatch.html#await(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)) with the same signature.\r\n\r\nHowever, every single call site for this method either throws an exception when the return value is false with the intent to fail the test, or should do so but doesn't (i.e., the rest of the test operates under the assumption that after `StartAndStopLatch::await` has returned, the operation has completed successfully). Examples of the latter include [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/6ff21ee1e009a5a2729bb105591a9bfa16c6c4c5/connect/runtime/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/integration/RestExtensionIntegrationTest.java#L107) and

examples of the former include most other invocations of that method.\r\n\r\nIn order to simplify the API, the contract for the method is altered to have a `void` return type, and throw a `TimeoutException` if the timeout elapses before the operation completes, instead of return true/false depending on whether the operation completed successfully within the timeout.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some extra granularity is added to the error messages in these `TimeoutException` instances that may aid in debugging some flaky integration tests, such as the `ConnectorRestartApiIntegrationTest::testMultiWorkerRestartOnlyConnector` case reported in [KAFKA-15675](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15675).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded

Streams checkpoints the wrong offset when a task is closed during restoration. If under exactly-once processing guarantees a TaskCorruptedException happens, the affected task is closed dirty, its state content is wiped out and the task is re-initialized. If during the following restoration the task is closed cleanly, the task writes the offsets that it stores in its record collector to the checkpoint file. Those offsets are the offsets that the task wrote to the changelog topics. In other words, the task writes the end offsets of its changelog topics to the checkpoint file. Consequently, when the task is initialized again on the same Streams client, the checkpoint file is read and the task assumes it is fully restored although the records between the last offsets the task restored before closing clean and the end offset of the changelog topics are missing locally.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to clear the offsets in the record collector on close.\r\n\r\nCherry-pick of https://github.com/apache/kafka/commit/19727f8d51ac56a00f7159705349c981a063df8f\r\n\r\nReviewer: Lucas Brutschy <lbrutschy@confluent.io>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

patch removes the extra hop via the request thread when the new group coordinator verifies a transaction. Prior to it, the ReplicaManager would automatically re-schedule the callback to a request thread. However, the new group coordinator does not need this as it already schedules the write into its own thread. With this patch, the decision to re-schedule on a request thread or not is left to the caller.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation

is _not_ a `RocksObject`, which in theory means it's not backed by any native memory allocated by RocksDB.\r\n\r\nHowever, in practice, `ColumnFamilyHandle#getDescriptor()`, which returns a `ColumnFamilyDescriptor`, allocates an internal `rocksdb::db::ColumnFamilyDescriptor`, copying the name and options of the column family into it.\r\n\r\nSince the Java `ColumnFamilyDescriptor` is not a `RocksObject`, it's not possible to track this allocation and free it from Java.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in our case, we can simply avoid calling `ColumnFamilyHandle#getDescriptor()`, since we're only interested in the column family name, which is already available on\r\n`ColumnFamilyHandle#getName()`, which does not leak memory.\r\n\r\nWe can also optimize away the temporary `Options`, which was previously a source of memory leaks, because `userSpecifiedOptions` is an instance of `Options`.","created_at":"2024-01-11T11:21:44Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T21:24:05Z","closed_at":"2024-01-11T17:09:55Z","merged_at":"2024-01-11T17:09:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"890431751837c5f3b970a79e82ff40d002fc46a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15174/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/15174/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/15174/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/43a99e7b1782532cddc7cb714d375680e93c9bd2","head":{"label":"nicktelford:KAFKA-16089","ref":"KAFKA-16089","sha":"43a99e7b1782532cddc7cb714d375680e93c9bd2","user":{"login":"nicktelford","id":548378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford","html_url":"https://github.com/nicktelford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":439367730,"node_id":"R_kgDOGjA4Mg","name":"kafka","full_name":"nicktelford/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"nicktelford","id":548378,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODM3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/548378?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford","html_url":"https://github.com/nicktelford","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nicktelford/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/nicktelford/kafka","description":"Mirror

All partitions have tiered segments.\r\nAdding 3 more nodes to the cluster and making a reassignment to move all the data to new nodes.\r\nBehavior:\r\nFor most of the partitions reassignment is happening smoothly.\r\nFor some of the partitions when a new node starts to get assignments it reads __remote_log_metadata topic and tries to initialize the metadata cache on records with COPY_SEGMENT_STARTED. If it's reading such a message for the partition before the partition was assigned to this specific node it ignores the message, so skips the cache initialization and marks the partition as assigned. So reassignment is stuck since COPY_SEGMENT_STARTED is never properly processed.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\nThe partitions should not be marked as assigned before the cache is initialized to be able to re-read COPY_SEGMENT_STARTED message and initialize the cache.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\nThis is happening when there are messages in a single metadata partition and the order of the messages does not correspond to the order of assignment. So the follower reads the COPY_SEGMENT_STARTED message, sees that the user partition is not yet assigned to this node, skips the message, and marks the user partition as assigned. Before the metadata record has been read another assignment for another user partition with the same metadata partition but that was already assigned comes in. This leads to one more offset reset to the last read offset, so the metadata records for just assigned partitions are never read since they are in the beginning of the metadata partition. So that skipped COPY_SEGMENT_STARTED seems to be never re-read, so the metadata cache is not initialized.\r\n\r\nA proposed solution is to reset the last read offset for metadata partition when the actual offset for that partition is reset to beginning. This allows the reassignment to finish

suspend, and in\r\nhandleAssigned, upon reassignment of that task, then SUSPEND action is\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nThen, once the state updater executes the removal, no pending action\r\nis registered

single ProcessingContext in the RetryWithToleranceOperator is subject to a data race when interacted with across multiple threads. Specifically, when the main task thread is converting records, an asynchronous error (from producer or errant record reporter) can intervene, and cause a non-problematic record to be incorrectly dropped silently.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, make ProcessingContext a per-record object which is passed between threads (task-main-thread -> producer io thread/task-main-thread -> task internal thread) but never accessed concurrently. This has a number of benefits:\r\n\r\n1. No locking on the happy-path, where before every RWTO operation was synchronized (failures are still synchronized to collect the totalFailures & report errors)\r\n2. Less mutability in the ProcessingContext which is easier to reason about\r\n3. Easier to add parallelism to the transformation chain in the future\r\n\r\nThis comes at the cost of additional memory pressure from allocating more ProcessingContext objects, which should be negligible compared to the ConnectRecords themselves, and comparable to the existing InternalSinkRecord.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

KIP-848, we introduce the notion of Group Types based on the protocol type that the members in the consumer group use. As of now we support two types of groups:\r\n\r\nClassic : Members use the classic consumer group protocol ( existing one )\r\nConsumer : Members use the consumer group protocol introduced in KIP-848.\r\nCurrently List Groups allows users to list all the consumer groups available. KIP-518 introduced filtering the consumer groups by the state that they are in. We now want to allow users to filter consumer groups by type.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes all the changes to the API and the listGroups implementation in both the old group coordinator and the new group coordinator.","created_at":"2024-01-08T21:19:39Z","updated_at":"2024-02-05T08:56:39Z","closed_at":"2024-02-05T08:56:39Z","merged_at":"2024-02-05T08:56:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"68745ef21a9d8fe0f37a8c5fbc7761a598718d46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The
