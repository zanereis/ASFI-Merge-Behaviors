Description\r\nThis PR addresses a problem analogous to the one presented in Issue #8088. The core of the issue is repetitive mock object creation for `VolumeTO` within the test suite of `XenServer610WrapperTest.java`. In this refactoring process, I have streamlined the mock creation process for `VolumeTO` to enhance code maintainability and reduce redundancy.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Changes\r\nAiming to provide a solution similar to what has been described for Issue #8088, I've introduced a method named `MockVolumeTO(String path)`. This method is specifically crafted to create consistent mock objects for `VolumeTO` based on the supplied path.\r\n\r\n#### Benefits of the Proposed Refactoring:\r\n\r\n- **The utilization of the `MockVolumeTO(String path)` method greatly simplifies the test cases within `XenServer610WrapperTest.java`, ensuring they are more comprehensible and easier to manage.**\r\n- **Should there be a

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two new preset variables into the Quota activation rules: hypervisor type and volume format. This allows operators to customize tariffs based on these two properties.\r\n\r\nThe respective preset variable will be injected into tariffs with the following usage types:\r\n- RUNNING_VM: `value.hypervisorType`;\r\n- ALLOCATED_VM: `value.hypervisorType`;\r\n- VM_SNAPSHOT: `value.hypervisorType`;\r\n- SNAPSHOT: `value.hypervisorType`;\r\n- VOLUME: `value.volumeFormat`;\r\n- VOLUME_SECONDARY: `value.volumeFormat`.\r\n\r\nExample of an activation rule using `value.hypervisorType`:\r\n```js\r\nif (value.hypervisorType=='KVM') {\r\n  1\r\n} else {\r\n  2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample of an activation rule using `value.volumeFormat`:\r\n```js\r\nif (value.volumeFormat=='QCOW2') {\r\n  3\r\n} else {\r\n  4\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this PR also fixes the preset variable `resourceType` being injected into the JavaScript interpreter without quotes, which prevented the activation rules from executing.\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-10-05 16:43:08,886 ERROR

Description\r\nThis PR addresses a problem similar to the one mentioned in Issue #8087 by adopting the same solution approach used in PR #8098. Specifically, it refactors the mock object creation for `NetworkVO` across test suites of four classes: `InstanceIpModelTest.java`, `VirtualMachineModelTest.java`, `VirtualNetworkModelTest.java`, and the `testCreateVMInterface` method in another class. The central concern is the repetitive mock object creations for `NetworkVO`.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Changes\r\nFollowing the methodology from PR #8098, I've introduced a new and reusable `MockNetworkVO` class. This class is designated for creating `NetworkVO` mock objects with consistent behavior, aiming to eliminate redundancy.\r\n\r\n#### Benefits of the Proposed Refactoring:\r\n\r\n- **This refactoring leads to a cleaner codebase, streamlining the test cases and enhancing maintainability.**\r\n- **Should there arise a need to modify the `NetworkVO` mock creation process in the future, adjustments will only be necessary within the `MockNetworkVO` class.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses two false positives in the Usage sanity checker:\r\n\r\n(1)\r\n\r\nA sanity check verifies if there are usage records of a template/ISO created after the template/ISO was removed.\r\n\r\nIn an environment with two zones, if a template gets removed from a zone and added back to it, `cloud.template_zone_ref` will have two entries related to the template; one marked as `removed`. In this situation, the operator will receive a false positive stating that there are usage records for the template/ISO after it was removed, even though the template/ISO is available in that zone.\r\n\r\nThis check was changed to verify if the template/ISO is currently available in that zone.\r\n\r\n(2)\r\n\r\nA sanity check verifies if there are usage records with a raw usage greater than the aggregation range.\r\n\r\nIf a VM has more than one NIC using the same network offering, CloudStack will group the usage of both NICs into a single network offering usage record; for example, two NICs used for 1 hour will result in an entry with a raw usage of 2 hours. In this situation, the operator will receive a false positive stating that there are usage records with a raw usage greater than the aggregation range.\r\n\r\nThis check was changed to consider the average usage of the NICs, instead of the raw usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI changed the initial delay in `UsageManagerImpl.java#L315` to 0 in order to run the sanity checks immediately when Usage starts. Then, whenever I wanted to run the sanity checks, I would set the last checked id in `/usr/local/libexec/sanity-check-last-id` to 1 and restart Usage.\r\n\r\nTo simulate the scenario in (1), I created the zone `zone2`, copied a template that was being used in `zone1` to `zone2` and deleted the template from `zone1`. Then, I copied it from `zone2` to `zone1`.\r\n\r\nBefore applying the changes:\r\n- I ran the sanity checks and verified that CloudStack reported template/ISO usage records created after it was removed;\r\n\r\nAfter applying the changes\r\n- I ran the sanity checks and verified that no errors were found;\r\n- I deleted the template from `zone1`, ran the sanity checks again and verified that CloudStack reported template/ISO usage records created after it was removed.\r\n\r\nTo simulate the scenario in (2), I set `usage.stats.job.aggregation.range` to 60 (hourly), created a VM with two NICs and waited until there were network offering usage records corresponding to the NICs. I verified that `raw_usage` was indeed 2.\r\n\r\nBefore applying the changes:\r\n- I ran the sanity checks and verified that CloudStack reported usage records with `raw_usage` greater than 1.\r\n\r\nAfter applying the changes:\r\n- I ran the sanity checks and verified that CloudStack did not report usage records with `raw_usage` greater than 1;\r\n- I manually changed the `raw_usage` of a usage record from 2 to 3, ran the sanity checks again and verified that CloudStack reported network offering usage records with `raw_usage` greater than

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of #7719\r\n\r\nL2 network is supported in advanced zone with security groups since #7719 \r\nHowever, the vlan must be specified for now, as vlan range is not allowed to be specified in guest physical network\r\nThis PR allows create/update vlan range of physical networks, so that vlan of L2 networks can be automatically allocated by cloudstack.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes an issue that VM without security groups cannot be deployed on L2 networks.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For

PR is to fix a few tests whose results are non deterministic/flaky in the module plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp. \r\n\r\n### Setup:\r\n\r\nJava version: 11.0.20.1  \r\nMaven version: 3.8.8   \r\n\r\n### Test failure reproduction:  \r\nThe test `com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest#testExecuteLiveLockWhenControllerAllowsLoginAndFollowsWithUnauthorizedButDoesNotRediect` assumes the order of keys to be maintained by a `HashMap`. This issue was verified using the [NonDex plugin](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex). \r\n\r\n#### Steps:\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/cloudstack.git\r\ncd cloudstack\r\nmvn install -pl plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp -am -DskipTests\r\nmvn -pl plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest#testExecuteLiveLockWhenControllerAllowsLoginAndFollowsWithUnauthorizedButDoesNotRediect\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Root cause and fix:\r\n\r\nTest failure in NonDex mode:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 1, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 1.767 s <<< FAILURE! - in com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest\r\n[ERROR] testExecuteLiveLockWhenControllerAllowsLoginAndFollowsWithUnauthorizedButDoesNotRediect(com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest)  Time elapsed: 1.761 s  <<< ERROR!\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n```\r\n  \r\nThe NullPointerException occurs at the following location \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/fcbf540369d5d51145573dc948e21930531a3fad/plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp/src/main/java/com/cloud/network/nicira/NiciraRestClient.java#L87\r\n\r\nbecause the `mockResponse` created in the test, does not get returned for the `execute` method.\r\n\r\nTo verify that the issue was due to the HttpRequestMatcher used by mockito, the following line: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/fcbf540369d5d51145573dc948e21930531a3fad/plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp/src/test/java/com/cloud/network/nicira/NiciraRestClientTest.java#L190  \r\n\r\nwas modfied to read `when(httpClient.execute(eq(HTTP_HOST), any(HttpUriRequest.class), eq(httpClientContext)))`.   \r\n\r\nThis allows matching any request class object. The test passed with this change when run on the NonDex tool confirming that the issue was here.\r\n\r\nOn adding logs to the `HttpRequestMatcher` class, it was deduced that the test fails when the order of keys returned by the login parameters is not the same as that configured in the test class.\r\n\r\nFailing case(ordered shuffled):\r\n\r\n```\r\n2023-10-19 18:11:15,312 ERROR [root] (main:) Wanted payload:password=adminpassword&username=admin\r\n2023-10-19 18:11:15,312 ERROR [root] (main:) Actual payload:username=admin&password=adminpassword\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors:

\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/fcbf540369d5d51145573dc948e21930531a3fad/plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp/src/test/java/com/cloud/network/nicira/NiciraRestClientTest.java#L82-L93\r\n\r\nand the source code builds them here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/fcbf540369d5d51145573dc948e21930531a3fad/plugins/network-elements/nicira-nvp/src/main/java/com/cloud/network/nicira/NiciraRestClient.java#L122-L131 \r\n\r\n### Fix\r\nTo make the map ordered for ensuring deterministic results during serialization/deserialization, changes were done at the source code and test by converting the `HashMap` to a `LinkedHashMap`. \r\n\r\n### Verification of fix\r\n- The test passes when run with the NonDex tool. \r\n- The entire test suite of the module passes.\r\n \r\n### Additional fixes\r\nThe change also fixed following tests in the same class which were flaky due to the same reason:\r\n- com.cloud.network.nicira.NiciraRestClientTest#testExecuteTwoConsecutiveUnauthorizedExecutions\r\n-

Description\r\nThis PR addresses the issue mentioned in #8087 by refactoring the test suites in three classes: `TungstenElementTest.java`, `TungstenFabricUtilsTest.java`, and `TungstenServiceImplTest.java`. The issue involves redundant mock object creations for `TungstenAnswer` in these test suites.\r\n\r\n#### Proposed Changes\r\nI propose refactoring the test code to eliminate redundancy and improve maintainability. Specifically, I suggest creating a reusable `CreateMockTungstenAnswer` class for creating `TungstenAnswer` mock objects with consistent stub behavior. \r\n\r\n#### Benefits of the Proposed Refactoring:\r\n\r\n- **As a result, we can reduce 321 lines of code, which makes the test cases smaller, easier to understand, and better to maintain.**\r\n- **After refactoring, if the `TungstenAnswer` mock creation needs to be modified in the future, the developer only needs to modify one time in `CreateMockTungstenAnswer` instead of 151 places of duplicate mock creation in 3 testclasses.**\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In

Description\r\n\r\nDepending on the agents' configuration, restarting a management server (preferred MS for the agent) will make the agent connect to another management server (non preferred MS). When the preferred MS comes back up, agent will try to disconnect with non-preferred MS and connect with the preferred MS. A race condition can happen during this process in which disconnection from non-preferred MS completes after the connection with preferred MS. This leads to agent to go into an `Alert` state. During this time, agent is still sending Ping to the preferred MS.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this issue by:\r\n* Taking a lock in database which ensures that for a host, only connection or disconnection can happen across different MS.\r\n* While processing the `Ping` command if the Host is not in `Up` state, we request the agent to send a startup command again to the connection. If the startup is successful, the agent will come back in Up state.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\nTo reproduce the issue,\r\n1. apply the patch below.\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/engine/orchestration/src/main/java/com/cloud/agent/manager/AgentManagerImpl.java b/engine/orchestration/src/main/java/com/cloud/agent/manager/AgentManagerImpl.java\r\nindex b74c11cf..aec8a8dd 100644\r\n--- a/engine/orchestration/src/main/java/com/cloud/agent/manager/AgentManagerImpl.java\r\n+++ b/engine/orchestration/src/main/java/com/cloud/agent/manager/AgentManagerImpl.java\r\n@@ -836,6 +836,9 @@ public class AgentManagerImpl extends ManagerBase implements AgentManager, Handl\r\n \r\n         removeAgent(attache, nextStatus);\r\n         // update the DB\r\n+        try {\r\n+            Thread.sleep(5000L);\r\n+        } catch (Exception e){}\r\n         if (host != null && transitState) {\r\n             disconnectAgent(host, event, _nodeId);\r\n         }\r\n```\r\n2.

On management server, set a debugger here:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/9df580cef457cdb767aa5bea926500fa8b1263ca/server/src/main/java/com/cloud/capacity/CapacityManagerImpl.java#L383\r\n2. Deploy a VM. When the debugger reaches the line above, do the following:\r\n    1) Run `SELECT id, state, pod_id, host_id, last_host_id FROM vm_instance ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;` on the `cloud` database.\r\n    2) Get the pod_id from the above and run this query for that pod_id `UPDATE host_pod_ref SET allocation_state = 'Disabled' WHERE id = <pod id>`.\r\n    3) Set `hostHasCpuCapability = false` in the debugger to throw an error in the first run.\r\n    4) VM is retried again once more after this failure. Before the fix, it won't stop at the debugger since it no longer has any available resources to deploy on. After the fix, it will stop again at the debugger.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes four issues related to the disk offering override in the VM deployment wizard:\r\n\r\n1. When a user selects a compute offering associated to a disk offering, enables root disk offering override and selects an offer other than the default one, the UI freezes. This only happens when the UI is not running locally;\r\n2. When a user enables root disk offering override and selects an offer by clicking inside its radio button, the radio button becomes checked, but the selected root disk offering is not updated and the VM gets deployed with the default offering;\r\n3. When a user enables root disk offering override, selects an offer, disables the override and deploys a VM, the root disk offering still gets overridden and the VM is deployed with the selected offer;\r\n4. When a user deploys a VM using an ISO, if the compute offering has been selected before the ISO, and it does not have a compute only disk offering, the selected disk offering always gets overridden by the disk offering associated to the compute offering.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nFirst, I created two disk offerings:\r\n1. Name and description: D1. QoS type: Hypervisor. Disk read rate (IOPS) and disk write rate (IOPS): 500;\r\n2. Name and description: D2. QoS type: Hypervisor. Disk read rate (IOPS) and disk write rate (IOPS): 1000.\r\n\r\nAnd one compute offering:\r\n- Name and description: C1. CPU cores: 1. CPU (in MHz): 2000. Memory (in MB): 1024. Compute only disk offering disabled. Disk offerings: D1.\r\n\r\nTests related to the UI freezing when selecting a root disk offering:\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk did not use any disk offering and had the default size;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance, enabled the override, disabled the override and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk did not use any disk offering and had the default size;\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance, enabled the override, selected the disk offering D2, changed the disk size to 9 GB and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk was using D2 and had 9 GB;\r\n- I selected the compute offering C1 and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk was using D1 and had the default size;\r\n- I selected the compute offering C1, enabled the override, disabled the override and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk was using D1 and had the default size;\r\n- I selected the compute offering C1, enabled the override, selected the disk offering D2, changed the disk size to 9 GB and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk was using D2 and had 9 GB;\r\n- I selected the compute offering C1, enabled the override, selected the disk offering Medium and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk was using Medium and had 20 GB;\r\n\r\nTests related to the selected root disk offering not updating when clicking inside a radio button:\r\n- I selected the compute offering C1, enabled the override, selected the disk offering D2 by clicking inside its radio button, changed the disk size to 9 GB and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk was using D2 and had 9 GB.\r\n\r\nTests related to the root disk offering being overridden even though the override was disabled:\r\n- I selected the compute offering Small Instance, enabled the override, selected the disk offering D2, changed the disk size to 12 GB, disabled the override and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk was not using any disk offering and had the default size.\r\n- I selected the compute offering C1, enabled the override, selected the disk offering D2, disabled the override and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk was using D1 and had the default size;\r\n- I selected the compute offering C1, enabled the override, selected the disk offering Medium, disabled the override and deployed a VM. I verified that the root disk was using D1 and had the default size.\r\n\r\nTests related to the disk offering always being overridden when deploying using an ISO:\r\n- I selected the compute offering C1, an ISO and the disk size D1, changed the disk size to 12 GB and deployed a VM.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an config option for the Linstor primary storage driver, that allows you to automatically backup\r\nvolume snapshots to the secondary storage.\r\nAdditionally it will not mangle the need `java-linstor` dependency into the client.jar, but instead just copy\r\nthe `java-linstor.jar` into `lib`.\r\n\r\nConfig option is called: `lin.backup.snapshots` and is default `false`\r\n\r\nThe scope of this change should be limited, as it only touches the Linstor driver and a part of `copyAsync`\r\nwas implemented with 2 new Linstor specific commands.\r\n\r\n<!-- For new

After applying this fix on a 4.18.1 env, I could take a disk-only snapshots on VM with root/data disks and having qemu-guest-agent installed (and the global setting enabled):\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1108\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-10 at 2 13 07 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/95203/62c429a1-e291-49a2-8147-2399816a39d1\">\r\n\r\n2. On taking a disk-only snapshot of a running VM, I see snapshot (external) files created on the storage directory on the primary storage (tested local storage, but behaviour would be same on nfs as well). In my case there was a root disk and data disk, and therefore two files seen. This is also in the snapshot_store_ref table:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*************************** 36. row ***************************\r\n                id: 352\r\n          store_id: 17\r\n       snapshot_id: 185\r\n           created: 2023-10-10 08:51:09\r\n      last_updated: NULL\r\n            job_id: NULL\r\n        store_role: Primary\r\n              size: 26843545600\r\n     physical_size: 26843545600\r\nparent_snapshot_id: 0\r\n      install_path: /var/lib/libvirt/images/snapshots/2013cd98-17c8-4bd0-aeec-a6f97ebacb0b\r\n             state: Ready\r\n      update_count: 2\r\n           ref_cnt: 0\r\n           updated: 2023-10-10 08:51:10\r\n         volume_id: 758\r\n*************************** 37. row ***************************\r\n                id: 353\r\n          store_id: 17\r\n       snapshot_id: 186\r\n           created: 2023-10-10 08:51:10\r\n      last_updated: NULL\r\n            job_id: NULL\r\n        store_role: Primary\r\n              size: 53687091200\r\n     physical_size: 53687091200\r\nparent_snapshot_id: 0\r\n      install_path: /var/lib/libvirt/images/snapshots/8d287129-658f-4f90-82b5-4478b8bc7c65\r\n             state: Ready\r\n      update_count: 2\r\n           ref_cnt: 0\r\n           updated: 2023-10-10 08:51:10\r\n         volume_id: 759\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. However, creating (volume) snapshot from VM snapshot somehow failed for me.\r\n\r\n4. Reverting the snapshot also failed as this was a disk-only snapshot and VM was running. After stopping the VM, reverting the disk-only VM snapshot worked for me.","created_at":"2023-10-10T08:20:28Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T15:37:49Z","closed_at":"2023-10-11T15:26:46Z","merged_at":"2023-10-11T15:26:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"8350ce5aa40241d683749c1257813fa649e998be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"harikrishna-patnala","id":3348673,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNDg2NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3348673?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala","html_url":"https://github.com/harikrishna-patnala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/harikrishna-patnala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"GutoVeronezi","id":38945620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4OTQ1NjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38945620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi","html_url":"https://github.com/GutoVeronezi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/GutoVeronezi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"andrijapanicsb","id":45762285,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NzYyMjg1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45762285?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb","html_url":"https://github.com/andrijapanicsb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrijapanicsb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"weizhouapache","id":57355700,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MzU1NzAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57355700?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache","html_url":"https://github.com/weizhouapache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weizhouapache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":584072971,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODQwNzI5NzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:kvm","name":"component:kvm","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1663969521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjYzOTY5NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/Severity:Major","name":"Severity:Major","color":"903636","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4006883948,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAJTq2M7u1DJs","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/cloudstack/labels/component:storage","name":"component:storage","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com

This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a datastore cluster with 2 child datastores\r\n2. Add datastore cluster as primary storage in CloudStack\r\n3. Put the datastore cluster in maintenance mode or restart management server (as part of the fix, make sure the cloud.uuid in child storage pool does not. UUID has to be with hyphens)\r\n4. Add or remove new child datastore in vCenter\r\n5. Try sync storage pool operation on the datastore cluster => succeeded. \r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other

Description\r\n\r\nExtending the current functionality of KVM Host HA for the StorPool storage plugin and the option for easy integration for the rest of the storage plugins to support Host HA\r\n\r\nThis extension works like the current NFS storage implementation. It allows it to be used simultaneously with NFS and StorPool storage or only with StorPool primary storage.\r\n\r\nIf it is used with different primary storages like NFS and StorPool, and one of the health checks fails for storage, there is an option to report the failure to the management with the global config `kvm.ha.fence.on.storage.heartbeat.failure`. By default this option is disabled when enabled the Host HA service will continue with the checks on the host and eventually will fence the host\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR address issue #8034.\r\n\r\nWhile taking the volume snapshot on KVM, we call the method `copySnapshotToPrimaryStorageDir`. This method copies the base snapshot file to another directory, to enable the block commit for the delta of the disk right after taking the snapshot and avoid creating chains in the primary storage. However, copying a file (via the operating system) with a backing store will also copy the reference; therefore, it causes problems when the volume is not consolidated yet (which is always executed in KVM in volume migration process). If we create a template from the snapshot, and the deployment destination does not have access to the backing store file, the template will not be usable, as it would have a backing store pointing to the template that generated the volume.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to solve this situation by converting the base volume to the snapshot file instead of just copying it.\r\n\r\n### Types of

Description\r\n\r\nThis feature introduce a new type of template in CloudStack: \"VNF\"\r\n\r\nVirtualized Network Functions (a.k.a VNF) commonly refers to the software form of network appliances such as a router, firewall, load balancer, etc. \r\n\r\nVNF appliances are mostly deployed as virtual machines (VMs) on Linux KVM or VMware vSphere hypervisors on commercial off-the-shelf hardware (COTS).\r\n\r\nIt supports the life cycle of VNF templates:\r\n- register\r\n- update\r\n- list\r\n- delete\r\n\r\nIt also supports the management of VNF templates and deployment of VNF appliances

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses an issue found while scale testing CloudStack's `listVirtualMachines` API. It was observed that as the VM record count grows, the list APIs take progressively more time, even using paging to a smaller result set. With as little as 50k records the API starts to become noticeably slow, and by 100k records it becomes almost impossible to page through the VMs in the system in any reasonable amount of time. 100k records is not much in terms of MySQL, so I began trying to find the cause.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"581\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 12 45 55 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/1047709/d19e2bd7-cbf6-4f21-b78b-d316e1643f5b\">\r\n\r\nIt seems to mostly affect large result sets, but in some cases also affects queries with small result sets that require searches (like keyword search).\r\n\r\nThe UserVm view is joined to many other tables, and left joined so we get multiplication of rows.  In order to page, the full potential result set needs to be generated, and then the relevant page in the result set is selected. The current code fetches the relevant Vm IDs for the page from the view, then calls the view again to generate the API response for these VM IDs. \r\n\r\nI was unable to find any meaningful way to increase performance of the UserVM view, maybe I missed something.  However, I found that the UserVM table itself is much faster. As an alternative, I decided to modify the listVirtualMachines query to avoid the view and just join tables as necessary based on the input params.  This works because the search to fetch the page only needs the IDs, so no need to search the view.\r\n\r\nThe result is anywhere from a **2x to 8x improvement in list call times**.\r\n\r\nOne aspect of this PR is a change to how joins are processed. I added unit tests to ensure the existing behavior was unmodified, but I needed to add the ability to join the same table twice and generate an SQL table alias to do so. This was relevant for the performance of SSH key search, as with older VMs the only way to perform this search is via the value of user vm details, there is no direct map from VM to SSH key. To optimize this search a bit I added an additional join to narrow the scope by account, but to do so I needed to join the same table twice to other joined tables.\r\n\r\nOk, **this code is ugly**. I don't think it's much worse than the existing code was, but it's a big method with a lot of string binding per the way `SearchBuilder/SearchCriteria` work. If there's a much better way to refactor this, I'm all ears, but without cloudstack having some sort of benchmark suite it's a significant effort to test and re-test this. I'd be happy to have some help.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nThis is probably the most used API, so I'm very cautious about trying to make a change here where I'm not super familiar with the code. There are a number of tests that cover listing virtual machines, but I needed an explicit comparison to old vs new.\r\n\r\nIn testing I focused on regressions, assuming the existing state is correct. If there is a bug in what listVirtualMachines returns, it is replicated.\r\n\r\nI created a scale environment with two management servers, and a separate database server. One mgmt server was patched with this PR, and the other is unpatched. I then ran through varieties of listVirtualMachines calls and compared the result output to see if they were a perfect match between the patched and unpatched, as well as collected timing.\r\n\r\nI tested some combo queries (two or more parameters) to see if multiple joins were behaving properly.\r\n<img width=\"891\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 12 44 39 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/1047709/3583fd2d-f0a1-470a-bfe3-6d12a5c32534\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"886\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 12 44 29 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/1047709/14d14526-680c-4fad-93de-60154460b9d5\">\r\n\r\nI also tested with basic user API keys, mostly focusing on exercising that they don't see anything they shouldn't, or nothing has changed. The result sets are smaller, but there is still a noticeable performance boost.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"884\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 12 44 57 PM\"

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue of continuous poll of ReadyForShutdown API even after logout. \r\nThis poll is causing issues after logout with unnecessary login error messages and API

Login into CloudStack\r\n2. Observe the Networks tab in browser development console, observe \"readyForShutdown\" API calls\r\n3. Logout from CloudStack\r\n\r\nObserve that calling \"readyForShutdown\" API still continues. This PR clears that polling job.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR allows an admin to reserve some hypervisor host CPUs for system use. Another way to think of it is limiting the number of CPUs allocatable to VMs.  This can be useful if the admin wants to do other things with the hypervisor's CPU, for example reserve some cores for running hyperconverged storage processes.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking
