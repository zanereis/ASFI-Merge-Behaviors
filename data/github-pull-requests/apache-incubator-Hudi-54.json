*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis change is essentially a fallback from #5364, which introduced a regression passing incorrect partition-schema in cases where Hudi's custom `BaseFileOnlyRelation` is converted to `HadoopFsRelation` effectively treating COW tables in that case as non-partitioned ones.\r\n\r\n In this PR we fallback by default to previously existing behavior where we'd append partition values as parsed from the partition path.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Flip fallback configuration to true by default\r\n - Fix conditional incorrectly skipping parsing partition values\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\nThis pull request will also be

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nNowadays, more and more users use hudi as a pipeline storage(something like Apache Kafka), for streaming read or for incremental read. One important property for queue consumption is the data TTL, in case of consumption latency, the storage needs some mechanism to avoid exception while the readers read latency out of the TTL.\r\n\r\nSay Kafka has a strategy for their consumers, if people configure their TTL as 7 days, and one consumer consumes records before that time because it can not catch up with the producer. Kafka can give some strategies here:\r\n\r\n1. read directly from the latest offset\r\n2. throws error\r\n\r\nWhile hudi has two problems for this scenario here:\r\n\r\n1. we can not configure the TTL as 7 days like Kafka for two reasons:\r\n    1.1 the archiving/cleaning strategy force the clean retain commits number must be greater than the archiving min commits,\r\n     this restriction means a 7 days TTL(if we configure num commits cleaning strategy), would result in too many metadata \r\n     files on the active timeline, which is a pressure for the storage and for scanning performance\r\n    1.2 the data files are multi versioned, 7 days means there are too many redundant data files for the data set, which would  \r\n    cost too much money\r\n2. while the consumer is consuming a file but the cleaner removes it, a FileNotFoundException throws but no good way to \r\n    recover the job.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nCurrently we only accept hoodie.sql.bulk.insert.enable to control whether bulk_insert is enabled or not in spark sql mode, so during building buildHoodieInsertConfig(https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/f30b3aef3e5e12e9119d6b5294c94a0282719e00/hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hudi/ProvidesHoodieConfig.scala#L97), we use this param to decide insert operation. But it could be overridden at last: https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/f30b3aef3e5e12e9119d6b5294c94a0282719e00/hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hudi/ProvidesHoodieConfig.scala#L177\r\n\r\nSo if we set hoodie.datasource.write.operation=bulk_insert, **enableBulkInset is still false**, and this will set ENABLE_ROW_WRITER to false too.\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/f30b3aef3e5e12e9119d6b5294c94a0282719e00/hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hudi/ProvidesHoodieConfig.scala#L131\r\nbut method withSparkConf could override this, which change OPERATION.key back to bulk_insert\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/f30b3aef3e5e12e9119d6b5294c94a0282719e00/hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark-common/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hudi/HoodieSqlCommonUtils.scala#L251\r\n\r\nSo as a result, the operation is still bulk insert, but doesn't use spark row writer.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nHere we accept both hoodie.sql.bulk.insert.enable and hoodie.datasource.write.operation=bulk_insert to control whether we should allow bulk insert or not in sql mode .\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nNow flink offline compaction tool only handle one compaction plan in one execution.\r\n\r\nBut some time, compaction plan that created is faster than offline compact.\r\n\r\nSo it is neccessary to handle multi compaction plan in one offline compact.\r\n\r\nLuckly, flink provide a easy way to make the process parallelable. \r\n\r\nI make a new parameter named 'compactionPlanSelectStrategy' to define the offline compact tool how to select compaction plan to compact.\r\n\r\nFor example, 'SingleCompactionPlanSelectStrategy' will select first or last compaction plan from timeline and 'AllPendingCompactionPlanSelectStrategy' will select all pending compaction plan.\r\n\r\nIt is compatible for the parameter 'compactionSeq'. In default, compaction plan select strategy is 'SingleCompactionPlanSelectStrategy' means select first or last compaction plan according to 'compactionSeq'\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChange the compaction plan select strategy in flink offline compaction tool. It can choose multi compaction plan instead of choose first or last.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as `ITTestHoodieFlinkCompactor`.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [x] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [x] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIf a hudi table directory is lost on DFS due to some maloperation and cannot restore, user cannot drop it from SQL interface any more. We may provide an easy way for user to drop the table and do cleanup work. \r\nWhen resolving DropTableCommand, Spark analyzer retrieves schema of underlying table relation. Currently HoodieCatalogTable queries HoodieTableMetaClient for table schema, which cannot be constructed if table directory is broker/lost.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adjust HoodieCatalogTable -- returns table schema without dependency on underlying filesystem.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- When empty batch has been pulled in from source in deltastreamer and if commit has to be done so as to move the checkpoint, we need to pull the schema from table to get the latest table schema. But if table itself is empty, we were running into issues. This patch fixes that. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fixed DeltaStreamer to set the right schema with HoodieWriteConfig when empty batch is being committed. Fix is to fetch table schema and set it. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- TestHoodieDeltaStreamer.testParquetDFSSourceForEmptyBatch \r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a

Please double check if this table was indeed built via delta streamer. Last Commit :\r\n\r\n\"deltastreamer.checkpoint.reset_key\" : \"earliest\"\r\n```\r\nThe reason is that the value of `deltastreamer.checkpoint.reset_key` is `earliest`,but

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nAdded support for initializing DeltaStreamer without a defined Spark Master. That will enable the usage of DeltaStreamer on environments such as AWS Glue or other serverless environments where the spark master is inherited and we do not have access to it.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Modify HoodieDeltaStreamer class in order to have an option to inherit Spark Master.\r\n - Modify UtilHelpers class to have an option to start the Spark Context without defined Master.\r\n - Modify HoodieMultiTableDeltaStreamer to have the same default Spark Master( although right now is not used).\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [x] Necessary doc changes done or have another open
