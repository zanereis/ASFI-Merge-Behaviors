I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2107\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDelete adhoc `flowSpecs` from `flowCatalog` to avoid build up of adhoc flowSpecs in catalog even when job compilation fails by adding the deletion in a finally block in non-MA scheduler case. \r\n\r\n1. Previous PR: https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3944/files causes a bug where adhoc flows are not deleted when multi-active scheduler is enabled. This PR re-adds deletion of `flowSpec` to the `dagManager` to be called by the active host for the MA scheduler case (there will only be one active host if `dagManager` is enabled otherwise code will use `dagProcessingEngine`). \r\n2. It also ensures quota is released and failed flow compilation event sent by the `FlowCompilationValidationHelper` in all compilation failure cases. This was being incorrectly handled before. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- added a unit test `testDeleteFlowSpecCalledForMultiActivePath` that validates that the `compileAndSubmitFlowToDagManager` used by the `DagActionStoreChangeMonitor` attempts deleting adhoc flowSpecs from the catalog. Note that this test does not definitively ensure that this method is called by the `DagActionStoreChangeMonitor` which proves more complex but verifies if that method is used then the flow will be deleted after compilation. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

for the same dag action\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\ni) exception \"The job (DeadlineReminder.SN_CRMSYNC.DY-USE-924848907-443.1719443413180.DY-USE-924848907-443.ENFORCE_JOB_START_DEADLINE) referenced by the trigger does not exist.\" This is because of a race condition where unscheduleJob() deletes the job that scheduleJob() is trying to set. A retry should fix this.\r\nii) Sometimes a insert cdc event for job_start_deadline_enforcement dag action comes almost at the same time as the delete cdc event for the same dag action. delete may happen before insert, and this may leave the system with an exception in the logs and an extra unnecessary trigger. This PR adds a cache that will store the delete cdc event if it does not find any trigger to delete and when a insert cdc event will arrive it will be skipped\r\niii) call `sendEnforceJobStartDeadlineDagAction` after starting the job, not before that\r\niv) merge `addDagAction` and `addReminderDagAction` into one method\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2105) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nAs part of Gobblin compaction (deduplication), compacted files are moved from staging to their final location at the end of the process. This movement is handled by the org.apache.gobblin.compaction.action.CompactionCompleteFileOperationAction#onCompactionJobComplete method, which determines the appropriate destination path and moves the compacted files accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### Current Issue:\r\n- If the flag compaction.rename.source.dir.enabled is set to false (not in append mode) and recompaction.write.to.new.folder is set to true, a new directory is determined based on the execution count derived from the state file.\r\n- The state file, however, is generated after the move to the final location. If there are any failures during this move, the state file will be incorrect.\r\n- In the next execution, the determined destination path might already exist. This will cause the rename operation to create an additional child directory, as is the behavior of HDFS rename when the destination directory already exists.\r\n\r\n#### Requirement:\r\n\r\nWe need to ensure that the destination path determined must not exist before the rename operation.\r\n\r\n#### Changes\r\nWe have relocated the fs.delete logic outside the else block, ensuring it executes whenever we write the compaction data to a new directory. This change operates under the assumption that if the state file is incorrect, the previous compaction was incomplete, making it safe to proceed with deletion.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests org.apache.gobblin.compaction.action.CompactionCompleteFileOperationActionTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR addresses two bugs -\r\ni) exception \"The job (DeadlineReminder.SN_CRMSYNC.DY-USE-924848907-443.1719443413180.DY-USE-924848907-443.ENFORCE_JOB_START_DEADLINE) referenced by the trigger does not exist.\" This is because of a race condition where `unscheduleJob()` deletes the job that `scheduleJob()` is trying to set. A retry should fix this.\r\nii) Sometimes a insert cdc event for job_start_deadline_enforcement dag action comes almost at the same time as the delete cdc event for the same dag action. delete may happen before insert, and this may leave the system with an exception in the logs and an extra unnecessary trigger. This PR adds a cache that will store the delete cdc event if it does not find any trigger to delete and when a insert cdc event will arrive it will be skipped\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2102\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThere's a bug that causes GaaS multileader to kick off unintended concurrent flows which happens in the order described below:\r\n\r\nHost A checks the latest flow execution status to ensure the prior flow is not running, sees that the prior execution is still running.\r\nHost A fails the flow pending execution as it cannot run concurrent flow, this emits a FAILED event to GaaS which is ingested by the JobStatusMonitor.\r\nHost B checks the latest flow execution status, sees the current flow execution ID which is FAILED (considered a finished flow).\r\nHost B kicks off the pending flow execution when it shouldn't be\r\n\r\nWe are changing the so that it checks all the flow status and sees if they are in terminal state or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-26T04:16:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-28T18:40:20Z","closed_at":"2024-06-28T18:40:20Z","merged_at":"2024-06-28T18:40:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"4721d086f78553cab28e46bf406787df6cc2dea8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ffd22c022bf64e9660f265ef8fdefe5644716c55","head":{"label":"pratapaditya04:concurrent_flow_status_check_fix","ref":"concurrent_flow_status_check_fix","sha":"ffd22c022bf64e9660f265ef8fdefe5644716c55","user":{"login":"pratapaditya04","id":172026769,"node_id":"U_kgDOCkDrkQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172026769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04","html_url":"https://github.com/pratapaditya04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":811781687,"node_id":"R_kgDOMGLONw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"pratapaditya04/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pratapaditya04","id":172026769,"node_id":"U_kgDOCkDrkQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172026769?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04","html_url":"https://github.com/pratapaditya04","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pratapaditya04/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pratapaditya04/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2101\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nOwners and groups are not properly propagated in Manifest distcp where the owner and group of a nested child directory will only be applied to the child dir, and any directory created by fs.mkdirs() will have the proxy user (running user) owner/group. We want to keep this as consistent as possible as distcp.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses `ensureDirectoryExists` from the writer and moves it to HadoopUtils, in order to create a helper function that creates the entire directory tree with owners. groups. facls, and permission before the files are recursively renamed. After the recursive rename is completed, we need to reset the permissions again as the folder creation will add an execute bit to the user permissions (which may lead to a mismatch) in order to allow for renames to that folder while publishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-26T00:19:08Z","updated_at":"2024-06-27T19:46:59Z","closed_at":"2024-06-27T19:46:57Z","merged_at":"2024-06-27T19:46:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"af4b822a1e2f79721cdff617f1581e77ff261580","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3988/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3988/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3988/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f5e98cb53ccbfe8430d10fd4bfd005784c9eebc3","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:refactor-create-dir-with-permissions-manifest-distcp","ref":"refactor-create-dir-with-permissions-manifest-distcp","sha":"f5e98cb53ccbfe8430d10fd4bfd005784c9eebc3","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2099\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\ni) Set the group of quartz trigger for retry triggers and deadline triggers. This helps in debugging and help in understanding which kind of trigger was it.\r\nii) Fixed the equals and hashcode method for JobExecutionPlan. Because of the this, dagToJobs map was holding duplicate dag nodes when we call `addDagNodeState` on DMSS. because of duplicates, even after calling `deleteDagNodeState`, one DagNode will still remain there and  ReevaluateDagProc would think that the dag is still running and will not clean up the dag and FlowFinishDeadline dag action.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nupdated tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-24T19:46:16Z","updated_at":"2024-06-25T23:22:02Z","closed_at":"2024-06-25T23:22:02Z","merged_at":"2024-06-25T23:22:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"26cf6bc88b10e587fc215402d3fcffb9c7d442f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3985/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3985/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3985/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/dff4cea9fcf39b9c30994e78ac97c04117d95812","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:quartz","ref":"quartz","sha":"dff4cea9fcf39b9c30994e78ac97c04117d95812","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2097\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe notice that after deploying the service all subsequent scheduler triggers after the very first one are incorrectly marked as reminders even when they are for \"original\" events. This is a result of re-using the same `JobDetail`, `JobDataMap` and `Properties` object between the `original` and `reminder` Jobs for the `Scheduler` (all shallow copies). The following changes create deep copies of the aforementioned objects to use for the reminders so adding a reminder flag in one will not affect the other. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- adds new test to validate deep copy\r\n- updates previous test to validate they referred to the same obj\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-21T01:19:25Z","updated_at":"2024-06-25T21:24:26Z","closed_at":"2024-06-25T21:24:26Z","merged_at":"2024-06-25T21:24:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"e3108ddf8ea11c015fb099d8da586f4ebfdc7557","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3984/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3984/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3984/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/7e0933296bf1c8620c58e5d1e500fe51a36b7699","head":{"label":"umustafi:createUniquePropertiesMapForScheduler","ref":"createUniquePropertiesMapForScheduler","sha":"7e0933296bf1c8620c58e5d1e500fe51a36b7699","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2096\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe're seeing a `MySQLTransactionRollbackException`: Deadlock found when trying to get lock when calling `MysqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter. attemptLeaseIfNewRow() `in the rare case when two hosts check the lease arbiter table at the same time, see there's no entry matching the current primary key and try to insert it at the exact same time (both wait for lock on the same row). Normally, there's slight discrepancy that results in an `IntegrityConstraintViolationException` if one insert succeeds before the other OR  one finishes the write early and the other sees the entry when reading the `getResult` of the arbiter table. This PR adds retries with exponential backoff for transient SQL exceptions to the insert statement. Note, it's not needed for other cases when the INSERT/UPDATE statements are conditional on a read value. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nExponential backoff is tested by other functions, no other major updates here \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-18T22:49:00Z","updated_at":"2024-06-20T15:59:57Z","closed_at":"2024-06-20T15:59:57Z","merged_at":"2024-06-20T15:59:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9f83e638b6eb34fa85b0317eee31cf39c1e8546","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3982/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3982/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3982/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8869589b7d7288343671f656a6a10ab99f908586","head":{"label":"umustafi:malaDeadlockException","ref":"malaDeadlockException","sha":"8869589b7d7288343671f656a6a10ab99f908586","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2088 \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n   - Added retry with maximum number of attempts as 3 for OH replication final catalog commit\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n   - Added testRegisterIcebergTableWithRetryer() and testRegisterIcebergTableWithRetryerThrowsRuntimeException() \r\n   - In testRegisterIcebergTableWithRetryer(), I have mocked IcebergTable:registerIcebergTable() to throw runtime exception for intital two calls and then do nothing for third call so that retryer will finish after third call.\r\n   - In testRegisterIcebergTableWithRetryerThrowsRuntimeException(), IcebergTable:registerIcebergTable() will always throw RuntimeException, so after retrying for defailt retry_times(set to 5), retryer will finish with RetryException and will throw RuntimeException\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-17T19:32:02Z","updated_at":"2024-12-09T17:32:50Z","closed_at":"2024-07-10T21:07:38Z","merged_at":"2024-07-10T21:07:38Z","merge_commit_sha":"b44a91ea69dded11fc2229237026a575ec94603a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3976/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3976/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3976/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/32aed6290a18e71e6200429410abc7903a2ac953","head":{"label":"Blazer-007:virai_gobblin-2088","ref":"virai_gobblin-2088","sha":"32aed6290a18e71e6200429410abc7903a2ac953","user":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":808042965,"node_id":"R_kgDOMCnB1Q","name":"gobblin","full_name":"Blazer-007/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Blazer-007","id":43493515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNDkzNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43493515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007","html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Blazer-007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Blazer-007/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2089) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2089\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe current implementation doesn't check for FlowExecution existence before accepting a KILL or RESUME.\r\nUpdated the functions to call GET api first to get the FlowExecution. This GET api throws a 404 if a FlowExecution doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - Tested kill and resumse commands in dev fabric by adding the changed line to `GobblinServiceFlowExecutionResourceHandler` class resume and kill functions. Tested with flow executions which were present and did not exist in the `shared_gaas_job_status` table.\r\n    - Resume test screenshot:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/16535454/9e11d680-8b45-42ec-baa1-f93c0578810b)\r\n\r\n    - Kill test screenshot:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/16535454/84966454-880e-4ece-8297-610f6d4b0d2a)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-17T12:47:18Z","updated_at":"2024-06-18T18:06:30Z","closed_at":"2024-06-18T18:06:30Z","merged_at":"2024-06-18T18:06:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"046807e3212b651746fcff5d405d6b6cb8d151e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3975/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3975/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3975/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f734f35008be42563e0b9ed26fc7682228c7fb90","head":{"label":"abhishekmjain:fix-response-code-dag-actions","ref":"fix-response-code-dag-actions","sha":"f734f35008be42563e0b9ed26fc7682228c7fb90","user":{"login":"abhishekmjain","id":16535454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16535454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":810140032,"node_id":"R_kgDOMEnBgA","name":"gobblin","full_name":"abhishekmjain/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"abhishekmjain","id":16535454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NTM1NDU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16535454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain","html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/abhishekmjain/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/abhishekmjain/gobblin","description":"A

current implementation of the `DatasetHiveSchemaContainsNonOptionalUnion` class requires the database name to be extracted from the dataset URN using a regex pattern. This approach limits flexibility and can lead to errors if the URN format changes. To enhance the flexibility and usability of this class, we need to add support for an optional database name.\r\n\r\n**Current Issue:**\r\n- The database name must be extracted from the dataset URN using a regex pattern.\r\n- This dependency on the URN format limits flexibility and can lead to errors if the format changes.\r\n- Users cannot specify a database name directly, which could be more intuitive and flexible.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n- Introduce a new property `OPTIONAL_DB_NAME` in the `DatasetHiveSchemaContainsNonOptionalUnion` class.\r\n- Update the constructor and methods to check for the optional database name and use it if provided.\r\n- Add logging to indicate when the optional database name is used and when it replaces the pattern-extracted database name.\r\n- Ensure backward compatibility by retaining the existing behavior when the optional database name is not provided.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n- The `DatasetHiveSchemaContainsNonOptionalUnion` class should support an optional database name.\r\n- If the optional database name is provided, it should replace the database name extracted from the URN pattern.\r\n- The class should maintain its current functionality when the optional database name is not provided.\r\n- Appropriate logging should be added to indicate the use of the optional database name.\r\n- Tests should be added to verify the new functionality, including cases where the optional database name is and is not provided.\r\n\r\nThese enhancements will improve the flexibility and usability of the `DatasetHiveSchemaContainsNonOptionalUnion` class, allowing for more dynamic database configurations and reducing dependency on the dataset URN format.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2086\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAn ObjectAlreadyExistsException is thrown by the QuartzScheduler for deadline dagAction types when attempting to set a reminder on the lease of a deadline dagAction type because the original (non-reminder) job may still exist in the DagActionReminderScheduler. It's a non-fatal exception to have redundant reminders on the same dagAction so the code change gracefully handles this problem.\r\n \r\nException: \r\nUnable to store Job : '[flowgroup].[flowname].[flowid].ENFORCE_JOB_START_DEADLINE', because one already exists with this identification.\",\"stackTrace\":[{\"index\":0,\"call\":\"storeJob\",\"columnNumber\":null,\"fileName\":\"RAMJobStore.java\",\"lineNumber\":279,\"nativeMethod\":\"0\",\"source\":\"org.quartz.simpl.RAMJobStore\"},{\"index\":1,\"call\":\"storeJobAndTrigger\",\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- Updates test to verify jobs are not durably stored (orphaned jobs, or those without triggers, are deleted)\r\n- Adds test to validate no error thrown for job with multiple reminders\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-12T19:37:38Z","updated_at":"2024-07-19T20:28:15Z","closed_at":"2024-07-19T20:28:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4d2ead1ea07f763d837f5f80f4288f956bccbc1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3971/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3971/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3971/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/781ea51035e4ccd6ea00e0090b7b7c7d48190a72","head":{"label":"umustafi:umustafi/multipleTriggerPerJob","ref":"umustafi/multipleTriggerPerJob","sha":"781ea51035e4ccd6ea00e0090b7b7c7d48190a72","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2085\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nthe currently hard-coded `startToCloseTimeout` values are too short.  upon gaining operational experience, these requirements have come into focus:\r\n\r\n* `ProcessWorkUnits` must support extractors utilizing little parallelism (such as those reading from a DB) that take a very long time, even upwards of hours\r\n* `CommitActivity` runs may have to handle O(10k) or more task state files, which may take a long time to open and read, esp. when the `FileSystem` is under heavy load\r\n* `GenerateWorkUnits` must work with sources that may be quite vast, yet w/ limited recourse to parallelism, such as a massive source iceberg\r\n\r\nideally these and other temporal config values would be configurable.  that will come soon!  for now, bump to values large enough to resolve site-up concerns.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./gradlew build\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-12T02:47:46Z","updated_at":"2024-06-12T18:55:17Z","closed_at":"2024-06-12T18:55:17Z","merged_at":"2024-06-12T18:55:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"4df6a52d520b4c8718a5df5c71dcef1248b1161e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3970/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3970/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3970/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/ed32cc0f18bf6d4085b13199703fcbcf53f82b30","head":{"label":"phet:relax-temporal-starttoclose-timeout","ref":"relax-temporal-starttoclose-timeout","sha":"ed32cc0f18bf6d4085b13199703fcbcf53f82b30","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2071\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nManifest distcp often creates large file directory structures when copying files from one location to another. There is a risk when concurrently publishing files from a directory structure where the folders may not exist before renaming files, described by the javadoc:\r\n```\r\n* Renames a src {@link Path} on fs {@link FileSystem} to a dst {@link Path}. If fs is a {@link LocalFileSystem} and\r\n* src is a directory then {@link File#renameTo} is called directly to avoid a directory rename race condition where\r\n* {@link org.apache.hadoop.fs.RawLocalFileSystem#rename} copies the conflicting src directory into dst resulting in\r\n* an extra nested level, such as /root/a/b/c/e/e where e is repeated. \r\n```\r\nGiven that on HDFS it does not use a RawLocalFileSystem in many implementations, we want to pre-create the folders copied sequentially to safely create the folders before publishing the files.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes `SetPermissionCommitStep` to `CreateAndSetDirectoryPermissionCommitStep` which also creates folders BEFORE the commit is completed, instead of after.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nunit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-07T21:28:44Z","updated_at":"2024-06-10T22:21:40Z","closed_at":"2024-06-10T22:21:40Z","merged_at":"2024-06-10T22:21:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"8c3f326c0eef5f3a7e50c7cfee2d419af78ae1c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3966/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3966/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3966/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/6720eb66033f10b8cbec089961b9ca0df98b4e31","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:precreate-folders-before-recursive-rename","ref":"precreate-folders-before-recursive-rename","sha":"6720eb66033f10b8cbec089961b9ca0df98b4e31","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2017\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWhen there are multiple jobs to run next, DagProcs will write REEVALUATE dag action for each of the job.\r\n- So far, a REEVALUATE dag action assumed that the job is finished and it would launch the next jobs or cleanup the dag.\r\nThat's not the case anymore. Now REEVALUATE dag proc will check the job status, and if the status is finished, will proceed to launch next jobs or cleanup the dag. If the job status is not present, it would determine that the job was never started, and the dag action was created because of parallel jobs, and it will launch that job.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded tests in launchdagproctest and reevaluatedagproctest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-07T03:45:49Z","updated_at":"2024-06-12T01:08:34Z","closed_at":"2024-06-12T01:08:34Z","merged_at":"2024-06-12T01:08:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"227f39b0740d85b07e95f2fa87e7bcf0c834c5da","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3965/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3965/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3965/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4c6f756cb66350ce52488e5af3c19091d387d412","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:handlemultiple","ref":"handlemultiple","sha":"4c6f756cb66350ce52488e5af3c19091d387d412","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2079\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n`GaaSJobObservabilityEvents` currently encapsulate both jobs and flows in GaaS.\r\nThis is fine for single hop flows, but flows with multiple jobs encapsulated in them now have a mix of job level events with the majority of metadata, and flow level events which provide a better view to users when their flow fails at any given point.\r\n\r\nSince the data in both events differs vastly with most metadata only having contextual sense in the job level event, we should separate job and flow level events to their own respective event types.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a new type of event, called `GaaSFlowObservabilityEvent`, which contains the following metadata defined in this file: gobblin-metrics-libs/gobblin-metrics-base/src/main/avro/GaaSFlowObservabilityEvent.avsc\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-05T01:06:36Z","updated_at":"2024-07-30T00:28:34Z","closed_at":"2024-07-30T00:28:33Z","merged_at":"2024-07-30T00:28:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"981ec4f31027e69962984f1f63fb41a04f08dab8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/10c92954fdffb8735f2446fa4e0f5ff4ff358792","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:gaas-flow-observability-event-emission","ref":"gaas-flow-observability-event-emission","sha":"10c92954fdffb8735f2446fa4e0f5ff4ff358792","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2075\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nJob properties, and subsequently source and destination nodes are not found in the GaaSJobObservabilityEvent. More digging identified that the root cause is that `DagManagerUtils.getJobSpec` contained a bug where it would create a new Properties() object with\r\n```\r\nProperties clonedProperties = new Properties(oldProperties);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this is not accurate as the constructor https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html sets the input properties as the default, meaning that the keys would not exist when collecting the object, only when fetching keys that don't exist.\r\n\r\nSince this means that the configToProperties() in JobSpec is not reflective of configs, clone the object instead properly.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-30T23:02:17Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T15:39:24Z","closed_at":"2024-06-03T19:44:12Z","merged_at":"2024-06-03T19:44:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"290d17d6556b154ec4cbe8b99d9d2209e6d41588","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3956/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3956/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3956/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/88a964b2caf31223bea897121b3fa50a17467f2e","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-source-and-dest-identifier-keys-observability","ref":"fix-source-and-dest-identifier-keys-observability","sha":"88a964b2caf31223bea897121b3fa50a17467f2e","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn Manifest distcp, empty folders are being set with the incorrect permissions in SetPermissionStep after being correctly set in the CopyDataPublisher.\r\n\r\nThe suspected reason is that the empty child folders themselves are being treated as ancestors, and this causes the permission checking of the source and destination ancestors to act incorrectly. \r\n\r\nIn the long run, we should consolidate our permission comparison and logic given that there are a multitude of different implementations and they each seem to have their own quirks.\r\n\r\nCorrect CopyDataPublisher logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSetting destination directory hdfs://cluster/a/b/c owner and permission to rwxr-x---\r\n```\r\n\r\nIncorrect SetPermissionCommitStep logs:\r\n```\r\nSetting permission rwxr-xr-x on path /a/b/c\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-28T20:25:04Z","updated_at":"2024-06-05T18:47:06Z","closed_at":"2024-06-05T18:47:05Z","merged_at":"2024-06-05T18:47:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9874f16b73ef93d51bb880581d28ce43b46219e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/afc6edf2f70ffeb1fcb34f584d9c8ca4cd30b9f1","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-permission-issue-with-empty-dir-manifest-distcp","ref":"fix-permission-issue-with-empty-dir-manifest-distcp","sha":"afc6edf2f70ffeb1fcb34f584d9c8ca4cd30b9f1","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2071\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nCurrently, Gobblin-on-MR executions correctly forward their execution start time back to GaaS via the JobPrepareTimer.\r\n\r\nThe Temporal Gobblin job executions do not emit this event, thus the execution start time is 0 (epoch start). We need to forward this timer and submit it via Temporal.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested E2E on a Temporal pipeline and queried job status via GaaS API\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": {\r\n    \"flowGroup\": \"gaas-CLI\",\r\n    \"flowExecutionId\": 1716593541158,\r\n    \"flowName\": \"hxdMecLKPWrm\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"message\": \"\",\r\n  \"executionStatistics\": {\r\n    \"executionEndTime\": 1716595914707,\r\n    \"executionStartTime\": 1716593541158\r\n  },\r\n ```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-25T00:36:04Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T17:53:27Z","closed_at":"2024-05-28T18:29:41Z","merged_at":"2024-05-28T18:29:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea1233a31cd3b185aac2bd40d8e1139327873e9e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3953/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3953/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3953/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4fa4b1f9ae44c78c8e02701301ba208830ecbef1","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:add-execution-start-time-to-temporal","ref":"add-execution-start-time-to-temporal","sha":"4fa4b1f9ae44c78c8e02701301ba208830ecbef1","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2073\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAn event timestamp and reminder flag are used in conjunction with `DagActions` for lease arbitration and for reminder `dagActions`. It makes sense to create a new object `LeaseObject` with these fields and the `DagAction` object to easily transfer the information from one location to another. In particular for reminder events used to check back in on incomplete `dagAction` leases, these two fields are utilized and it's easiest to keep track of them when it's maintained within the `consensusDagAction` returned in a `LeaseAttemptStatus`\r\n\r\nBesides the refactoring the key piece in doing the bug fix is the following: storing `eventTimestamp` from the first `leaseAttemptStatus` in the `DagActionReminderScheduler` and using that when trying lease on reminder `MALA`. Otherwise it would use current ts as the `eventTimestamp` and treat every reminder as new event and do duplicate processing of `dagAction` once for original once for reminder (see DagActionReminderScheduler::execute and DagActionReminderScheduler::createReminderJobDetail)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUpdated tests that utilize these two fields\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-24T17:29:11Z","updated_at":"2024-06-17T19:16:22Z","closed_at":"2024-06-17T19:16:22Z","merged_at":"2024-06-17T19:16:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"c064604e4b804c9528a0b7365283b994acd071fc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3952/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3952/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3952/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5c6872c307090c4b567334236e2c990a965c3ed6","head":{"label":"umustafi:umustafi/handleReminderDagActions","ref":"umustafi/handleReminderDagActions","sha":"5c6872c307090c4b567334236e2c990a965c3ed6","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

flowExecutionId is different than the event time of the lease\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2070\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nWe are using the `flowExecutionId` from a `LeaseObtainedStatus` as the `eventTimestamp` to attempt to complete the lease at a later time. However, this only works for scheduled flows where we adopt the `consensus eventTimestamp` as the `flowExecutionId`. For adhoc flows, we do not update the id and the two values may be different so lease completion fails by the current owner of the lease. This PR keeps track of the  `eventTimestamp` from the lease arbiter to prevent any confusion. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-21T00:28:40Z","updated_at":"2024-05-21T20:58:21Z","closed_at":"2024-05-21T20:58:20Z","merged_at":"2024-05-21T20:58:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"083913de95bfce14cd3147f04ea79d5dee0c0f32","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3951/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3951/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3951/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f55061a9f064f6e95458239d2302740f4d7f5776","head":{"label":"umustafi:umustafi/malaBugFix","ref":"umustafi/malaBugFix","sha":"f55061a9f064f6e95458239d2302740f4d7f5776","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2069\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nAdd ENFORCE_FLOW_FINISH_DEADLINE dag action when a dag is submitted\r\nAdd ENFORCE_JOB_START_DEADLINE dag action when a job is submitted\r\ncreate triggers for both the new dag actions in DagManagementTaskStreamImpl when they are encountered for the first time\r\nimplement EnforceFlowFinishDeadlineDagProc\r\nimplement EnforceJobStartDeadlineDagProc\r\ndelete trigger and delete ENFORCE_FLOW_FINISH_DEADLINE when dag finishes\r\ndelete trigger and delete ENFORCE_JOB_START_DEADLINE when job starts\r\n\r\nWhen these dag procs are fetched from the DagtaskStreamImpl, they are not immediately processes; rather a reminder quartz trigger is created for the duration of job_start deadline time (in case of ENFORCE_JOB_START_DEADLINE dag action) and flow_flinish deadline time (in case of ENFORCE_FLOW_FINISH_DEADLINE dag action)\r\n\r\nAfter waiting, when the reminder trigger are fired again, they are processed just like any other dag action and job/dag is killed if the job has not started or the flow has not finished.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nadded EnforceDeadlineDagProcsTest\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-16T00:34:24Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T00:52:46Z","closed_at":"2024-05-23T00:52:46Z","merged_at":"2024-05-23T00:52:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"2837df2d53d860baf461bfb3d542d704663079a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3950/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3950/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3950/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/0de4ed458e6f5af5650113331eb7905cb7fc560b","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:deadline","ref":"deadline","sha":"0de4ed458e6f5af5650113331eb7905cb7fc560b","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2065\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nWe continue to face the \"Too many connections\" error while running `gobblin-service` tests; see, e.g. GH actions workflow failures for https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3944\r\n\r\nthis shows up as\r\n```\r\njava.io.IOException: Failure creation table TestDagStateStore\r\n   ...\r\nCaused by: java.sql.SQLNonTransientConnectionException: Too many connections\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdjusting the server variable `max_connections` (in [TestMetastoreDatabaseServer.java](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/compare/master...phet:gobblin:fix_gobblin-service_tests_too_many_connections?expand=1#diff-3a1f64166bc336495b2d153fe1f8bc0fdc9dd28450cb8de1d32578c2f2727517)) to `501` has fixed local execution.\r\n\r\nWhile debugging, I realized not all of the `@AfterClass` annotations use `(alwaysRun = true)`, so following on to the recent mods in https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3946\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nupdated tests herein\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-09T01:31:55Z","updated_at":"2024-05-09T17:26:46Z","closed_at":"2024-05-09T17:26:46Z","merged_at":"2024-05-09T17:26:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"c823e9883ef464c017a1b2b98362ba61b86446d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3948/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3948/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3948/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/71ccb306f655aa28984e83de566708c833416b45","head":{"label":"phet:fix_gobblin-service_tests_too_many_connections","ref":"fix_gobblin-service_tests_too_many_connections","sha":"71ccb306f655aa28984e83de566708c833416b45","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2067\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n1) do not try to get dags before during MostlyMySqlDagManagementStateStore initialization because this implementation does not need to update quota usage when the service restarts or when its leadership status changes because quota usage are persisted in mysql table.\r\nAlso, calling getDags during startUp may fail, because the topologies that are required to deserialize dags may not have been added to the topology catalog yet.\r\n2) provide an option to set GOBBLIN_SERVICE_GUICE_MODULE which is needed when GobblinServiceManager is created through Guice.\r\n3) do not start dag manager threads when dag proc engine is enabled, because a) dag manager threads are not required, b)create unnecessary GTEs that may interfere with jobs' execution\r\n4) increase column size for dag action table column for job_name\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-08T16:39:27Z","updated_at":"2024-05-15T21:45:00Z","closed_at":"2024-05-15T21:44:59Z","merged_at":"2024-05-15T21:44:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b2769f999582e2ed33c9201e7d4812ced672880","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3947/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3947/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3947/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/8d7f696213567dabb07d6fe812f78a986a525b24","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:dpetest","ref":"dpetest","sha":"8d7f696213567dabb07d6fe812f78a986a525b24","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

builder\r\n\r\nDear Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2064\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe GaaSObservabilityProducer uses    \r\n```\r\n .setJobProperties(GsonUtils.GSON_WITH_DATE_HANDLING.newBuilder().create().toJson(jobProperties))\r\n```\r\nbut this actually uses a newer version of GSON than the one defined in Gobblin and used in some client systems that rely on an earlier version of Gson. Since this fix is simple, we want to avoid version ambiguity when possible and use the API of the version that we define in Gobblin.\r\n```\r\n.setJobProperties(GsonUtils.GSON_WITH_DATE_HANDLING.toJson(jobProperties))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso cleanup some classnames to use the imported class rather than the fully qualified classname which intellij automatically uses when changing class names\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-08T01:02:25Z","updated_at":"2024-05-08T16:04:32Z","closed_at":"2024-05-08T16:04:31Z","merged_at":"2024-05-08T16:04:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"c1a09f0617590ef22092fb2c1e2db3b47c1de8c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3945/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3945/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3945/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9655ecb9f248bd489ba13fdeb5c372695ab73161","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:cleanup-imports-and-gson-builder-gaas-observability","ref":"cleanup-imports-and-gson-builder-gaas-observability","sha":"9655ecb9f248bd489ba13fdeb5c372695ab73161","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2062\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nthe Orchestrator + DagManager MUST remove adhoc flows from the FlowCatalog that fail compilation or violate concurrent execs. otherwise gaas will continue to return '409 Conflict' to each subsequent attempt to subsequently create an adhoc flow with the same flowGroup+flowName.  this is despite the fact that the flow (still remaining in the FlowCatalog, when it shouldn't be) already has the status of FAILED, which is a \"final status\".\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nadded test cases (herein)\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-05-06T19:59:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-12T01:41:07Z","closed_at":"2024-06-12T01:41:07Z","merged_at":"2024-06-12T01:41:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"8433913043e9106e59771e24f7c0876d891bbfed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3944/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3944/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3944/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/5593a8690b6c5d0cd83b71096f6590a551d5962d","head":{"label":"phet:multi-leader-adhoc-cleanup-from-catalog","ref":"multi-leader-adhoc-cleanup-from-catalog","sha":"5593a8690b6c5d0cd83b71096f6590a551d5962d","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2056\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\ntopologies are static and fixed. they can be initialized through configs. but right now we initialize them in spec compiler making spec compiler as a topology spec catalog listener and then wait for topology spec catalog to populate topologies.\r\nthis sometimes take longer time because it happens when some of the services' setActive is called. some newly created classes like DagManagementStateStore initialization may fail if topologies are not present by that time.\r\nso in this pr i am populating topologies sooner in spec compiler\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nupdated existing test cases\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2055\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nSince GaaS Opentelemetry is still in the early stages and hasn't been rolled out service-wide, it should not be configuring the opentelemetry instance as global otherwise it can run into the following errors when combined with existing servlet infrastructure that uses Opentelemetry as well:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: GlobalOpenTelemetry.set has already been called. GlobalOpenTelemetry.set must be called only once before any calls to GlobalOpenTelemetry.get. If you are using the OpenTelemetrySdk, use OpenTelemetrySdkBuilder.buildAndRegisterGlobal instead. Previous invocation set to cause of this exception.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince Opentelemetry is initialized here as a singleton, it should still be \"global\" in the sense that it's only initialized with one configuration in this class.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nPasses unit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2054\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nthus far, gobblin-on-temporal has only worked for iceberg-distcp (`CopySource`), not other job types that gobblin-on-MR succeeds with.  Commit fails with:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Missing required property writer.output.dir\r\n\tat com.google.common.base.Preconditions.checkArgument(Preconditions.java:122)\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.util.WriterUtils.getWriterOutputDir(WriterUtils.java:121)\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.publisher.BaseDataPublisher.publishData(BaseDataPublisher.java:390)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nthat prop was already used just prior to commit, while processing the `WorkUnit`, so something is clearly off...\r\n\r\nstill, even after hard-coding that property, this later error arises:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Can not create a Path from a null string\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path.checkPathArg(Path.java:159)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path.<init>(Path.java:175)\r\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.fs.Path.<init>(Path.java:110)\r\n\tat org.apache.gobblin.runtime.FsDatasetStateStore.sanitizeDatasetStatestoreNameFromDatasetURN(FsDatasetStateStore.java:175)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nupon investigation, these were due to two aspects of the gobblin-on-MR impl that did not carry over to gobblin-on-temporal:\r\n1. the `JobState` must be added back to the `TaskState`, when the latter is deserialized, since only `CopySource::FileSetWorkUnitGenerator` adds all `JobState` props to the `WorkUnit`s it creates.  without that `JobState` props are not serialized with the `TaskState`\r\n2. every `JobState.DatasetState` must be given a non-`null` `jobName`\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nmanual execution using `org.apache.gobblin.source.extractor.extract.jdbc.MysqlSource`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-24T20:31:01Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T15:28:02Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T15:28:02Z","merged_at":"2024-04-25T15:28:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"77f9d3896c7b6249fca52e481d4f62bce0a06831","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3934/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3934/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3934/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/1603a939fc10f95b1c561d8aa0fa9192e5b51ae0","head":{"label":"phet:fix-CommitActivityImpl","ref":"fix-CommitActivityImpl","sha":"1603a939fc10f95b1c561d8aa0fa9192e5b51ae0","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [GOBBLIN-2052](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2052) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2052\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following issue:\r\n- [ ] We have observed that some of the times the helix task is being stuck in INIT state in container where there is mismatch observed between the state of helix task at GAM (controller) and participant end. At participant end on receiving the state transition message to go from INIT -> RUNNING, since there is a mismatch, the message keeps on getting dropped. This is causing topic/partition starvation. This is actually issue on helix side but this is more of a workaround to check if any partition is stuck in INIT state for so long. \r\n- [ ]   This pr checks for helix participant that contains partition that is being in INIT state (default can be configurable) for more than configured amount of time (timeout) and releases the corresponding container. This will ensure that the helix participant will be assigned new container which will create a new session with zk of helix and hopefully the issue might be remediated.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the unit tests in YarnAutoScalingManagerTest file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-23T03:58:21Z","updated_at":"2024-05-30T17:14:28Z","closed_at":"2024-05-30T17:14:28Z","merged_at":"2024-05-30T17:14:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"2a8e3ec8e22c2394f0f274d9bc593aea4214621a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3932/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3932/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3932/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4fd5a1e3b5efc6b0e5c4005e66b5bb39ce87825f","head":{"label":"pradeepppc:remove-container-in-which-helix-task-is-stuck-in-INIT-state","ref":"remove-container-in-which-helix-task-is-stuck-in-INIT-state","sha":"4fd5a1e3b5efc6b0e5c4005e66b5bb39ce87825f","user":{"login":"pradeepppc","id":26819007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODE5MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26819007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc","html_url":"https://github.com/pradeepppc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":763999889,"node_id":"R_kgDOLYm2kQ","name":"gobblin","full_name":"pradeepppc/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pradeepppc","id":26819007,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2ODE5MDA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26819007?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc","html_url":"https://github.com/pradeepppc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pradeepppc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pradeepppc/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2050\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nGobblin Yarn Application Launcher has some issues where directories used for the job can persist after the job ends. It also creates a number of temporary files which can grow out of control.\r\n\r\nThis PR creates a new instance of a file system for cleaning up as the previous filesystem instance gets closed by the Yarn application and the cache becomes problematic with mount table FS.\r\nIt also allows a user to define `gobblin.cluster.absolute.workDir` for the exact path their cluster temp files and jars are stored, and `gobblin.yarn.token.file.path` to determine where to store their yarn security token.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTested E2E and did not see regressions\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-19T16:49:07Z","updated_at":"2024-04-25T15:05:35Z","closed_at":"2024-04-25T15:05:34Z","merged_at":"2024-04-25T15:05:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"773da768f6c01b527a4dd74f4195e265c2eaf4df","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3931/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3931/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3931/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/a194440e4e98128111356f36faf17bd956694f40","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:cleanup-yarn-app-work-dir-when-detached-fs-closed","ref":"cleanup-yarn-app-work-dir-when-detached-fs-closed","sha":"a194440e4e98128111356f36faf17bd956694f40","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2049\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nGobblin `safeSetPathPermission` does not throw an exception when setting permissions fail on a path. We want to change this behavior especially for use cases like manifest distcp where hundreds of thousands of files are involved in a distcp job and permission settings are important to replicate correctly as they cannot be updated or verified by hand. \r\nThis PR adds a new configuration to fail writing or publishing tasks when the job is configured to report success when permissions are not replicated properly. The default behavior remains the same as before to allow the job to succeed without this for backwards compatibility. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-18T21:05:35Z","updated_at":"2024-04-19T01:42:41Z","closed_at":"2024-04-19T01:42:40Z","merged_at":"2024-04-19T01:42:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"62f645c586499808956ea9346753777628d52a92","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3929/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3929/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3929/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/be05f2b53dab39116e49b874c66a43c63ef5b373","head":{"label":"umustafi:umustafi/failDistcpWriterForPermissions","ref":"umustafi/failDistcpWriterForPermissions","sha":"be05f2b53dab39116e49b874c66a43c63ef5b373","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2046\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nthere are many kinds of `WorkUnit`, beyond the `CopyEntity` produced by `CopySource`.\r\n\r\nas it remains helpful, continue to log `CopyEntity`-specific info, but do so w/o suggesting something is missing when the WU is not a `CopyEntity`\r\n\r\nin addition, add logging to `GobblinYarnAppLauncher::addAppMasterLocalResources` for a rough indication of where this lengthy phase of pre-launch init is spending so much time\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nmanually executed `CopyEntity`-workload and non-`CopyEntity`-workload and verified intended logging\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-17T16:43:32Z","updated_at":"2024-04-18T21:45:08Z","closed_at":"2024-04-18T21:45:08Z","merged_at":"2024-04-18T21:45:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"b57ecbcf4cf80e8e7b58bee74224cf12da566cf6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3925/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3925/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3925/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/22c7d3ee7ae8d7676fb0f98587e8c3ed560b31fd","head":{"label":"phet:CopyEntity-agnostic-procWU-logging","ref":"CopyEntity-agnostic-procWU-logging","sha":"22c7d3ee7ae8d7676fb0f98587e8c3ed560b31fd","user":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":388318146,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODgzMTgxNDY=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"phet/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"phet","id":813127,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMzEyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/813127?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet","html_url":"https://github.com/phet","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/phet/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/phet/gobblin","description":"A

The orchestrator's spec compiler is set to being active but the compiler in the flow compilation validation class is never set to be active. This will block any classes that depend on the flow compilation validation helper (e.g. DagActionChangeStoreMonitor).\r\n\r\nThis change consolidates spec compiler creation to the validation helper, and references the validation helper from the orchestrator which makes sense as it is being shared with both the compiler and the dag action monitor.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRan locally, validated guice bindings work\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nDagActionChangeStoreMonitor will try to load all the dag actions in the mysql db on startup and submit them to the dagmanager.\r\n\r\nSometimes there are issues during this startup process that can cause errors, we want to handle these issues gracefully and not block the dag action change monitor from initialization, otherwise it will block any dags from being processed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-10T19:51:09Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T20:23:40Z","closed_at":"2024-04-11T20:23:39Z","merged_at":"2024-04-11T20:23:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"19d1620d873ff5a5cf3f6b1993fff5ddf340653d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3918/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3918/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3918/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4959918d545ef5faaf8e7421af31a21a36df2628","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:handle-failure-scenarios-multileader-compilation-startup","ref":"handle-failure-scenarios-multileader-compilation-startup","sha":"4959918d545ef5faaf8e7421af31a21a36df2628","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2037\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe `DagActionStoreChangeMonitor` cannot be started before the `Flowgraph, DagManager, and SpecCompiler` are up and running. When the monitor is initialized by Guice, it was previously also starting to load dagActions from the store immediately to compile and process. There is a race condition created where the actions can be loaded too quickly from the store and passed to the `specCompiler` before it's ready. The `SpecCompiler` hangs waiting for the `flowGraph` to load, causing startup to fail. A similar dependency exists between the `SpecStoreChangeMonitor` and `SpecCompiler` + `Scheduler`. \r\n\r\nThe solution is the bind the monitor in Guice but only enable processing of actions and specs after the `GobblinServiceManager` ensures other classes are ready to be called by the `DagActionStoreChangeMonitor` & `SpecStoreChangeMonitor`. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTest a local deployment\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-05T21:04:52Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T22:11:52Z","closed_at":"2024-04-05T22:11:52Z","merged_at":"2024-04-05T22:11:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"1ca4944359fae3a7348a56427a2c38555811e977","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3916/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3916/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3916/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/4bd58eb80de2ea3ff2de15ca902819a4540820b5","head":{"label":"umustafi:umustafi/moveDagActionMonitorStartup","ref":"umustafi/moveDagActionMonitorStartup","sha":"4bd58eb80de2ea3ff2de15ca902819a4540820b5","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2036\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe old value of `flow.allowConcurrentExecution` is set as a string value in the flow configuration jsons, but in the code we parse it as boolean. Instead we want to parse as string then convert to boolean to make this backwards compatible with existing flow configs.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-04T01:02:54Z","updated_at":"2024-04-04T18:31:15Z","closed_at":"2024-04-04T18:31:14Z","merged_at":"2024-04-04T18:31:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"3dffd9c3913c1fddb08a5a238f63e5491df12722","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3915/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3915/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3915/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/fbd7ef426dd5135617e78bce3607cbb2ffce7f02","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:fix-type-error-allow-concurrent-exec","ref":"fix-type-error-allow-concurrent-exec","sha":"fbd7ef426dd5135617e78bce3607cbb2ffce7f02","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [GOBBLIN-2026](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2026) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n   - Currently in the cleaner job, if OOM error or any exception occurs in the cleaner job, the flow is terminated successfully. Why? \r\n   - This is due to a race condition in Data cleaner job, where the `close()` waits for the countDownLatch to be 0, and when the cleaner job onFailure Method counts it down to 0. There is a race condition, where the close() method checks for the `throwables` which is empty, as the failure() method has not added the throwable in this list. Thus, the exception which was supposed to be thrown is never thrown. Resulting in the process to be completed successfully. \r\n   - Due to the changes done in [PR](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/pull/3883) the log where no deletable version exists was being printed for every 100 datasets. This PR avoids writing log when there are no deletable versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"","created_at":"2024-04-02T03:44:56Z","updated_at":"2024-04-05T16:42:46Z","closed_at":"2024-04-05T16:42:46Z","merged_at":"2024-04-05T16:42:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"577933891f2621b68244598c63dd041864363f97","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3913/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3913/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3913/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/c9b5c0a2d1962d35491521fb726cb984bc3b9a4e","head":{"label":"arpit09:failonOOM","ref":"failonOOM","sha":"c9b5c0a2d1962d35491521fb726cb984bc3b9a4e","user":{"login":"arpit09","id":9762455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjI0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9762455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09","html_url":"https://github.com/arpit09","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":754462131,"node_id":"R_kgDOLPgtsw","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arpit09/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arpit09","id":9762455,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NjI0NTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9762455?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09","html_url":"https://github.com/arpit09","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arpit09/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arpit09/gobblin","description":"A

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2066\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nTemporal workflows can have added observability metrics so that workflows can be easily understood at-a-glance which is an improvement over the current Gobblin system.\r\n\r\nWe want to provide the following:\r\n1. Emit dataset-level metrics on job metadata as a GobblinTrackingEvent (to reach feature parity with existing Gobblin)\r\n2. Enhance return types on Temporal so that users and service operators can easily view metadata on jobs being run, so that it becomes obvious when a job actually commits work and to which datasets without checking the logs.\r\n\r\nThis PR will add metadata to the ExecuteGobblinWorkflow so that the return type will also report the following metadata.\r\n1. Number of workunits generated\r\n2. Number of workunits committed \r\n3. Dataset URNs modified\r\n4. Files and Bytes written at a per-dataset level\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    5. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    6. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    7. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    8. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-01T23:55:27Z","updated_at":"2024-05-23T20:40:37Z","closed_at":"2024-05-23T20:40:36Z","merged_at":"2024-05-23T20:40:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"cc54cbb245c8249dfacf185bbf37f37e6b7791ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3912/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3912/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3912/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/f1df0dc46f88358e5c558265d1b6a502621a136e","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:report-dataset-metrics-summary","ref":"report-dataset-metrics-summary","sha":"f1df0dc46f88358e5c558265d1b6a502621a136e","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2032\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nIn Gobblin cluster, there is a configuration to set the log sink in order to create a log copier service which copies logs to HDFS from Yarn cluster.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the configuration for log dir sinks optional so that the application does not need to set up a log copying service. Additionally it makes the file name suffix configurable in case the user wants a non-stdout file.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nRan E2E, confirms it works without log dir sinks set up.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-01T21:40:12Z","updated_at":"2024-04-08T20:10:26Z","closed_at":"2024-04-08T20:10:25Z","merged_at":"2024-04-08T20:10:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"698b351d4104167fc7a700fa08ee3102b20e2adc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3911/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3911/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3911/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/b08ad65948deedc00c94e828ba5a76c9578cb93c","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:make-log-sink-config-optional","ref":"make-log-sink-config-optional","sha":"b08ad65948deedc00c94e828ba5a76c9578cb93c","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2033\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR allows appending taskAttemptId + timestamp to writer output directory to make writer output directory unique for each task.\r\nContext for this change is there is a chance that some corrupted files could be created when previous tasks were interrupted. To avoid moving orphan files from previous run, each task should have a unique writer output and corrupted files will not be picked up.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUnit test added:\r\nKafkaStreamingExtractorTest.testWriteOutputDirUpdate\r\n- verified if config.WRITER_OUTPUT_DIR_UPDATE_ENABLED is set to false, there is no change to taskOutput dir\r\n- verified if config.WRITER_OUTPUT_DIR_UPDATE_ENABLED is set to true, taskAttemptId is appened to taskOutput\r\n\r\nend to end test performed:\r\n1. verified data is renamed into desired taskOutput path:\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 3 47 52 PM](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/7811200/228d48fd-2ed1-4b85-920c-73f626751e67)\r\n\r\n2. verified data is published into destination path:\r\n![Screenshot 2024-04-10 at 3 48 43 PM](https://github.com/apache/gobblin/assets/7811200/e1cbd9f3-f001-4542-ac85-7f993d978c52)\r\n\r\n3. verified in container log below log exists:\r\n```\r\n2024-04-10 15:41:48 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.writer.FsDataWriter  - Renaming /data/ci_parallel/tracking/streaming_parallel_test/MemberScrapingScoreEvent/.temp/taskStaging/KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest/job_KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest_1712788508681/MemberScrapingScoreEvent/GobblinYarnTaskRunner_10/hourly/2024/04/10/15/part.task_KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest_1712788508681_8_1712788607706_0.orc to /data/ci_parallel/tracking/streaming_parallel_test/MemberScrapingScoreEvent/.temp/taskStaging/KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest/job_KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest_1712788508681/MemberScrapingScoreEvent/GobblinYarnTaskRunner_10/hourly/2024/04/10/15/part.task_KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest_1712788508681_8_1712788607706_0.503234.orc\r\n2024-04-10 15:41:48 PDT INFO  [StreamModelTaskRunner] org.apache.gobblin.writer.FsDataWriter  - Moving data from /data/ci_parallel/tracking/streaming_parallel_test/MemberScrapingScoreEvent/.temp/taskStaging/KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest/job_KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest_1712788508681/MemberScrapingScoreEvent/GobblinYarnTaskRunner_10/hourly/2024/04/10/15/part.task_KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest_1712788508681_8_1712788607706_0.503234.orc to /data/ci_parallel/tracking/streaming_parallel_test/MemberScrapingScoreEvent/.temp/taskOutput/KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest/job_KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest_1712788508681/8/GobblinYarnTaskRunner_10_1712788607773/MemberScrapingScoreEvent/hourly/2024/04/10/15/part.task_KafkaHdfsStreamingTrackingOrcRongTest_1712788508681_8_1712788607706_0.503234.orc\r\n``` \r\n4.

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    6. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    7. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    8. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    9. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-04-01T19:05:30Z","updated_at":"2024-04-11T00:09:11Z","closed_at":"2024-04-11T00:09:11Z","merged_at":"2024-04-11T00:09:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"4610f895f8aa9bda51259a48025d7a039f09a25e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3910/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3910/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3910/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/3136410e8a4caac2473d01aeb74e420d014fa2ac","head":{"label":"rongshen:master","ref":"master","sha":"3136410e8a4caac2473d01aeb74e420d014fa2ac","user":{"login":"rongshen","id":7811200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTEyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7811200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen","html_url":"https://github.com/rongshen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":767110746,"node_id":"R_kgDOLbkuWg","name":"gobblin","full_name":"rongshen/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rongshen","id":7811200,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4MTEyMDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7811200?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen","html_url":"https://github.com/rongshen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rongshen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rongshen/gobblin","description":"A

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2027\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThis PR will move DagActionStore, MultiActiveLeaseArbiter and their implementation/test classes from gobblin-runtime to gobblin-service module, because DagAction is a concept used exclusively in Gobblin Service, not in core gobblin.\r\nAlso move `LeaseAttemptStatus` out of `MultiActiveLeaseArbiter` class.\r\n\r\nThis change also helped add a method `getDagNodeId()` in `DagAction` class, which would otherwise not be possible due to circular dependencies between the modules. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-27T19:53:46Z","updated_at":"2024-03-28T02:40:24Z","closed_at":"2024-03-28T02:40:24Z","merged_at":"2024-03-28T02:40:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"2bc6f8773f09ff7eb31560b5569021bd0fd044c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3904/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3904/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3904/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/49aa9aca0adbaa19e3ecc6cb8dc00c47b212f30f","head":{"label":"arjun4084346:dagactionstore","ref":"dagactionstore","sha":"49aa9aca0adbaa19e3ecc6cb8dc00c47b212f30f","user":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83587790,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzU4Nzc5MA==","name":"gobblin","full_name":"arjun4084346/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"arjun4084346","id":14981564,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTgxNTY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14981564?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346","html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/arjun4084346/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/arjun4084346/gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2025\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nFor some use cases of predicates, we want an `alwaysFalse` semantic. Normally this is easy to import from Guava via `Predicate.alwaysFalse()` but due to Gobblin relying on classloading this is not feasible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTrivial class added that can only be enabled via configuration\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-25T22:36:33Z","updated_at":"2024-03-25T23:27:32Z","closed_at":"2024-03-25T23:27:32Z","merged_at":"2024-03-25T23:27:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"ed66943824c96a591bf53c071f0be1f086e5ef62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3903/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3903/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3903/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/9c14d5acedb12ebec134e88f73cec2615a6932d1","head":{"label":"Will-Lo:add-always-false-predicate","ref":"add-always-false-predicate","sha":"9c14d5acedb12ebec134e88f73cec2615a6932d1","user":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206628556,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY2Mjg1NTY=","name":"incubator-gobblin","full_name":"Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Will-Lo","id":6377154,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNzcxNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6377154?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo","html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Will-Lo/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Will-Lo/incubator-gobblin","description":"Gobblin is a distributed big data integration framework (ingestion, replication, compliance, retention)  for batch and streaming systems.

After benchmark, we identify that we can improve the computeSpec part to reduce the duplicate work, also we can add the file size information in GMCE to avoid calling HDFS for each file. \r\nWith this change, I verified that we can now process more than 7000 messages/minute vs 1000 messages/minute before the change.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntested by running both ingestion and metadata pipelines, and verify to adopt this change, we need to apply change to metadata pipeline first.  \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2020\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\n\r\nThere are a few bugs in Gobblin-Temporal execution mode:\r\n1. If the publishing step fails, the activity does not report a failure due to missing a step post commit to check the dataset states\r\n2. No GTEs are emitted upon job failure, which makes tracking difficult\r\n3. Some metadata propagation for flow execution ID with workflows is incorrect due to a bug reading worker configs instead of job props\r\n4. The GenerateWus activity does not return the right number of workunits created due to counting top level multiworkunits\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the above 4 issues and resolves them\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nConfirmed that flows can actually fail due to failed commits, number of tasks processed by workunit generation and task processing is matching, concurrent flows will read from job Props and not worker configs which lead to duplicate workflow name conflicts.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Gobblin maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Gobblin JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[GOBBLIN-XXX] My Gobblin PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GOBBLIN-2019\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots (if applicable):\r\nThe following PR removes a circular dependency between `dagManagementTaskStream` & `ReminderSettingDagProcLeaseArbiter` where  `dagManagementTaskStream` uses `ReminderSettingDagProcLeaseArbiter` to obtain lease, if it fails to obtain lease then the `ReminderSettingDagProcLeaseArbiter` was setting reminder on `DagActionReminderScheduler` and when reminder fires add the action back to `dagManagementTaskStream`. To remove circular dependency, I remove the `ReminderSettingDagProcLeaseArbiter` and use the more generic `InstrumentedLeaseArbiter` that will only provide the status. Instead,  `dagManagementTaskStream` will call `DagActionReminderScheduler` to set reminders. The `DagActionReminderScheduler` does reference `dagManagement` to re-add to the stream by referencing the singleton instance of the class. \r\n\r\nOther changes include\r\n\r\n- refactor `MySqlMultiActiveLeaseArbiter` and it's initialization to specify table names through a prefix to differentiate btwn multiple instances \r\n- add `jobName` to `dagActionChangeEvent`\r\n- Delete `dagAction` before concluding lease\r\n- Use lease arbiter in single-active execution mode in DagProcessing mode\r\n- \r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-03-21T00:05:39Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T20:15:16Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T20:15:16Z","merged_at":"2024-03-29T20:15:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"e2655cf326eac1f5401e3b65c703efcd68621974","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3899/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/3899/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/issues/3899/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/gobblin/statuses/275e0c81b7880185a3b92bafa141deac1afd766d","head":{"label":"umustafi:removeCircularDependencyMultiActiveExecution","ref":"removeCircularDependencyMultiActiveExecution","sha":"275e0c81b7880185a3b92bafa141deac1afd766d","user":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349503799,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk1MDM3OTk=","name":"gobblin","full_name":"umustafi/gobblin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"umustafi","id":22552096,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTUyMDk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22552096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi","html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umustafi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/umustafi/gobblin","description":"A
