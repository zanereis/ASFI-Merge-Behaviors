alias):\r\n\r\n![executor_curl_api_request](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/c13fee9a-759e-4636-b797-36d46f0be5f3)\r\n\r\n![executor_webserver_task_details_api](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/ea44b79c-779f-482b-8765-a1f8e9814067)\r\n\r\n#### Second task run without an executor override (so the default executor is used):\r\n\r\n![executor_webserver_task_details_api_no_exec_override](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/935ca7bc-efd6-4e86-b86a-47366ee0d8d4)\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache

test occasionally fails.  On occasion, delete_data_source takes a little longer on the service side and it tries to delete files in the S3 Bucket **after** the delete_bucket operator already has.  This causes delete_data_source to fail which in turn causes delete_knowledge_base to fail, leaving stranded artifacts in the account.\r\n\r\nSetting the Data Source retention policy to \"RETAIN\" means delete_data_source will not try to delete the files, and delete_bucket can safely do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n@syedahsn - This is the bug I mentioned earlier, and the fix for it.\r\n\r\n##

https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/40018\r\n\r\nSee linked issue for a detailed explanation. The fix in this PR makes sure we always check the pod state before checking the trigger timeout. \r\n\r\nThis may, in some cases, add an unnecessary call to the K8s API (trigger timed out and pod is in fact still pending), but I think that is preferable to the alternative where we fail a task even though the pod completed successfully (most likely an expensive execution since `deferrable=True`).\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-03T05:21:38Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T11:13:26Z","closed_at":"2024-06-03T11:13:26Z","merged_at":"2024-06-03T11:13:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"981ba8f00544597863448f1b951cdd8c5bc6a023","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hussein-awala","id":21311487,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzExNDg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21311487?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala","html_url":"https://github.com/hussein-awala","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hussein-awala/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"romsharon98","id":33751805,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzNzUxODA1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33751805?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98","html_url":"https://github.com/romsharon98","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/romsharon98/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"amoghrajesh","id":35884252,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1ODg0MjUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35884252?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh","html_url":"https://github.com/amoghrajesh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/amoghrajesh/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1697155831,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjk3MTU1ODMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:providers","name":"area:providers","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2504183113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTA0MTgzMTEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:cncf-kubernetes","name":"provider:cncf-kubernetes","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Kubernetes

change delivers the main portion of hybrid executors to the Airflow scheduler. Each loop the query for TIs from the DB may contain TIs tagged with any executor (or no specific executor, which means run on the default executor). We now sort those TIs by executor after the query and queue tasks for the executors which have space to take on more TIs.\r\n\r\nWe now also heartbeat all executors and process their events each scheduler loop.\r\n\r\nThis is a second version of these changes which are fairly concise in source code diff. Most of the PR is testing changes/additions.\r\n\r\n## Benchmarking\r\nHere is some benchmarking to show performance of the scheduler with the changes.\r\nPlease refer to the orange (90th quantile) and yellow/green (50th quantile) plots, blue is the 99th quantile which leads to very spikey data.\r\n\r\nImportant plots include the bottom two (which are the critical sections of the main loop), as well as the loop duration as a whole.\r\n\r\n### Baseline from main\r\n  \r\n![baseline_1](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/20bd7b2b-c4cd-46e9-bed2-ef744720ae8e)\r\n\r\n![baseline_2](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/a6df2f79-698e-4299-8165-d6a9a3fb0942)\r\n\r\n### Hybrid Scheduler\r\n\r\n![hybrid_1](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/69936280-9b13-472d-9866-7d0f7011042a)\r\n\r\n![hybrid_2](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/d9797d8f-aa75-445e-b4dc-d3be11e643dc)\r\n\r\n### Method:\r\nThis data was collected while running the below DAG. Leveraging the standard Airflow metrics along with some metric math (for example the scheduler loop time minus the executor heartbeat time, middle-left plot), using statsd and grafana within the same breeze environment for all data collection.\r\n\r\nMore samples were taken than just the runs included above, but a representative selection was chosen.\r\n\r\n### DAG code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nfrom airflow.models import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom airflow.operators.empty import EmptyOperator\r\n\r\ninitial_scale = 4\r\nmax_scale = 5\r\nscaling_factor = 2\r\ndag_id = \"for_loop_tasks_80\"\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=dag_id,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    schedule_interval=\"@once\",\r\n    start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),\r\n    max_active_runs=1,\r\n) as dag:\r\n    start = EmptyOperator(task_id=\"start\")\r\n    end = EmptyOperator(task_id=\"end\")\r\n    for i in range(80):\r\n        task = BashOperator(task_id=f\"task_{i}\", bash_command=\"date\")\r\n        start >> task >> end\r\n```\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

pull request introduces the [DatabricksTaskOperator](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-provider-databricks/blob/main/src/astro_databricks/operators/common.py#L26) \r\nto the Airflow Databricks provider from the [astro-provider-databricks](https://github.com/astronomer/astro-provider-databricks/tree/main)\r\nrepository. Unlike the `DatabricksNotebookOperator` which only\r\nallows to run Notebook tasks, the `DatabricksTaskOperator` allows\r\nrunning all kinds of tasks across a wide range of types including \r\nnotebooks, JAR files, Python scripts, Databricks SQL queries \r\nand dashboards, Delta Live Tables pipelines, dbt tasks and more\r\nthat are supported by the [Jobs API in its tasks attribute](https://docs.databricks.com/api/workspace/jobs/create#tasks).\r\n\r\nIt marks another pull request aimed at contributing  operators \r\nand features from that repository into the Airflow  Databricks \r\nprovider. This PR also abstracts the common implementation\r\nbetween the `DatabricksNotebookOperator` and \r\n`DatabricksTaskOperator` into a base abstract class \r\n`DatabricksTaskBaseOperator` so that we do not introduce \r\nduplicate code for the common set of implementation methods.\r\n\r\nExample successful run of a DAG using the \r\n`DatabricksTaskOperator` with the implementation from this PR\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1699\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-06-03 at 1 44 04 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/10206082/26cefd4c-c965-4a13-a36e-bcce92522c81\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This is useful for local testing of dags which contain dependencies on external systems/dagruns (e.g. through sensors), or which would overwrite some data in a central system, or which would cleanup files needed for debugging.\r\nI implemented this via marking tasks as success instead of using \"skipping\", since by default skips propagate downstream, so later tasks would not be executed.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nairflow dags test example_sensor_decorator --mark-success-pattern \"wait_for_upstream\"\r\n\r\nairflow dags test dag_with_many_dependencies

noticed that we have some example plugins we ship in our source code, but so far we are limited not being able to \"eat our own dog-food\" with the example DAGs. Plugins so far needed to be deployed by deployment manager.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the plugin manager slightly in the way that plugins contained in example DAGs folder in source are loaded as well when example DAGs are loaded.\r\n\r\nThis enables us(in separate PRs in future... soon?) to really use timetables in the example DAGs and not only have code examples linked in documentation.\r\n\r\nFYI @hussein-awala I remember you also had a hard time making an example working in our PR

If a broker exists as an independent provider that has its own integration tests, we could import the service from the `integration-<PROVIDER>.yml` into the `integration-celery.yml` using

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug that makes `AirflowSecurityManagerV2` leave some transactions in the `idle in transaction` state.\r\n\r\nThe problem is due to the combined usage of the `@cached_property` and `@provide_session` decorators on top of the `_auth_manager_is_authorized_map` method: the `@cached_property` decorator makes the `create_session` context manager get consumed and not be available to wrap the nested functions.\r\n\r\nThe fix presented here just makes sure each of the resource-retrieving nested functions in `_auth_manager_is_authorized_map` can use a session object with a clean state.\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nThis problem affects views that perform fine-grained access checks using resource ID (for example, editing variables, editing connections, etc).\r\n\r\nApart from the negative impact of having orphaned transactions in the `idle in transaction` state, this problem also may lead to `sqlalchemy.exc.PendingRollbackError` exceptions whilst trying to edit a resource.\r\n\r\nThe sqlalchemy pool (using the default settings) seems to just chug along reusing the connections that have orphaned transactions, until they get invalidated. Then, if the `Session` object that is automatically passed to the security manager's nested functions gets to use one of those invalidated connections, an exception like the following is thrown:\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 2529, in wsgi_app\r\n    response = self.full_dispatch_request()\r\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1825, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.handle_user_exception(e)\r\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1823, in full_dispatch_request\r\n    rv = self.dispatch_request()\r\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/flask/app.py\", line 1799, in dispatch_request\r\n    return self.ensure_sync(self.view_functions[rule.endpoint])(**view_args)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/www/decorators.py\", line 159, in wrapper\r\n    return f(*args, **kwargs)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/www/auth.py\", line 110, in wraps\r\n    if permission_str in self.base_permissions and self.appbuilder.sm.has_access(\r\n                                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/www/security_manager.py\", line 142, in has_access\r\n    return is_authorized_method(action_name, resource_pk, user)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/www/security_manager.py\", line 318, in <lambda>\r\n    details=VariableDetails(key=get_variable_key(resource_pk)),\r\n                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/airflow/www/security_manager.py\", line 227, in get_variable_key\r\n    variable = session.scalar(select(Variable).where(Variable.id == resource_pk).limit(1))\r\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/session.py\", line 1747, in scalar\r\n    return self.execute(\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/session.py\", line 1717, in execute\r\n    result = conn._execute_20(statement, params or {}, execution_options)\r\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1710, in _execute_20\r\n    return meth(self, args_10style, kwargs_10style, execution_options)\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlalchemy/sql/elements.py\", line 334, in _execute_on_connection\r\n    return connection._execute_clauseelement(\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1577, in _execute_clauseelement\r\n    ret = self._execute_context(\r\n          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 1808, in _execute_context\r\n    conn = self._revalidate_connection()\r\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 650, in _revalidate_connection\r\n    self._invalid_transaction()\r\n  File \"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/sqlalchemy/engine/base.py\", line 622, in _invalid_transaction\r\n    raise exc.PendingRollbackError(\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.PendingRollbackError: Can't reconnect until invalid transaction is rolled back. (Background on this error at: https://sqlalche.me/e/14/8s2b)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTweaking the sqlalchemy pool settings and using pgbouncer also seem to play a role in mitigating this issue. In any case, there are already some users reporting errors editing resources. See https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/39581.\r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with the connection invalidation mechanisms within sqlalchemy pools, but that's definitely a component in generating errors like the above.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon this problem in a Postgres-based environment after upgrading to Airflow 2.9.1 (Python 3.11). I don't know if other DB backends are equally affected.\r\n\r\n## Reproducing\r\n\r\n1. Spin up an Airflow environment using the official docker-compose file\r\n2. Make the adjustments to gain access to the postgres container from your local machine\r\n3. Monitor the `idle in transaction` transactions:\r\n```sh\r\nwatch -n 1 'psql postgresql://airflow:airflow@postgres-container/airflow -P pager=off -c \"select * from pg_stat_activity where state = '\"'idle in transaction'\"'\"'\r\n```\r\n4.

#39527\r\nrelated: #39527\r\n\r\nThis PR is like POC of the approach. The main point is to return the renderer information for the template field to UI and let react syntax highlighter module use the info to apply appropriate language syntax highlighting. There are four changes\r\n\r\n1. To get the renderers the task needs to be retrieved from dagbag which in turn needs the existing session attached to be passed to get_dag or else the new session created will commit and cause the one attached to task_instance during serialization to become stale.\r\n2. Earlier the rendered_fields will return only the value and now it will return {\"value\": value, \"renderer\": renderer} which though defined as a dictionary without structure might break scripts using it. \r\n3. Since configuration.query.query which is also a rendered field previously it was not returned in API but visible in the legacy page. Such nested paths are also now returned in the API.\r\n4. Rendered template fields should be rendered as it is and not converted to camelcase which is also fixed here by excluding nested keys when rendered_fields key is present in response.\r\n\r\nThoughts welcome on the change and possible approaches.\r\n\r\nBefore PR : \r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"rendered_fields\": {\r\n    \"configuration\": {\r\n        \"query\": {\r\n          \"query\": \"INSERT INTO

},\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith PR : \r\n\r\n```\r\n  \"rendered_fields\": {\r\n    \"configuration\": {\r\n      \"renderer\": \"json\",\r\n      \"value\": {\r\n        \"query\": {\r\n          \"query\":

`LocalTaskJobRunner` kills worker processes after they have their state set to `SUCCESS` and are still running. This can happen in few ways - most common are either state is set externally, or there are relatively slow listeners or other processes (mini scheduler) running. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces mechanism in which  we give the task some additional to finish their job - by default 20 seconds, configurable - after which the process is terminated.
