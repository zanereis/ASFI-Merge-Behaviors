write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nWhen the user edits a database, the password in the SQLAlchemy URI is masked (replaced with `XXXXXXXXXX`), so that the sensitive information is not transmitted down the wire unneedlessly. If the user saves the database edit, the mask is replaced with the original password, unless it has been changed.\r\n\r\nThe `encrypted_extra` field in a database may also contain sensitive fields. Instead of masking the whole field, in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21248 we introduced logic to mask only selected fields, so we can provide a better editing experience for users. For BigQuery, eg, the credentials look like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\r\n  \"project_id\": \"your project id\",\r\n  \"private_key_id\": \"your private key id\",\r\n  \"private_key\": \"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----...-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\n\",\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen editing, it will show in database modal as:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\r\n  \"project_id\": \"your project id\",\r\n  \"private_key_id\": \"your private key id\",\r\n  \"private_key\": \"XXXXXXXXXX\",\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe user can then selectively change some of the fields, and when the database is edited the `private_key` will be replaced with the old value if it's equal to `XXXXXXXXXX`.\r\n\r\nCurrently this functionality is only implemented for BigQuery and GSheets, but it should be implemented in all databases that store sensitive information under `encrypted_extra`. To simplify the process and remove duplicate code, in this PR I updated the methods in the base class to work with JSON paths. For BigQuery, for example, all that is needed now is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nencrypted_extra_sensitive_fields = [\"$.credentials_info.private_key\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds the logic for Snowflake.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nIn control panel for echart/BarChart there is a factory-function that supposed to build panels for x/y axises. Unfortunately `truncateXAxis` and `xAxisBounds` do not affected by axis name, therefore those options appears in both panels('X Axis', 'Y Axis'). They are complete duplicate and share the same state. Solution is to move those options from factory-function directly to `controlSetRows`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1800\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 11 35 38\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3006055-2d84-43d6-baa8-e21edde2f3dc\">\r\n<img width=\"1800\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-12 at 11 57 19\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc60f6f4-3cc1-450a-9844-2aab79056318\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe problem is available in the chart editor in the customization panel.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a feature that allows the Async Query Manager to use a configured cache backend through the new **GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES_CACHE_BACKEND** setting. To maintain backward compatibility, the existing **GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES_REDIS_CONFIG** setting is still supported but will be deprecated in the future. Additionally, this update _introduces support for Redis Sentinel caching_, which eliminates the single point of failure associated with the previous standalone Redis configuration.\r\n\r\nReferences taken from this Idea https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/28839\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\nConfigure **GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES_CACHE_BACKEND** in _config.py_ or _superset_config.py_ with the appropriate properties:\r\nSet CACHE_TYPE to \"RedisCache\" for Redis cache backend.\r\nSet CACHE_TYPE to \"RedisSentinelCache\" for Redis Sentinel cache backend.\r\nSet CACHE_TYPE to None to fall back on the previous GLOBAL_ASYNC_QUERIES_REDIS_CONFIG.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n-

SUMMARY\r\nFixes a error when downgrading revision `58d051681a3b`.  The previous code was invoking `downgrade_catalog_perms` after dropping the `catalog_perm` column which is used by that function, generating an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nop.drop_column(\"slices\", \"catalog_perm\")\r\nop.drop_column(\"tables\", \"catalog_perm\")\r\ndowngrade_catalog_perms(engines={\"postgresql\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR also rewrites revision `5f57af97bc3f` to remove duplicated code.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCheck both upgrade and downgrade operations for each migration.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-09T17:40:20Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:34:47Z","closed_at":"2024-08-09T18:11:55Z","merged_at":"2024-08-09T18:11:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"fb7f50868df99b9d42e611a7f1b7fb5a70d4eab0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127990345,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3OTkwMzQ1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/risk:db-migration","name":"risk:db-migration","color":"e67e22","default":false,"description":"PRs

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing up #27645, This commit includes the migration of the component used for SQLLab results from the ant-table component to the ag-grid component.\r\nDuring this process, the existing logic(`getWidthsForColumns`) that measured column size to adjust the width was removed because it was not only performance-intensive but also unnecessary, as the resizable column option in ag-grid allows users to adjust the width as needed.\r\nAdditionally, other property options were modified to ensure compatibility with ag-grid. Moreover, a column menu feature was added, enabling users to pin specific columns and apply filters.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2024-08-09

bundle analyzer in honor of @kgabryje's recent efforts. This PR does several things:\r\n\r\n- Adds a new `npm run bundle-stats` script to run package bundle analysis\r\n- Makes webpack's production build process (a.k.a. `npm run build`) exits when complete.\r\n- Removes the earlier `webpack-bundle-analyzer` flag in favor of the new npm script\r\n- Sets `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to `static` mode rather than `server` mode.\r\n- Adds a new bundle analyzer with a sunburst chart, which makes some aspects easier\r\n- Has BOTH bundle analyzers open at the end of the build process in your browser.\r\n\r\nHere's what the new bundle analyzer looks like:\r\n<img width=\"773\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84d1e68a-f898-4ae9-9d98-75d3c5cbb182\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR fixes the implementation of `upgrade_catalog_perms` and `downgrade_catalog_perms` methods to handle tables with millions of rows. To achieve this, I changed the algorithm to execute the migrations using a batched approach invoking the update/delete commands directly using a subquery instead of changing the records one by one. It also commits the transaction on every batch to avoid keeping a long standing transaction which leads to memory and timeout issues. Finally, I added detailed logging to help system administrators to track the migration progress and prepare for downtime.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/29801\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1 - Run any migration that uses the changed commands\r\n2 - Check that both upgrades and downgrades work\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2024-08-05T17:44:35Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T01:34:45Z","closed_at":"2024-08-16T12:39:37Z","merged_at":"2024-08-16T12:39:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"e8f5d7680ff14342b2ed46cc0b8c3bd4463fa3c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mistercrunch","id":487433,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NzQzMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/487433?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch","html_url":"https://github.com/mistercrunch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mistercrunch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":415794708,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MTU3OTQ3MDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/change:backend","name":"change:backend","color":"006b75","default":false,"description":"Requires

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nLoading slack channels earlier to ensure that the method dropdowns have the correct value when they are loaded. Instead of loading slack channels when the slack option is selected, I am now loading the options when the notification method is rendered. That way, we know if we need to use slack v1 or v2 by the time the notification method options are rendered (since we filter out one of the options, so that only one slack option displays)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nno visual changes\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nIf the feature flag is on, but the scopes are missing, a v1 (textarea input field) should display for slack. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nHandle edge cases when catalog is passed as `null` but the database supports catalog. This happens when \"Allow changing catalogs\" is disabled in the database. In these cases we need to use the default catalog, so that permissions checks work as expected.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n1. Add a database with catalogs (eg, Postgres)\r\n  - [X] Catalog permissions are created (eg, `[Postgres].[superset]`)\r\n  - [X] Schema permissions are created (eg, `[Postgres].[superset].[public]`)\r\n\r\n2. Create a user A with catalog-level permissions to the default catalog\r\n  - [X] User can see schemas in SQL Lab\r\n  - [X] User can choose schema in SQL Lab\r\n  - [X] User can choose table in SQL Lab\r\n  - [X] User can run queries\r\n  - [X] User can create a new dataset\r\n  - [X] User can see charts built from the dataset\r\n\r\n3. Create a user B with schema-level permissions to the default catalog\r\n  - [X] User can see only 1 schema in SQL Lab\r\n  - [X] User can choose table in SQL Lab\r\n  - [X] User can run queries\r\n  - [X] User can create a new dataset\r\n  - [X] User can see charts built from the dataset\r\n\r\n4. Create a user C with catalog-level permissions to a non-default catalog\r\n  - [X] User can't see schemas/tables in SQL Lab\r\n  - [X] User can't run queries in SQL Lab\r\n\r\n5. Create a user D with schema-level permissions to a non-default catalog\r\n  - [X] User can't see schemas/tables in SQL Lab\r\n  - [X] User can't run queries in SQL Lab\r\n\r\n6. Enable multi-catalog\r\n  - [X] Admin should see all catalogs\r\n  - [X] A, B, C, D should only see the catalogs they have access to\r\n  - [X] Repeat steps from (2)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThere was a bug where the slack recipients weren't getting updated correctly when they changed from v1 name to v2 ids during execution. This also adds slack channels to header logs so that if there is an error of channel_not_found for example, we can check the logs to see which channels were passed in. And lastly I found that the integration tests weren't loading user data, so I fixed that as well.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

href=\"https://github.com/alexreardon/memoize-one/releases\">memoize-one's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>5.2.1</h2>\n<p>The addition of a named import for <code>memoize-one</code> in <code>5.2.0</code> created an unintentional breaking change for our CommonJS bundle <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alexreardon/memoize-one/issues/116\">#116</a> (Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ehmicky\"><code>@​ehmicky</code></a> for finding this)</p>\n<p><code>5.2.1</code> reverts the addition of the named import of <code>5.2.0</code>. <code>5.2.0</code> has also been deprecated on <code>npm</code></p>\n<h2>5.2.0</h2>\n<h2>⚠️ <code>5.2.0</code> is deprecated on <code>npm</code> ⚠️</h2>\n<p>The addition of our named import created a breaking change for our CommonJS build <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alexreardon/memoize-one/issues/116\">#116</a> (Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/ehmicky\"><code>@​ehmicky</code></a> for finding this)</p>\n<p>The named import feature has been reverted and you can continue to use the default import has you always have</p>\n<pre lang=\"js\"><code>import memoizeOne from 'memoize-one';\n</code></pre>\n<h2>New feature: Added a named import <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/alexreardon/memoize-one/issues/37\">#37</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>DEPRECATED</strong> Please continue to use default import</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This resulted in a <code>minor</code> bump for the library</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You can now import <code>memoize-one</code> using a named import if you want</p>\n<pre lang=\"ts\"><code>import { memoizeOne } from 'memoize-one';\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, you can continue to use the default import</p>\n<pre lang=\"ts\"><code>import memoizeOne

checking function does a <code>===</code> equality check for all arguments. This was problematic when providing special &quot;not a number&quot; <code>number</code> → <code>NaN</code> as <code>NaN</code> !== <code>NaN</code>. Our default equality function now handles <code>NaN</code> values correctly</p>\n<p>Thank you <a href=\"https://github.com/ohoho7\"><code>@​ohoho7</code></a> for raising this and <a href=\"https://github.com/Ayub-Begimkulov\"><code>@​Ayub-Begimkulov</code></a> for diving it forward</p>\n<h2>Improvement: Documentation</h2>\n<p>I have added more detail to the readme which explains in greater detail how our default equality function works</p>\n<h2>Improvement: Bumping dev dependencies</h2>\n<p>I have upgraded all the <code>devDependencies</code> of <code>memoize-one</code> to be their latest versions.

href=\"https://github.com/pbeshai/use-query-params/releases\">use-query-params's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v2.2.1</h2>\n<h2>use-query-params v2.2.1 (March 24, 2023)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>fix: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pbeshai/use-query-params/issues/256\">#256</a> adds peer dependencies and metas to allow adapters to work on pnpm setups</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.2.0</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>fix: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pbeshai/use-query-params/issues/233\">#233</a> attempt to read location from data router in react-router 6.6+. making this a minor revision since it imports something that may not be there in older versions of react-router 6.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.1</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>fix: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pbeshai/use-query-params/issues/241\">#241</a> import from react-router-dom in adapters to prevent error about wrong context. (thank you <a href=\"https://github.com/lisandro52\"><code>@​lisandro52</code></a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.1.0</h2>\n<h2>use-query-params v2.1.0 (August 31, 2022)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>feat: <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pbeshai/use-query-params/issues/234\">#234</a> skip unnecessary updates by default. new option <code>skipUpdateWhenNoChange</code> defaults to true (set to false for previous behavior)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.0.1</h2>\n<h2>use-query-params v2.0.1 (August 31, 2022)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pbeshai/use-query-params/issues/233\">#233</a> - consecutive calls to setters (e.g. setFoo('a'); setBar('b')) properly accumulate. Previously only the last would make it through.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>v2.0.0</h2>\n<h2>use-query-params v2.0.0</h2>\n<p><strong>Breaking</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop dependency for query-string. New default uses URLSearchParams which doesn’t support <code>null</code>. You can continue using <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/query-string\">query-string</a> by specifying the <code>searchStringToObject</code> and <code>objectToSearchString</code> options as parse and stringify respectively.</li>\n<li>Modify <strong>QueryParamProvider</strong> to take adapter prop, no longer taking react router or reach props</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Deep imports for React-Router 5 and 6 adapters</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Supports registering params in the <strong>QueryParamProvider</strong> to have them available to any downstream hooks.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supports nesting <strong>QueryParamProviders</strong> to extend the registered params list</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Additional function signatures have been added, but greater care must be taken to get proper types out of the response.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>useQueryParam(’myparam’)</code> ← param type is inherited from the params registered in the <strong>QueryParamProvider</strong></li>\n<li><code>useQueryParam(’myparam’, StringParam, options)</code></li>\n<li><code>useQueryParams()</code> ← gets all params from the <strong>QueryParamProvider</strong></li>\n<li><code>useQueryParams([’myparam1’, ‘myparam2’])</code> ← gets just myparam1 and myparam2 from those registered in the <strong>QueryParamProvider</strong>.</li>\n<li><code>useQueryParams({ myparam: StringParam }, options)</code></li>\n<li><code>useQueryParams({ myparam: ‘inherit’ }, options)</code> ←inherit myparam param name from <strong>QueryParamProvider</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>New <code>options</code> prop to <strong>QueryParamProvider</strong> and argument to <strong>useQueryParam(s)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>(experimental) batching via <code>enableBatching</code> option (i.e., multiple consecutive calls to setQueryParams in a row only result in a single update to the URL). This seems to work but would require updating the way all the tests are written to verify for sure, so marking as experimental for now.</li>\n<li><code>removeDefaultsFromUrl</code> (default: false). This happens on updates only, not on initial load. Requires the use of the <code>default</code> attribute on a parameter to function (note serialize-query-params v2 withDefault now populates this).</li>\n<li><code>includeKnownParams</code> -  in addition to those specified, also include all preconfigured parameters from the <strong>QueryParamProvider</strong></li>\n<li><code>includeAllParams</code> (default: false) - in addition to those specified, include all other parameters found in the current URL</li>\n<li><code>updateType</code> (default “pushIn”) - the default update type when set is called.</li>\n<li><code>searchStringToObject, objectToSearchString</code> (default uses URLSearchParams) - equivalent of <code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code> from query-string.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Parameters now can include <code>urlName</code> to automatically convert to a different name in the URL (e.g. { encode, decode, urlName })</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Caches decoded values across multiple hook calls from different components</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

announce a new major version of mustache.js. We want to be very careful not to break projects out in the wild, and adhering to <a href=\"http://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning</a> we have therefore cut this new major version.</p>\n<p>The changes introduced will likely not require any actions for most using projects. The things to look out\nfor that might cause unexpected rendering results are described in the migration guide below.</p>\n<p>A big shout out and thanks to [<a href=\"https://github.com/raymond-lam\"><code>@​raymond-lam</code></a>] for this release! Without his contributions with code and\nissue triaging, this release would never have happened.</p>\n<h3>Major</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/janl/mustache.js/issues/618\">#618</a>: Allow rendering properties of primitive types that are not objects, by [<a href=\"https://github.com/raymond-lam\"><code>@​raymond-lam</code></a>].</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/janl/mustache.js/issues/643\">#643</a>: <code>Writer.prototype.parse</code> to cache by tags in addition to template string, by [<a href=\"https://github.com/raymond-lam\"><code>@​raymond-lam</code></a>].</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/janl/mustache.js/issues/664\">#664</a>: Fix <code>Writer.prototype.parse</code> cache, by [<a href=\"https://github.com/seminaoki\"><code>@​seminaoki</code></a>].</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

In short, that was unfortunate\nbecause there is more than caching happening in that method.</p>\n<p>We've improved that now by introducing a first class API that only affects template caching.</p>\n<p>The default template cache behaves as before and is still compatible with older JavaScript environments.\nFor those who wants to provide a custom more sopisiticated caching strategy, one can do that with an object that adheres to the following requirements:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nA few bugs related to catalogs and permissions:\r\n\r\n1. When a database is imported, catalog and schema permissions are not created. Ideally we should have the import functionality call the corresponding command (`CreateDatabaseCommand` in this case) to prevent duplicate logic (the import/export flow was created before the introduction of commands). For now this PR just adds the logic manually.\r\n2. When a database is updated, datasets and charts are not having their `catalog_perms` updated.\r\n3. Databricks has a weird behavior where `get_default_catalog() ⊈ get_catalog_names()`, so I fixed it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis fix addresses the issue mentioned in #29797. The datetime object passed into the cron scheduling function may not have a timezone associated with it. Therefore, when trying to convert the datetime to the specified timezone, it just adds timezone to the datetime. This is an issue because the function attempts to convert the datetime back into UTC, which causes an incorrect timezone conversion in this case. The fix is to add UTC to the timezone info for the datetime object before converting it to the specified timezone.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n`ace-builds` was 1 of the largest libraries in our bundle. It was always fetched when opening a dashboard even though it's only used in dashboard's edit mode (if there are markdown components), SQL lab, and SQL Editor popover in Explore.\r\nThis PR implements lazy loading that library.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNotice that we no longer fetch a 1.3MB chunk when opening a dashboard\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"837\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 16 36 23\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ffe5fdf-989d-4933-acde-5ceb8a96c5df\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"837\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 18 17 22\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e939703-77cc-4265-9d38-10ef949bb27f\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a dashboard\r\n2. Verify that the chunk containing ace-builds is not fetched initially\r\n3. Open edit mode and try to edit a markdown component - verify that it works fine\r\n4. Open SQL Lab - verify that SQL editor works fine\r\n5. Open a chart and metrics edit popover - verify that SQL editor works fine\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

is not a supported backend for Superset, so it is misleading to suggest it for a development environment.  The commit that named MariaDB here is quite old -- I traced it back to [a docs overall from 3 years ago](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17411), it is likely older than that (the PR was upgrading the docs system) but I stopped there.\r\n\r\nThere are two other things that could be addressed here:\r\n- Does, in fact, a DB need to be installed at this step?  I didn't see it referenced immediately.  If no, remove this whole sentence.  If yes, provide an example command.\r\n- Would Postgres be an acceptable alternative?  If so, say that.\r\n\r\nIf someone knows the answer please feel free to suggest the complete fix.

SUMMARY\r\nFollowing https://github.com/apache/superset/discussions/26096\r\n\r\nTo make the editor smart, this commit highlights actionable items (such as table names) among the tokens hovered over by the mouse. When cmd + click is pressed, additional data linked to the relevant metadata is displayed in a popup.\r\n\r\nThe first item implemented in this commit is table names. If the SQL content includes a table name with a schema (e.g., main.bart_lines) or if the text matches a table name from the list of tables in the currently selected schema, it is marked as actionable. When clicked, it displays table metadata (including columns) and a preview query in a popup, similar to the left panel.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nMany little improvements to the catalog migration helpers, especially on the downgrade.\r\n\r\n1. Works when the analytical DB is unreachable (fixed for schemas in #29549, this PR fixes catalogs)\r\n2. Delete catalog permissions on downgrade.\r\n3. Delete non-default catalog schema permissions on downgrade.\r\n4. Delete models on non-default catalog models.\r\n\r\nThe exception to (1) is that on `upgrade` we need to run `database.get_default_catalog()` in order to update models; doing this later would be messy and could lead to security issues. The `get_default_catalog()` method usually doesn't need to connect to the analytical database, except for Databricks (where it's always the need) and BigQuery (when the project is not specified in the SQLAlchemy URI).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!
