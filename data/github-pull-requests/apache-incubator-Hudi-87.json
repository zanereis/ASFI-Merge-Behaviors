What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHUDI DAG stages do not have any names. The Spark History Server UI shows these stages with the HUDI JAVA filename and the line number. \r\n\r\nThis change provides descriptive names for the stages which makes it easier to visualize the HUDI DAG.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n1. All code locations where JavaSparkContext.XXX (DAG creation methods like parallelize) are used have been updated with descriptive names for the job with the following API\r\n   jsc.setJobGroup(title, description);\r\n\r\n2. Title is the class name so its easy to identify. Description is the activity for that stage.\r\n\r\n3. Unit test code has been updates to enable the unit tests to write the Spark event logs so that even the unit tests can be visualized in a locally installed  Spark History Server UI.\r\n\r\n4. The unit tests need to be run as follows:\r\n\r\nmvn test -DSPARK_EVLOG_DIR=/path/for/spark/event/log\r\n\r\nOnce the unit tests complete, the Spark History Server shows the application logs for all completed unit tests. The unit tests themselves can be identified by the test-class-name as the application name.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n-- This pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n1. All existing unit tests pass.\r\n2. If the SPARK_EVLOG_DIR property is not set, spark event logging is not enabled (this is defauly behavior)\r\n3. Manually verified the change by running unit tests locally and observing the application logs on the locally installed Spark History Server.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.","created_at":"2020-01-29T00:37:47Z","updated_at":"2020-07-19T17:29:26Z","closed_at":"2020-07-19T17:29:26Z","merged_at":"2020-07-19T17:29:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"b71f25f210c4004a2dcc97a9967399e74f870fc7","assignee":{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"lamberken","id":20113411,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTEzNDEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20113411?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken","html_url":"https://github.com/lamberken","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lamberken/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"n3nash","id":2722167,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MjIxNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2722167?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash","html_url":"https://github.com/n3nash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/n3nash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"bvaradar","id":3021376,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMjEzNzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3021376?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar","html_url":"https://github.com/bvaradar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bvaradar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1289/commits

failure.\r\n\r\nAdd test cases to handle/verify stage failure scenarios.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n* Fix for HDFS \"LeaseRecoveryInProgress\" exception (triggered by an append failure) that results in stage failures and eventually job getting killed.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* Add a shutdown hook to handle JVM crash or executor getting killed, during write.\r\n* Upon encountering an append failure, close the file handle, so that subsequent task attempts on a different executor would be able to acquire lease on the .log file.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Added test cases to verify that upon stage failures, data records present in multiple log files can be successfully handled/merged.\r\n  \r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [x ] CI

Refactor common timeline methods to HoodieDefaultTimeline to reuse between Active and Archived timeline to make archived commits look similar to active commits\r\n- Modify tests to use archived timeline instead of reading files explicitly\r\n\r\nOther items planned (to be part of later diffs):\r\n- Modify all other commands to have 'archived' command. 'savepoints show archived' etc\r\n- There is no pagination/lazy loading support and if a really long time range is specified, this can result in OOM. To keep the diff small, I'm sending this one first. After I get feedback, i can send another diff to support lazy loading (or pagination). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as:\r\n  - TestHoodieCommitArchiveLog.java\r\n  - Manually verified the change by running CLI locally. Example output:\r\n`hoodie:$dataset->commits show archived\r\n\r\n

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses [HUDI-552](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-552).  When using the `FilebasedSchemaProvider` to provide the source/target schema in Avro, while ingesting data with the same columns from `RowSource`, the DeltaStreamer failed.  The root cause is that when writing parquet files in Spark, all fields are automatically converted to be nullable for compatibility reasons.  If the source Avro schema has non-null fields, `AvroConversionUtils.createRdd` still uses the schema from the Dataframe to convert the Row to Avro record, resulting in a different schema (only nullability difference).\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue, the Avro schema, if exists, is passed to the conversion function to reconstruct the correct StructType for conversion.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Passed the Avro schema to `createRdd` to generate the correct StructType for conversion in `DeltaSync.readFromSource` and `AvroConversionUtils.createRdd`\r\n  - Added new tests to make sure the logic is correct (before this schema fix some of the new tests failed)\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added tests in `TestHoodieDeltaStreamer` to test the `HoodieDeltaStreamer` with `ParquetDFSSource` under different configurations\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title &

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n`TestDFSSource` class contains redundant code of the test logic for different `Source`s reading from DFS.  This PR abstracts a test case class for DFS Source to make it extensible.  It can be easily extended to run test for new DFS `Source`, such as `CsvDFSSource` to come in HUDI-76.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Refactored the code in `TestDFSSource` to add a new abstract class `AbstractDFSSourceTestBase ` to make the test of different DFS `Source` extensible.\r\n  - Created separate new test classes, `TestJsonDFSSource ` for `JsonDFSSource` and `TestParquetDFSSource` for `ParquetDFSSource`.\r\n  - Deleted `TestDFSSource` class.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a code refactoring of the DFS Source tests, and the

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nHudi project has code coverage enabled via the jacoco plugin. Jenkins has better support for coverage reporting using the Jenkins Cobertura plugin. \r\n\r\nThis enhancement provides a way to convert the jacoco coverage report to cobertura format at the end of the unit test runs. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n1. Fixed the jacoco coverage settings\r\n   - the jacoco agent was not being loaded as the SureFire plugins argLine was not set correctly\r\n2. The jacoco coverage report is converted to cobertura report format after test completion using the gradle jacobo plugin.\r\n3. There is a specific gradle job defined for the conversion. Modules which do not run tests use a \"noop\" job.\r\n4. When tests are skipped (-DskipTests) the gradle job is set to noop to prevent the conversion.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\nIt has been tested to generate the coverage reports after a maven test.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nPR #1009 introduces table layout version which is used to determine if rename must be allowed or not. Renames are disabled by default in 0.5.1 but users can enable them in ingestion through write config. Along with this feature, another related change to avoid writing compaction plans in .aux folder is added. This change could result in race conditions when we use different versions for reader and writer.

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request adds quick-start document.)*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nMost ideas of this PR is pretty similar to https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1109. \r\n\r\nThis PR is also compatible with Scala 2.12. You can build it with: \r\n```mvn clean install -Dscala.version=2.12.10 -Dscala.binary.version=2.12```\r\n\r\nHere are some major differences between https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/pull/1109:\r\n- This PR does not change Scala version in pom.xml, so by default, the Scala version is still 2.11. But you can build Scala 2.12 through setting parameters.\r\n- updated kafka-source.properties & kafka-source.properties .\r\n- This parameter: ```ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG``` is defined in ```TestKafkaSource.java``` rather than in ```KafkaOffsetGen.java```. Because this config should be decided by the client side but not the Hudi side.\r\n-  For ```AvroKafkaSource.java ```, ```KafkaAvroDeserializer.class``` need to be set.\r\n```\r\n    props.put(\"key.deserializer\", StringDeserializer.class);\r\n    props.put(\"value.deserializer\", KafkaAvroDeserializer.class);\r\n```\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\nTest with Scala 2.12 (I skipped integ testing because it doesn't make sense without changing docker images): \r\n```mvn clean install -Dscala.version=2.12.10 -Dscala.binary.version=2.12 -DskipITs```\r\n```\r\n[INFO] Reactor Summary for Hudi 0.5.1-SNAPSHOT:\r\n[INFO] \r\n[INFO] Hudi ...............................................

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nWith migration of Hudi to `spark 2.4.4` and to using `native spark-avro`, there is an issue with conversion of struct fields because of the way spark-avro handles avro schema conversion vs databricks-avro. This has been reported earlier for EMR in https://github.com/apache/incubator-hudi/issues/1034 and now exists in Hudi master as well.\r\n\r\nThe issue is `spark-avro` has a different way of naming `Avro namespace` than `databricks-avro`, while converting the schema to avro schema. For example suppose the data is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList(\"{ \\\"deviceId\\\": \\\"aaaaa\\\", \\\"eventType\\\": \\\"uditevent1\\\", \\\"eventTimeMilli\\\": 1574297893836, \\\"location\\\": { \\\"latitude\\\": 2.5, \\\"longitude\\\": 3.5 }}\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n`databricks-avro` used to convert it to avro schema, such that namespace of `location` struct field has field name in it:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n  \"name\" : \"hudi_issue_1034_dec30_01_record\",\r\n  \"namespace\" : \"hoodie.hudi_issue_1034_dec30_01\",\r\n  \"fields\" : [ {\r\n    \"name\" : \"deviceId\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"string\", \"null\" ]\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"eventTimeMilli\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"long\", \"null\" ]\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"location\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ {\r\n      \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n      \"name\" : \"location\",\r\n      \"namespace\" : \"hoodie.hudi_issue_1034_dec30_01.location\",\r\n      \"fields\" : [ {\r\n        \"name\" : \"latitude\",\r\n        \"type\" : [ \"double\", \"null\" ]\r\n      }, {\r\n        \"name\" : \"longitude\",\r\n        \"type\" : [ \"double\", \"null\" ]\r\n      } ]\r\n    }, \"null\" ]\r\n  } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n`spark-avro` now converts the same to the following, and uses the `record name` in the schema instead:\r\n```\r\n{        \r\n  \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n  \"name\" : \"hudi_issue_1034_dec31_01_record\",\r\n  \"namespace\" : \"hoodie.hudi_issue_1034_dec31_01\",\r\n  \"fields\" : [ {\r\n    \"name\" : \"deviceId\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"string\", \"null\" ]\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"eventTimeMilli\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ \"long\", \"null\" ]\r\n  }, {\r\n    \"name\" : \"location\",\r\n    \"type\" : [ {\r\n      \"type\" : \"record\",\r\n      \"name\" : \"location\",\r\n      \"namespace\" : \"hoodie.hudi_issue_1034_dec31_01.hudi_issue_1034_dec31_01_record\",\r\n      \"fields\" : [ {\r\n        \"name\" : \"latitude\",\r\n        \"type\" : [ \"double\", \"null\" ]\r\n      }, {\r\n        \"name\" : \"longitude\",\r\n        \"type\" : [ \"double\", \"null\" ]\r\n      } ]\r\n    }, \"null\" ]\r\n  } ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the above issue as we have now migrated to spark-avro.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Fix conversion of Spark struct type to Avro schema\r\n- Modify the schema of data used in unit tests and integration tests to have struct type data as well, so that any issue with struct type can be caught earlier\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the schema of the data that is being used across unit tests and certain integration tests to have a struct field. From now on Unit/Integration tests would catch any issue with struct fields.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn our production environment, we usually need to synchronize data from mysql, and at the same time, we need to get the schema from the database. So I submitted this PR. A schema provider that obtains metadata through Jdbc calls the Spark JDBC related methods by design. And ensure the uniformity of the schema, such as reading historical data from spark jdbc, and Use delta streamer to synchronize data.\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-09T08:11:49Z","updated_at":"2020-02-14T02:06:32Z","closed_at":"2020-02-14T02:06:07Z","merged_at":"2020-02-14T02:06:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"dfbee673ef63c7305e131d5dfa17b304b128917f","assignee":{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"vinothchandar","id":1179324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNzkzMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1179324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar","html_url":"https://github.com/vinothchandar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vinothchandar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/1200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/1200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/ca14ac95db69fc7701e0453df01119d42204f509","head":{"label":"OpenOpened:jdbc-provider","ref":"jdbc-provider","sha":"ca14ac95db69fc7701e0453df01119d42204f509","user":{"login":"OpenOpened","id":23738217,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzNzM4MjE3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23738217?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened","html_url":"https://github.com/OpenOpened","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/OpenOpened/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d26dc0b229043afa5aefca239e72f40d80446917","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76474200,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NjQ3NDIwMA==","name":"hudi","full_name":"apache/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"log
