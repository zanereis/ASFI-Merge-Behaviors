The RBAC permission will only be reset in the very beginning and later when init_role is called, it will keep the existing permission as is and will not reset it. Previously, when any change is made to the RBAC permissions, those changes used to get reset when init_roles is called (for every new process creation). Because of which, any new RBAC permission added via UI used to be missing in the database after sometime. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n        test_update_and_verify_permission_role\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3277\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n`following_schedule` converts to naive time by using the\r\nlocal time zone. In case of a DST transition, say 3AM -> 2AM\r\n(\"summer time to winter time\") we generate date times that\r\ncould overlap with earlier schedules. Therefore a DAG that\r\nshould run every 5 minutes will not do so if it has already\r\nseen the schedule.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nadded\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [X] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [X] Passes `flake8`\r\n\r\ncc @ashb

is caused by the fact that the function 'sort' is no longer a part of Dataframe in pandas and is still used in the code base. It has ever since been replaced by 'sort_values'. Replacing the function gets the chart display back to its normal behavior.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3259/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3259\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3259\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nWhen you try to create a chart and display metrics you get an internal server error.\r\n\r\n**Cause**\r\nA dependency issue: the function \"sort\" was deprecated and is no longer a part of pandas Dataframe and thus it creates a problem when creating charts in airflow.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nThe sort function needs to replaced by sort_values instead (See code below)\r\n`# Replace this `\r\n`df = df.sort(df.columns[0]) `\r\n`# By this `\r\n`df = df.sort_values(by=df.columns[0])`\r\nIn views.py\r\n\r\n**Result**\r\nThe data is loaded and the chart displayed   \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nMy code doesn't change the behavior of the code, but rather modifies a no longer existing function (in pandas) with its new substitute.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commit all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-29T14:09:41Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T21:58:22Z","closed_at":"2018-11-07T21:58:16Z","merged_at":"2018-11-07T21:58:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"feab6a7f18c649b49a6c7a5b355ed76b1a344cde","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4114/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4114/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4114/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/26297aa33806f775253b0341ba37dc6591660c89","head":{"label":"elmesaoudee:AIRFLOW_3259_resolve_dependency_issue","ref":"AIRFLOW_3259_resolve_dependency_issue","sha":"26297aa33806f775253b0341ba37dc6591660c89","user":{"login":"elmesaoudee","id":18504843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTA0ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18504843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee","html_url":"https://github.com/elmesaoudee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154682665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQ2ODI2NjU=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"elmesaoudee/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"elmesaoudee","id":18504843,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NTA0ODQz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18504843?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee","html_url":"https://github.com/elmesaoudee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/elmesaoudee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/elmesaoudee/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3268\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nIt is impossible to pass 'ssl' dictionary to MySql hook as an extrai\r\nparam via URL connection. While there is a code to pass the 'ssl'\r\nextra query parameter, MySqldb requires this parameter to be\r\ndictionary. When you want to create a connection via URL,\r\nyou can at most have ?ssl= url-encoded string rather than\r\ndictionary and this is how it is passed (as string). What happens\r\nthen in MySqldb, is that all SSL parameters are ignored\r\nand MySQL establishes a non-SSL connection silently.\r\n\r\nThis is fixed by detecting if 'ssl' is a string and converting\r\nit to json dictionary in such case.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests\r\nTestMySqlHookConn:\r\n   test_get_conn_ssl_as_dictionary\r\n   test_get_conn_ssl_as_string\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\nNo new functionality\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-29T14:01:49Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T16:03:09Z","closed_at":"2018-11-05T16:22:18Z","merged_at":"2018-11-05T16:22:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"b5ecb8a78b4e2455eede44a58dddb544e6ade387","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d856af3184be0054fe77bc9e4e8e6d3519dbbe4f","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:AIRFLOW-3268-pass-ssl-as-dictionary-mysql","ref":"AIRFLOW-3268-pass-ssl-as-dictionary-mysql","sha":"d856af3184be0054fe77bc9e4e8e6d3519dbbe4f","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3212\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:  My PR adds AwsGlueCatalogPartitionSensor and AwsGlueCatalogHook with supporting functions. The purpose of these are to be able to provide a partition sensor based on AWS Glue Catalog using AWS APIs (via boto), thus eliminating the need to spin up infrastructure (e.g. AWS EMR cluster) first.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: test_aws_glue_catalog_partition_sensor and test_aws_glue_catalog_hook\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-28T23:47:36Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T20:08:42Z","closed_at":"2019-01-11T19:35:08Z","merged_at":"2019-01-11T19:35:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"71dd6017e78ca93b81069b3c83f4982ca4c6413b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4112/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4112/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4112/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d87158f28cb95c4c3cce3a378bd7e50ba7af3bcd","head":{"label":"mikemole:glue-partition-sensor-AIRFLOW-3212","ref":"glue-partition-sensor-AIRFLOW-3212","sha":"d87158f28cb95c4c3cce3a378bd7e50ba7af3bcd","user":{"login":"mikemole","id":2301575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDE1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2301575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":153476178,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTM0NzYxNzg=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"mikemole/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mikemole","id":2301575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDE1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2301575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole","html_url":"https://github.com/mikemole","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mikemole/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mikemole/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3264\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nFull URL decoding is performed now when parsing different\r\ncomponents of URI for connection. This enables to configure\r\npaths to sockets including (for example \":\") - so far\r\nonly '/' (%2f) was hard-coded in hostname. This change introduces\r\nfull decoding for all components of the URI.\r\n\r\nNote that this is potentially breaking change if someone uses\r\n% in some of their AIRFLOW_CONN_ defined connections.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests :\r\ntests.models.ConnectionTest:\r\n  - test_connection_from_uri_with_colon_in_hostname\r\n  - test_connection_from_uri_with_encoded_password\r\n  - test_connection_from_uri_with_encoded_user\r\n  - test_connection_from_uri_with_encoded_schema\r\n  - test_connection_from_uri_with_no_schema\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

references them in the PR title.\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3263\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nSometimes when you run tasks from command line you get exit code = 1 due\r\nto race condition (job runner tries to get process group from the\r\nprocess that has already been terminated in the meantime)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR  does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nIt's rather difficult to simulate such race. It's not really worth It to build test for it with such simple change. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\nChanged 2 lines in CONTRIBUTING.md.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nChanged 2 lines in CONTRIBUTING.md:\r\n\r\n1. Set Python version to 3 in instructions about using Docker for unit testing. The Python world prefers version 3 afaik, so let's promote that version. There's still a note saying both Python 2 & 3 are supported.\r\n2. Removed incorrect `cd` statement (`pip install` must be run from `/airflow` and the `docker run` sets the working dir to `/airflow`, so it's incorrect to then go to `/airflow/airflow` inside the container).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo tests for docs.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3262\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWhen you use SimpleHttpOperator for things like ElasticSearch, you want to get the response in the logs as well. Currently, the only workaround is to use `xcom_push` and push the content to xcom and in the next task get the response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n- `SimpleHttpOpTests.test_response_in_logs`: Test that when using SimpleHttpOperator with 'GET' on localhost:8080, the log contains 'Airflow' in it\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-26T21:59:30Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T23:18:51Z","closed_at":"2018-11-02T13:33:10Z","merged_at":"2018-11-02T13:33:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"38b54a0d78ac4092a62f3f9e989bd9809d08d6d3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4102/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4102/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4102/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/eb44d6b12b80b671eac5c66100c911ae0145a9ae","head":{"label":"kaxil:AIRFLOW-3262","ref":"AIRFLOW-3262","sha":"eb44d6b12b80b671eac5c66100c911ae0145a9ae","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3231) issue and references it in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd CloudSqlInstanceInsertOperator, CloudSqlInstancePatchOperator and CloudSqlInstanceDeleteOperator.\r\n\r\nEach operator includes:\r\n- core logic\r\n- input params validation\r\n- unit tests\r\n- presence in the example DAG\r\n- docstrings\r\n- How-to and Integration documentation\r\n\r\nAdditionally, small improvements to GcpBodyFieldValidator were made:\r\n- add simple list validation capability (type=\"list\")\r\n- introduced parameter allow_empty, which can be set to False\r\n\tto test for non-emptiness of a string instead of specifying\r\n\ta regexp.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n`test_gcp_sql_operator.py`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: sprzedwojski

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-25T21:47:05Z","updated_at":"2018-10-26T18:42:57Z","closed_at":"2018-10-26T08:41:45Z","merged_at":"2018-10-26T08:41:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"a1e922fe6d7ac3aa19848a1ad34836b61fccf24d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4095/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4095/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4095/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/b954c0d45accf026e1c4cd8f935d096d0aa35a1d","head":{"label":"iamthebot:al--fix_docker_status","ref":"al--fix_docker_status","sha":"b954c0d45accf026e1c4cd8f935d096d0aa35a1d","user":{"login":"iamthebot","id":8432571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzI1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8432571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot","html_url":"https://github.com/iamthebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154741103,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQ3NDExMDM=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"iamthebot/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"iamthebot","id":8432571,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MzI1NzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8432571?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot","html_url":"https://github.com/iamthebot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamthebot/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/iamthebot/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3236\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- Adds a new operator called AzureDataLakeStorageListOperator that returns a list of files at some given path. Operates in much the same way as the list operators for GCS and S3. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\ntest_execute\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-25T18:22:47Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T23:08:53Z","closed_at":"2018-10-31T23:08:53Z","merged_at":"2018-10-31T23:08:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"66cad8d6a0d98b026fb5c27c1f5c60e56cd7b111","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5f62980c1451f85fdaba636006e0b60b612291eb","head":{"label":"bkvarda:azurelistoperator","ref":"azurelistoperator","sha":"5f62980c1451f85fdaba636006e0b60b612291eb","user":{"login":"bkvarda","id":6834678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzQ2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6834678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda","html_url":"https://github.com/bkvarda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":153686285,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTM2ODYyODU=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"bkvarda/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bkvarda","id":6834678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzQ2Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6834678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda","html_url":"https://github.com/bkvarda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bkvarda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bkvarda/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

##\r\n**Problem**\r\nWhen you try to create a chart and display metrics you get an internal server error.\r\n\r\n**Cause**\r\nA dependency issue: the function \"sort\" was deprecated and is no longer a part of pandas Dataframe and thus it creates a problem when creating charts in airflow.\r\n\r\n**Solution**\r\nThe sort function needs to replaced by sort_values instead (See code below)\r\n`# Replace this `\r\n`df = df.sort(df.columns[0]) `\r\n`# By this `\r\n`df = df.sort_values(by=df.columns[0])`\r\nIn views.py\r\n\r\n**Result**\r\nThe data is loaded and the chart displayed   \r\n\r\n## Tests ##\r\nMy PR does not need testing for the simple reason:\r\nMy code doesn't change the behavior of the code, but rather modifies a no longer existing function (in pandas) with its new substitute.\r\n\r\n## Code quality ##\r\n  Passes

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3257) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR:\r\n\r\nFlake8 3.6.0 was just released and it introduced some new checks that\r\ndidn't exist before. As a result all of our CI pipelines are now failing.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this happening in future we should pin the version of flake8\r\nto 3.5.0 (currently this is in tox.ini, and setup.py)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nNo new tests, PR only pins a dependency.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\nNo new functionality.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2524\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n1. Update SageMaker Training, Tuning and Transform Operators. Renaming previous operator names and add a base operator.\r\n2. Update SageMaker Hook. Introduce more APIs.\r\n3. Update related unit tests.\r\n4. Add class in docs/code.rst for documentation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n1. Unit tests for SageMakerHook\r\n2. Unit tests for SageMaker Base/Training/Tuning/Transform Operators\r\n3. Unit tests for SageMaker Base/Training/Tuning/Transform Sensors\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-25T08:21:17Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T22:37:04Z","closed_at":"2018-11-01T20:31:59Z","merged_at":"2018-11-01T20:31:59Z","merge_commit_sha":"bc3108edc1f63208be1d3bf8893c22bb12c7bc9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4091/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4091/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4091/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/438aa8a6db2f16ead76725d298869820e705b4f4","head":{"label":"yangaws:pr-1","ref":"pr-1","sha":"438aa8a6db2f16ead76725d298869820e705b4f4","user":{"login":"yangaws","id":31293788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjkzNzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31293788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws","html_url":"https://github.com/yangaws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":136527929,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzY1Mjc5Mjk=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"yangaws/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yangaws","id":31293788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjkzNzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31293788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws","html_url":"https://github.com/yangaws","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangaws/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yangaws/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

This adds support for multipart uploads (uploading a single file, with the actual transport split into multiple HTTP requests), and retries (using the retry functionality from the `google-api-python-client` library).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTests for upload behavior (both multipart and single part) have been added to `tests.contrib.hooks.test_gcs_hook`.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

change allows Airflow to reattach to existing Dataproc jobs upon scheduler restart. Previously, if the Airflow scheduler restarts while it's running a job on GCP Dataproc, it'll lose track of that job, mark the task as failed, and eventually retry. However, the jobs may still be running on Dataproc and maybe even finish successfully. So when Airflow retries and reruns the job, the same job will run twice. This can result in issues like delayed workflows, increased costs, and duplicate data.\r\n\r\nThe fix also helps in cases where the task fails for some other reason: for example, sometimes the Dataproc service is unavailable, and the Airflow task will fail because it can't check the status of the job, but the job is actually still running correctly.\r\n\r\nWe've been using this solution successfully at Etsy for the past 6 months. \r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3211\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nMy change has Airflow query the Dataproc API before submitting a job to see if the job is already running on the cluster. If a job with a matching task ID is already running on the cluster AND is in a recoverable state (like RUNNING or DONE), then Airflow will reattach itself to the existing job on Dataproc instead of resubmitting a new job to the cluster. If the job on the cluster is in an irrecoverable state like ERROR, Airflow will resubmit the job.\r\n\r\nTo see this change in action:\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n1. Set up a GCP Project with the Dataproc API enabled\r\n2. Install Airflow.\r\n3. In the box that's running Airflow, `pip install google-api-python-client oauth2client`\r\n4. Start the Airflow webserver. In the Airflow UI, Go to Admin->Connections, edit the `google_cloud_default` connection, and fill in the Project Id field with your project ID.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Install this DAG in the Airflow instance: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/python-docs-samples/blob/b80895ed88ba86fce223df27a48bf481007ca708/composer/workflows/quickstart.py Set up the Airflow variables as instructed at the top of the file.\r\n2. Start the Airflow scheduler and webserver if they're not running already. Kick off a run of the above DAG through the Airflow UI. Wait for the cluster to spin up and the job to start running on Dataproc.\r\n3. While the job's running, kill the scheduler. Wait 5 seconds or so, and then start it back up.\r\n4. Airflow will retry the task and reattach to the existing task already on Dataproc. Look at the Airflow logs to observe \"Reattaching to previously-started DataProc job run_dataproc_... (in state RUNNING).\" Click on the cluster in Dataproc to observe that only the single job is running; a duplicate job has not been submitted.\r\n5. Observe that, when the job finishes, Airflow detects the completion successfully and runs the downstream cluster delete operation.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded the following tests to `tests/contrib/hooks/test_gcp_dataproc_hook.py`:\r\n\r\nWhen submitting a new job to Dataproc:\r\n- If a job with the same task ID is already running on the cluster, don't resubmit the job.\r\n- If the first matching job found on the cluster is in an irrecoverable state, keep looking for a job in a recoverable state to reattach to on the cluster. This ensures that Airflow will prioritize recoverable jobs when looking for jobs to reattach to on the cluster.\r\n- If there are jobs running on the cluster, but none of them have the same task ID as the job we're about to submit, then submit the new job.\r\n- If there are no other jobs already running on the cluster, then submit the job.\r\n- If a job with the same task ID finished with error on the cluster, then resubmit the job for retry.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-23T00:24:15Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T11:59:26Z","closed_at":"2019-06-14T11:59:26Z","merged_at":"2019-06-14T11:59:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"3b29290ecc036ee219138be157eaee01312cd1a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/73bd599e20d180a7933a0762fc089e84212f092f","head":{"label":"jj-ian:AIRFLOW-3211","ref":"AIRFLOW-3211","sha":"73bd599e20d180a7933a0762fc089e84212f092f","user":{"login":"jj-ian","id":7432854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzI4NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7432854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian","html_url":"https://github.com/jj-ian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154227841,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQyMjc4NDE=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"jj-ian/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jj-ian","id":7432854,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzI4NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7432854?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian","html_url":"https://github.com/jj-ian","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jj-ian/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jj-ian/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

race condition bites us rather often in our success callbacks, hoping to get this included in an upcoming release.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2865/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nIn cases where the success callback takes variable\r\ntime, it's possible for it to interrupted by the heartbeat process.\r\nThis is because the heartbeat process looks for tasks that are no\r\nlonger in the \"running\" state but are still executing and reaps them.\r\n\r\nThis commit reverses the order of callback invocation and state\r\nupdating so that the \"SUCCESS\" state for the task isn't committed\r\nto the database until after the success callback has finished.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nTaskInstanceTest.test_success_callbak_no_race_condition\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-22T20:51:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T17:32:06Z","closed_at":"2018-11-05T17:24:55Z","merged_at":"2018-11-05T17:24:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"62942086e5a4c7d93a8a38d7e826db76532afdd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4082/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4082/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4082/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/8a4199885fe681c6450300fb593ca9e340040f00","head":{"label":"evizitei:success-race-condition","ref":"success-race-condition","sha":"8a4199885fe681c6450300fb593ca9e340040f00","user":{"login":"evizitei","id":9743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei","html_url":"https://github.com/evizitei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":154203432,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTQyMDM0MzI=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"evizitei/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"evizitei","id":9743,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9743?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei","html_url":"https://github.com/evizitei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/evizitei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/evizitei/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-520\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8811558/47261096-53d3d100-d4c0-11e8-94dc-8d9ba4ce2647.png)\r\n\r\nThat is because of the following issue:\r\n```\r\n>>> import pkg_resources\r\n>>> airflow_version = pkg_resources.require(\"apache-airflow\")[0].version\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/Users/kaxil/.virtualenvs/airflow_stable_pip/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 892, in require\r\n    needed = self.resolve(parse_requirements(requirements))\r\n  File \"/Users/kaxil/.virtualenvs/airflow_stable_pip/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pkg_resources/__init__.py\", line 783, in resolve\r\n    raise VersionConflict(dist, req).with_context(dependent_req)\r\npkg_resources.ContextualVersionConflict: (Flask-Login 0.2.11 (/Users/kaxil/.virtualenvs/airflow_stable_pip/lib/python2.7/site-packages), Requirement.parse('Flask-Login<0.5,>=0.3'), set(['flask-appbuilder']))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also brings it in line with RBAC FAB UI.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-20T22:30:43Z","updated_at":"2019-01-08T23:18:55Z","closed_at":"2018-10-23T09:24:19Z","merged_at":"2018-10-23T09:24:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"7df4405aa5a0c99e51722321caa7af660d35794b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"Fokko","id":1134248,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQyNDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134248?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko","html_url":"https://github.com/Fokko","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Fokko/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4072/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4072/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4072/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/4b178422351c808d21ae74b5e8fc6cf6d32e49e4","head":{"label":"kaxil:ui-version","ref":"ui-version","sha":"4b178422351c808d21ae74b5e8fc6cf6d32e49e4","user":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":112322392,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTIzMjIzOTI=","name":"airflow","full_name":"kaxil/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil/airflow","description":"Apache

Therefore, refactor the example DAGs, which mostly involves:\r\n\r\n- Replace set_upstream() and set_downstream() by the bitshift operators, since they exist since Airflow 1.8 and everybody uses those now.\r\n- Optimise imports (grouping by stdlib/3rd party/own and alphabetic ordering).\r\n- Place function calls with arguments on single line if line is short enough, or put each function argument on a new line, but don't mix.\r\n- Passing list of tasks when setting dependencies instead of making multiple set_up/down-stream calls.\r\n- Switch upstream dependencies into downstream dependencies since these are more logical to read IMO.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nOnly refactored some code, all existing tests should pass.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nCurrently deleting DAGs that exist on the scheduler but not the webserver is not possible because the DAG id in the deletion URL comes from the webserver DAG object.\r\ne.g. http://localhost:8080/delete?dag_id= instead of http://localhost:8080/delete?dag_id=example_kubernetes_executor\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nUI Fix, tested both RBAC and regular.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1.

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `pin-large.png` logo contains a small spot which looks like a blemish, and not a purposeful spot. I see people all over the internet copy this picture and see the spot everywhere. E.g. the GCP Composer documentation:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/47105687-ebc58680-d244-11e8-8c21-9364865dae75.png)\r\n\r\nSeems like a mistake, so I removed the spot from the `pin-large.png`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6249654/47105946-ac4b6a00-d245-11e8-818a-253da6ef3bf8.png)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI don't test pictures.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2799\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Our conversion to Timezone-aware date times in 1.10 missed this case -\r\nany filter on a date time would blow up with `naive datetime is\r\ndisallowed` - this makes our datetime filters timezone aware now (they\r\nrespect the default_timezone, and they accept timezones in input even\r\nthough the UI won't let you craft those.)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] added a simple test to www.test_views and www_rbac.test_views\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new

For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-3207\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3207\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-3207\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nBaseOperator should have an option to stop a task pushing the return value of execute() to xcom.\r\nthe default should be to push (preserves backward compat)\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntest_save_result_to_xcom() tests the flag in false. previous tests already test the auto/true option\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes

ened with us the output from\r\noperators/tasks when running `airflow test` not going anywhere (because\r\nwe have call `ti.init_run_context()` the FileTaskHandler doens't have a\r\nfilename, so logs don't go anywhere)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: added tests to test_cli that validates the output is actually printed.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `flake8`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-14T14:43:54Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T14:52:50Z","closed_at":"2018-10-14T16:24:46Z","merged_at":"2018-10-14T16:24:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"57acfbc40a8960513753f1216c9ebed24a93af90","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7840429bb53b75a661d1aba486fe302da40ce82d","head":{"label":"ashb:output-from-testcmd-console","ref":"output-from-testcmd-console","sha":"7840429bb53b75a661d1aba486fe302da40ce82d","user":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":94879701,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NDg3OTcwMQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"ashb/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ashb/airflow","description":"Apache

tasks via sudo then AIRFLOW__ config env vars won't be\r\nvisible anymore (without them showing up in `ps`) and we likely might\r\nnot have permission to run the _cmd's specified to find the passwords.\r\n\r\nBut if we are running as the same user then there is no need to \"bake\"\r\nthose options in to the temporary config file -- if the operator decided\r\nthey didn't want those values appearing in a config file on disk, then\r\nlets do our best to respect that.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests: added some tests to tests/configuration.py.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-14T13:40:33Z","updated_at":"2019-05-19T12:10:46Z","closed_at":"2019-05-07T20:17:20Z","merged_at":"2019-05-07T20:17:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"670f2ed52974038d4ee693674d3c18c015030b5f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4050/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4050/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4050/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/9918541beb554189eb49b64fc9f3b9d11905a76b","head":{"label":"apache:dont-bake-env-into-tmp-config","ref":"dont-bake-env-into-tmp-config","sha":"9918541beb554189eb49b64fc9f3b9d11905a76b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

used by default if no tag provided. This is handled by `docker` package itself.\r\n\r\n- Intermediate variable `cpu_shares` is not needed.\r\n\r\n- Fix out-dated usage of `cpu_shares` and `cpu_shares`.\r\n  Based on https://docker-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#docker.api.container.ContainerApiMixin.create_host_config,\r\n  They should be an arguments of `self.cli.create_host_config()` rather than `APIClient.create_container()`.\r\n\r\n- Change name of the corresponding test script, to ensure it can be discovered.\r\n\r\n- Fix the test itself.\r\n\r\n- This PR also fixed part of the test scripts of Operators.

JIRA\r\n  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3174\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n- These SQL operators (based on `DbApiHook`) receive `sql` and `parameters` (optional) as arguments. But `parameters` were not documented. The contents I added is based on the docstring in https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/blob/master/airflow/hooks/dbapi_hook.py#L88\r\n\r\n- Fixed two minor style errors which would cause incorrect documentation rendering\r\n\r\n- Added docstring for `autocommit` parameter in relevant operators. The content is based on https://db.apache.org/derby/docs/10.9/devguide/cdevconcepts29416.html and https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/ecpg-commands.html\r\n\r\n- Adjusted order or docstring items to make sure they are consistent with the order of arguments.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-12T15:37:05Z","updated_at":"2018-10-13T06:11:46Z","closed_at":"2018-10-13T06:09:31Z","merged_at":"2018-10-13T06:09:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"90e6fa1ac57bf651ff479c317ec5b649073fb588","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4043/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4043/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4043/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/441633411fd4ef1b76227f9e6fedc59a6c53f6a9","head":{"label":"XD-DENG:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"441633411fd4ef1b76227f9e6fedc59a6c53f6a9","user":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142260154,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIyNjAxNTQ=","name":"airflow","full_name":"XD-DENG/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG/airflow","description":"Apache

#3938 \r\n\r\nMake sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3046) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3046\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nWe have ECS clusters made up of EC2 spot fleets. Among other things, this means hosts can be terminated on short notice. When this happens, all tasks (and associated containers) get terminated, as well.\r\n\r\nWe expect that when that happens for Airflow task instances using the ECS Operator, those instances will be marked as failures and retried.\r\n\r\nInstead, they are marked as successful.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the immediate downstream task fails, causing the scheduled DAG run to fail.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the Airflow log output when this happens:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2018-09-12 01:02:02,712] {ecs_operator.py:112} INFO - ECS Task stopped, check status: {'tasks': [{'taskArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:task/32d43a1d-fbc7-4659-815d-9133bde11cdc', 'clusterArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:cluster/processing', 'taskDefinitionArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:task-definition/foobar-testing_dataEngineering_rd:76', 'containerInstanceArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:container-instance/7431f0a6-8fc5-4eff-8196-32f77d286a61', 'overrides': {'containerOverrides': [{'name': 'foobar-testing', 'command': ['./bin/generate-features.sh', '2018-09-11']}]}, 'lastStatus': 'STOPPED', 'desiredStatus': 'STOPPED', 'cpu': '4096', 'memory': '60000', 'containers': [{'containerArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:container/0d5cc553-f894-4f9a-b17c-9f80f7ce8d0a', 'taskArn': 'arn:aws:ecs:us-east-1:111111111111:task/32d43a1d-fbc7-4659-815d-9133bde11cdc', 'name': 'foobar-testing', 'lastStatus': 'RUNNING', 'networkBindings': [], 'networkInterfaces': [], 'healthStatus': 'UNKNOWN'}], 'startedBy': 'Airflow', 'version': 3, 'stoppedReason': 'Host EC2 (instance i-02cf23bbd5ae26194) terminated.', 'connectivity': 'CONNECTED', 'connectivityAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 6, 30, 245000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'pullStartedAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 6, 32, 748000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'pullStoppedAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 6, 59, 748000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'createdAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 6, 30, 245000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'startedAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 0, 7, 0, 748000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'stoppingAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 1, 2, 0, 91000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'stoppedAt': datetime.datetime(2018, 9, 12, 1, 2, 0, 91000, tzinfo=tzlocal()), 'group': 'family:foobar-testing_dataEngineering_rd', 'launchType': 'EC2', 'attachments': [], 'healthStatus': 'UNKNOWN'}], 'failures': [], 'ResponseMetadata': {'RequestId': '758c791f-b627-11e8-83f7-2b76f4796ed2', 'HTTPStatusCode': 200, 'HTTPHeaders': {'server': 'Server', 'date': 'Wed, 12 Sep 2018 01:02:02 GMT', 'content-type': 'application/x-amz-json-1.1', 'content-length': '1412', 'connection': 'keep-alive', 'x-amzn-requestid': '758c791f-b627-11e8-83f7-2b76f4796ed2'}, 'RetryAttempts': 0}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the ECS Operator to include a check for this failure condition and raise an `AirflowException`.\r\n\r\nI've also updated the `setup.py` to include `unittest2` in the `devel` section when using Python 2. The tests depend on `unittest2` being installed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests\r\n\r\n- test_host_terminated_raises\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1.

title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3187\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe Airflow gif is extremely fast, this can be annoying. For this reason I would like to propose to make it slower. Also for people who can't handle fast changing pictures this can lead to pain in the eyes.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-11T09:55:03Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T12:14:03Z","closed_at":"2018-10-12T12:13:58Z","merged_at":"2018-10-12T12:13:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"7ae0fe2bb49787f07adb0f08907454acda3728f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/a38e06dd4d0361ad0aa7bc682b37de2007b341e2","head":{"label":"PaulVelthuis93:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"a38e06dd4d0361ad0aa7bc682b37de2007b341e2","user":{"login":"PaulVelthuis93","id":5030617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzA2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5030617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93","html_url":"https://github.com/PaulVelthuis93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152567368,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI1NjczNjg=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"PaulVelthuis93/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PaulVelthuis93","id":5030617,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzA2MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5030617?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93","html_url":"https://github.com/PaulVelthuis93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PaulVelthuis93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PaulVelthuis93/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Jira\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"\\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-2636\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThere was a NoneType exception when the task failure duration was null in the database that was causing the duration page to not load. I added a null check so that the page now loads.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI tested this in the Stripe fork of Airflow and it fixes this issue.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [ ] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-11T05:36:33Z","updated_at":"2019-05-28T22:57:26Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T22:57:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eab7bf8dc47b3c7efa0cfd506432a7c5d89fd059","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/5fdb9dd870c041ca8b1e6acfa3322a3cedd4416d","head":{"label":"helenweng-stripe:hw/duration--NoneType","ref":"hw/duration--NoneType","sha":"5fdb9dd870c041ca8b1e6acfa3322a3cedd4416d","user":{"login":"helenweng-stripe","id":42354807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzU0ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42354807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe","html_url":"https://github.com/helenweng-stripe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152498311,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI0OTgzMTE=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"helenweng-stripe/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"helenweng-stripe","id":42354807,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMzU0ODA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42354807?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe","html_url":"https://github.com/helenweng-stripe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/helenweng-stripe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/helenweng-stripe/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nTo have a `%` appear in the config file, it needs to appear as `%%`. However the way we were generating the temporary config for `airflow run` it would loose that escaping and cause a config error.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the way we generate that temp config by using methods built-in to ConfigParser to get the raw values (rather than grubbing around with `deepcopy()`). I have left this PR as three individual commits as I think it will be easier to review in it's current form. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [X] https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3099\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nRather than looping through and setting each config variable\r\nindividually, and having to know which sections are optional and which\r\naren't, instead we can just call a single function on ConfigParser and\r\nit will read the config from the dict, and more importantly here, never\r\nerror about missing sections - it will just create them as needed.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3177) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `scheduler_heartbeat` metric exposed with the statsd integration is a gauge. I'm proposing to change the gauge to a counter for a better integration with Prometheus via the [statsd_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter.)\r\n\r\nRather than pointing Airflow at an actual statsd server, you can point it at this exporter, which will accumulate the metrics and expose them to be scraped by Prometheus at /metrics. The problem is that once this value is set when the scheduler runs its first loop, it will always be exposed to Prometheus as 1. The scheduler can crash, or be turned off and the statsd exporter will report a 1 until it is restarted and rebuilds its internal state.\r\n\r\nBy turning this metric into a counter, we can detect an issue with the scheduler by graphing and alerting using a rate. If the rate of change of the counter drops below what it should be at (determined by the scheduler_heartbeat_secs setting), we can fire an alert.\r\n\r\nThis should be helpful for adoption in Kubernetes environments where Prometheus is pretty much the standard.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: No existing tests around statsd\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8

Any config option that is a\r\npassword should be able to be provided via a _cmd version.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason: None needed really?\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - Updated docs to

Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3078) issue and references it in the PR title.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nAdd GceInstanceStartOperator, GceInstanceStopOperator and GceSetMachineTypeOperator.\r\n\r\nEach operator includes:\r\n- core logic\r\n- input params validation\r\n- unit tests\r\n- presence in the example DAG\r\n- docstrings\r\n- How-to and Integration documentation\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in GceHook error checking if response is 200 OK was added:\r\n\r\nSome types of errors are only visible in the response's \"error\" field\r\nand the overall HTTP response is 200 OK.\r\n\r\nThat is why apart from checking if status is \"done\" we also check\r\nif \"error\" is empty, and if not an exception is raised with error\r\nmessage extracted from the \"error\" field of the response.\r\n\r\nIn this commit we also separated out Body Field Validator to\r\nseparate module in tools - this way it can be reused between\r\nvarious GCP operators, it has proven to be usable in at least\r\ntwo of them now.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests:\r\n`test_gcp_function_operator`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-08T17:27:28Z","updated_at":"2018-10-10T09:49:58Z","closed_at":"2018-10-10T09:49:58Z","merged_at":"2018-10-10T09:49:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"cdbdcae7c0645ac2987360fced43407202716b99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4022/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4022/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4022/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/7005dd7eda731820f012a385d8d33f095c5ee3a3","head":{"label":"PolideaInternal:master","ref":"master","sha":"7005dd7eda731820f012a385d8d33f095c5ee3a3","user":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":147329695,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDczMjk2OTU=","name":"airflow","full_name":"PolideaInternal/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"PolideaInternal","id":31278126,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMxMjc4MTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31278126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal","html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/PolideaInternal/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/PolideaInternal/airflow","description":"Apache

sure you have checked _all_ steps below.\r\n\r\n### Jira\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow Jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n  - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-3195\r\n  - In case you are fixing a typo in the documentation you can prepend your commit with \\[AIRFLOW-XXX\\], code changes always need a Jira issue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nWhen the druid hook is used for ingestion it would be helpful to log the ingestion spec and the resulting task id.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n`nosetests -v tests/hooks/test_druid_hook.py` ran successfully\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n\r\n- [x] My commits all reference Jira issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n  1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n  1. Subject is limited to 50 characters (not including Jira issue reference)\r\n  1. Subject does not end with a period\r\n  1. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n  1. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n  1. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [x] In case of new functionality, my PR adds documentation that describes how to use it.\r\n  - When adding new operators/hooks/sensors, the autoclass documentation generation needs to be added.\r\n\r\n### Code Quality\r\n\r\n- [x] Passes `git diff upstream/master -u -- \"*.py\" | flake8 --diff`\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-08T14:29:57Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T12:11:17Z","closed_at":"2018-10-12T12:11:17Z","merged_at":"2018-10-12T12:11:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"536c5abc063e6e795730b027ca45148f48ed8df1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4018/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/4018/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/4018/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/89c086dcff348f1803e3f829bc139430802164d0","head":{"label":"awelsh93:feature-druid-add-log","ref":"feature-druid-add-log","sha":"89c086dcff348f1803e3f829bc139430802164d0","user":{"login":"awelsh93","id":32643586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjQzNTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32643586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93","html_url":"https://github.com/awelsh93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":143706678,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDM3MDY2Nzg=","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"awelsh93/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"awelsh93","id":32643586,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjQzNTg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32643586?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93","html_url":"https://github.com/awelsh93","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/awelsh93/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/awelsh93/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache
