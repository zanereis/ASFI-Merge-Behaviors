finally looked into something that's been bugging me for a while:\npython print() statements not showing up in docker logs. Digging a bit,\nturns out in non-interactive mode (aka docker environment), the print\nstatements are buffered, meaning they don't show up in logs until the\nprogram exits. From what I read this is a legacy behavior around the\nconcern that printing is more expensive than writing to file. Anyhow,\ncreated confusion for me trying to debug with prints in the past, I\nwould print, and to see the output I'd have to save a file, which - in\nour dev environments - triggers flask to restart, and flush the buffer,\nmeaning prints aren't in-line with logger.info statements. Anyhow,\nI learned to use logger instead of prints while debugging for that reason.\nAnother byproduct of that is buffer growth, which can explain at least a\nbit of memory leak in our environments. Everything you print stays\nin-memory until the interpreted exits - minimal, but could see potential\nissues with that. In any case solution is as simple as setting\nPYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 in our docker containers to solve. Seems like a no\nbrainer.\n\n","created_at":"2025-01-09T01:04:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-09T03:12:27Z","closed_at":"2025-01-09T03:12:22Z","merged_at":"2025-01-09T03:12:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"840a920abade19e4b00c36e925e0ff448fcf5b12","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":395943469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzOTU5NDM0Njk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/install:docker","name":"install:docker","color":"456268","default":false,"description":"Installation

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nBoth the `/api/v1/chart/{{id}}/cache_screenshot/` and `/api/v1/dashboard/{{id}}/cache_dashboard_screenshot/` endpoints enable generating and retrieve a screenshot from the respective resource.\r\n\r\nThe endpoints accept sending force=true in the query parameters, but currently this parameter does nothing. It should instead invalidate the previous image and generate a new one.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a fix as well as some improvements to the functioning of the thumbnail cache, such that the status of the screenshot can be tracked by the relevant api endpoints as well.\r\n\r\nRather than storing plain bytes objects in the cache, this PR introduces a new class `ScreenshotCachePayload` which can store the image bytes as well as `timestamp` and `status` values. Status values include \r\n`Pending`: screenshot is awaiting being processed\r\n`Computing`: screenshot job has been picked up by the worker and is processing\r\n`Updated`: screenshot has been updated\r\n`Error`: an error occured while the webdriver was processing the screenshot task.\r\n\r\nWhile in a `Computing` or `Updated` state, requests to regenerate the screenshot will be blocked unless the `force` parameter is set to `True`\r\n\r\nAdditional `task_status` and `updated_at` fields have been added to 202 response payload for endpoints as follows:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"cache_key\": \"ef13dd170eda0581d74a5d1c84983778\",\r\n  \"dashboard_url\": \"http://superset_app:8088/superset/dashboard/15/\",\r\n  \"image_url\": \"http://superset_app:8088/api/v1/dashboard/15/thumbnail/ef13dd170eda0581d74a5d1c84983778/\",\r\n  \"task_status\": \"Pending\",\r\n  \"updated_at\": \"2025/01/16-14:58:34\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce the bug\r\nCreate a chart.\r\nPerform a modification in the data.\r\nSend a GET request to /api/v1/chart/{{id}}/cache_screenshot/?q=(force:!t).\r\nAccess the URL returned in the image_url value.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\ntests have been added in the `tests/unit_tests/utils/screenshot_tests.py`\r\n\r\nFor manual testing\r\n- [ ] ping the `/api/v1/chart/<pk>/cache_screenshot/` endpoint. Ensure that a 202 response is received.\r\n- [ ] refresh periodically until status changes to \"Computing.\" Then again to \"Updated\"\r\n- [ ] once updated, ensure the screenshot url returns the proper screenshot.\r\n- [ ] refresh again, and ensure the status has not changed from \"Updated\"\r\n- [ ] ping the endpoint again with force parameter `/api/v1/chart/cache_screenshot/<pk>/?q=(force:!t)` to ensure that the status changes to \"Pending\"\r\n\r\nRepeat the steps for the `POST /api/v1/dashboard/<pk>/cache_dashboard_screenshot/`\r\n\r\n- [ ] access the `GET /api/v1/chart/<pk>/thumbnail/<digest>` endpoint to ensure that a 202 response is received.\r\n- [ ] access again once the status changes to \"Updated\" ensure that the endpoint results in a 200 response with the screenshot.\r\n- [ ] repeat with `GET /api/v1/dashboard/<pk>/thumbnail/<digest>`\r\n \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

I noticed that despite the service dependencies state in our docker-compose files, the all start on top of each other, which isn't good or as expected. We want for the `superset-init` service/scripts to finish prior to starting other services, and ideally services being in a healthy state before booting up the others that depend on them. There are newish semantics in docker-compose to enable this, so will implement here in this PR.\r\n\r\nImprovements on this PR:\r\n- `superset-init` waits for redis and db to be started (not really an issue, but cleaner)\r\n- `superset-app` and worker-related stuff waits on `superset-init` to be fully completed and successful, so the app shouldn't be there and confused until the superset's database is ready (setup, migrations, load_examples, ...)\r\n- removing `--force` from loading examples (this mostly forces a data reload from my understanding), and we really don't need to reload at the examples every time we fire up compose! this saves a bunch of work and log output\r\n- somehow docker-compose doesn't see `print()` outputs, so moving some example-related stuff to `logger.info` and `logger.debug` to clean the startup output and see what it's actually doing\r\n- moving default log level in dev to `info` (from `debug`)\n\n<!-- Korbit AI PR Description Start -->\n## Description by Korbit AI\n\n### What change is being made?\nReorder Docker Compose service startup sequence and enhance logging by implementing custom conditions for service dependencies, introduce environment variable configuration for logging levels, and refactor logging statements from print to use the logger across various example scripts.\n\n### Why are these changes being made?\nThe changes ensure that services like `superset-init` start only after dependent services are ready, reducing startup issues. Additionally, the enhanced logging options improve transparency and troubleshooting during the service lifecycle. These adjustments increase reliability and provide better insights into the service operation without print statements, utilizing configurable logging levels instead.\n\n> Is this description stale?

observed an issue where the GHA for docker builds fails when the PR is opened from a fork (as opposed to the main repo itself). This is related to the fact that the job tried to push the image to dockerhub, and doesn't have the creds `${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}` in that context.\r\n\r\nNow there are some intricacies here:\r\n- we should only push images on `push` events on the main branch (we don't need to publish images for every PR)\r\n- we can only `--load` when building single-platform manifests, docker will

This enhancement also ensures that the inputs sync to maintain valid ranges dynamically, improving usability. The accompanying tests are updated to ensure the new input behavior works as expected and edge cases are properly handled.\r\n\r\n> Is this description stale?

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation of Ant Design theme is based on Superset having a single light theme. To enable theming capabilities colors need to be seperated to their own lightConfig. This pr aims to do that. After this, adding a dark mode can be done by copying the light theme and changing colors.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nOverrides FAB's LocaleView to redirect to the request's referrer instead of relying on the session page history as [suggested here](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/12768#issuecomment-2376141202).\r\n\r\nThis isn't a perfect solution, but it keeps the change very close to the actual issue.\r\n\r\nNote that this view is marked out in the tests as an \"unsecured\" view, because we need to be able to change the current locale even when logged out (so that the login page can be presented in the user's preferred language).\r\n\r\n**Rejected alternatives**\r\n\r\n1. Call `update_redirect()` whenever a GET view is rendered ([like this](https://github.com/apache/superset/compare/master...open-craft:superset:jill/update_redirect)).\r\n   This is more in line with how Flask AppBuilder works (and was [recommended here](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder/pull/1679#discussion_r702709749)).\r\n   However, this only works for pages rendered by Superset's backend, and most Superset pages are rendered by the frontend.\r\n2. Hook into the [frontend's action logging](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/7c903236498281f34970012e701250edef1b1493/superset-frontend/src/views/App.tsx#L54-L69) to update the page history, e.g when a `LOG_ACTIONS_SPA_NAVIGATION` event is logged to the backend.\r\n  This approach felt even hackier than the one posted here, and farther from the issue it addresses.\r\n  Also, Flask AppBuilder only provides the `update_redirect()` method which uses the current `request.url`, so we'd need to add another method that could use a different `url`.\r\n\r\nFixes: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/12768\r\nPart of: https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/30334\r\nFixes: https://github.com/openedx/openedx-aspects/issues/299\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bcdefa5-46d5-4173-98cc-884384af233d\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70b32340-7f23-482d-a33b-8347aa5000b0\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Load Superset with multiple languages enabled.\r\n2. Visit any page.\r\n3. Change your current language using the language switcher menu on the top right.\r\n4. Ensure that your language is changed and you're redirect back to the page in step 2.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

SUMMARY\r\nI picked up an existing PR that was no longer progressing ([PR 30318](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30318)). The idea is to make the language dynamic and configurable in the context of embedding a dashboard. To achieve this, I added a \"locale\" key in the urlParams, which allows passing the desired language code. Thus, in an embedding context, you just need to manage this code dynamically so that the user can view the dashboards in their preferred language.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

#27988\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### fix(bulk_select): allow users to tag a saved query if using bulk select\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThis PR addresses an issue where  users were unable to tag objects despite having the necessary permissions. The changes ensure that the tagging functionality correctly validates user ownership or edit permissions and allows tagging where applicable. Additionally, it refines error handling to avoid unnecessary warnings while maintaining robust validation for invalid objects.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n![1736432737670 (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2059d533-9370-43da-b65b-626c38da61b9)\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1.

SUMMARY\r\nWe're currently using Helm v. 3.5.4 on CI, which is 3.5 years old. To support OCI repos without experimental env variables, we need to bump to a more recent release. This bumps Helm to the latest stable version and bumps the Helm Chart patch to test it works as expected. It also incorporates changes from #31614 which were merged into the PR (see https://github.com/villebro/superset/pull/1).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

redirection URL for individual charts\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR modifies the Superset frontend functionality to allow setting and retrieving redirection URLs for individual charts. This feature enables users to configure and utilize specific redirection links directly from the control/setup panel of each chart. Additionally, the \"Ajna\" logo has been added for improved redirection functionality.\r\n\r\nKey changes include:\r\n\r\n- Added SetURL component in chart control panel for URL configuration\r\n- Implemented ShowURL component to display and handle redirections\r\n- Integrated Ajna logo for redirection visual element\r\n- Enhanced dashboard functionality to support per-chart URL redirections\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"483\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de239000-903c-4e1a-83ba-5f218759c8fa\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"298\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72ff97b9-4f73-4cc8-8cf0-2d013f49ffc6\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

I did some work to use `uv pip install` in place of plain `pip` in our docker images. This made builds significantly faster, but broke compatibility between some docker compose setups.\r\n\r\nThe issue is around the fact that `docker-compose-image-tag` mounts the local, newer, docker bootstrap scripts into the image, and those have evolve to use `uv`, which isn't installed in the image.\r\n\r\nOne option would be to not mount the docker folder and use what's in the image, but I believe some of the script may have changed names or location, and `docker-compose-image-tag` specifies their location as it passes arguments to them.\r\n\r\nIn any case, and at least for now, I decided to simply conditionally use uv or plain pip in the docker scripts based on what's installed in the image.\r\n\r\nAlso added a CI step to make sure `docker compose -f

SUMMARY\r\nAs purposed in [SIP-111](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26395), this commit introduces the new SQL Lab sidebar UI using tree view structure.\r\n\r\n1. The database selector will be maintained, while the schema selector will be moved to a tree view.\r\n2. Change the dropdown UI for the table selector to a tree view for improved navigation.\r\n3. For databases that support catalogs, the catalog selector will be displayed under the database selector, and the tree will show the list of schemas for the corresponding category.\r\n4. Add a search box to allow users to find matches in both the datasource catalog and table metadata and schema for enhanced information retrieval.\r\n5. Caching and Action Buttons: **As proposed, it will include a force-refresh feature and modify the existing functionalities from the previous table/schema to be displayed under the dropdown action link**\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ae84002-e255-43a7-9064-c702d53ae682\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nGo to SQL Lab and

the large PR, but this is fairly tangled up, and working on fixing up theming probably requires some massive PRs as it's really hard to proceed PR-by-PR - especially during the holiday break...\r\n\r\n## Introducing less handlebars templates\r\n\r\nFirst. Clearly we should move away from `less` and commit to emotion/antd for theming Now deleting the less files is going to be difficult. In the meantime, I wanted to provide a way for less files to source from the main theme object. I decided to go with handlebars since that should be part of the build process.\r\n\r\nConsiderations:\r\n- this is temporary, goal is to get rid of less altogether. Having this enables layering the theming work, and allows to make the theme DRY, instead of referncing the same colors a bunch of times\r\n- eventually could remove the `.less` files from the repo, and make sure they are dynamically generated on every builds. In the meantime I thought I'd leave them here, and we can instruct people to alter `.less.hds` files and run `npm run compile-less` on demand, if/when altering the main theme\r\n\r\n## Large refactor - what's in this PR?\r\n- less templates - as described above\r\n- New Theme object and subpackage as commented in the theming SIP\r\n- Refactoring/fixing out-of-theme, css-heavy components\r\n  - Alert - vanilla is better!\r\n  - AceEditor\r\n  - EmptyState refactor (that component WAS A MESS, felt almost like on-purpose maze of indirections), fixed the svg so it can receive currentColor as opposed to using an <img> tag - required for making it themable/dark-modable\r\n  - ErrorAlert refactor (also a huge mess, simplifying quite a bit here)\r\n- Making antd components more vanilla\r\n- Getting rid of a bunch of CSS\r\n- Start aligning our css-in-js across the app to use the `antd` theme tokens\r\n- storybook improvements\r\n  - improving the theme stories \r\n\r\n## what's NOT in this PR? - yet to come\r\n- more `theme.antd` referencing in emotion\r\n- move CSS / LESS deletion\r\n- antd v5 migrations\r\n- ability to configure an antd `ThemeConfig` as the theme setup, this will

This also means that since users create the router - there's no longer any difference in the rendering aspect for memory/browser/hash routers (which only impacts router/history creation) - so we can get rid of those and trim to a simple <code>RouterProvider</code></p>\n<pre lang=\"jsx\"><code>// Before\nfunction App() {\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n    &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Layout /&gt;}&gt;\n      &lt;Route index element={&lt;Home /&gt;}&gt;\n    &lt;/Route&gt;\n  &lt;DataBrowserRouter&gt;\n}\n<p>// After<br />\nlet router = createBrowserRouter([{<br />\npath: &quot;/&quot;,<br />\nelement: &lt;Layout /&gt;,<br />\nchildren: [{<br />\nindex: true,<br />\n</code></pre></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/31510\n\nWhen using docker-compose-non-dev.yml or docker-compose.yml, we mount the `docker/` directory in the container. This means we use the logic in the docker-related scripts from whatever branch the user has checked out locally into the container, and. Since `uv` was introduced recently, older images don't have it, and the script fail.\n\nHere to unblock I'm adding `pip install uv` to the bootstrap script, which should enable things to run.\n\nMoving forward, it'd be better if docker-compose would NOT mount the `docker/` directory, and instead use the `docker/` directory from the image. This would ensure that the scripts are always in sync with the image. This is a bit more involved, so I'm going with the simpler fix for now. This also requires having the right entrypoints / CMD instruciton set IN the image. Unclear how whether it's setup ok in older releases, would require pulling each release branch and looking into the entrypoints/CMD instructions in their respective Dockerfiles.\n","created_at":"2024-12-20T19:12:36Z","updated_at":"2024-12-20T21:22:57Z","closed_at":"2024-12-20T21:22:53Z","merged_at":"2024-12-20T21:22:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd9c2b399ead051496b639dcc1347a7f8346f481","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3815127807,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7jZjr_","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/doc","name":"doc","color":"6f9eaf","default":false,"description":"Namespace

SUMMARY\r\nA short-term fix for #31510. The install process of `docker-compose-image-tag.yml` is broken because the master branch files like [docker/docker-bootstrap.sh](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/docker/docker-bootstrap.sh) now use `uv` but that package is missing in official versions like `4.1.1`.\r\n\r\nHard-coding a version here is not ideal but this gets new users going again. After the next official release cut from the main/master branch, if `docker compose -f docker-compose-image-tag.yml up` again works without specifying a certain tag, we can revert this PR.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nTest the steps in the quickstart and see that it works now.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue:

SUMMARY\r\nAs part of the 5.0 breaking window, this PR executes the following proposals:\r\n- [23 - Force legacy Area chart migration and delete NVD3 plugin](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345/views/1#)\r\n- [42 - Migrate Line Chart (legacy) to ECharts Line Chart and remove code (was previously deprecated)](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345/views/1#)\r\n- [54 - Migrate and remove the legacy Heatmap chart](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345/views/1#)\r\n- [80 - Migrate and remove the NVD3 Bar Chart in favor of ECharts](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345/views/1#)\r\n- [84 - Migrate and remove the legacy Sankey chart](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345/views/1#)\r\n- [85 - Remove the unused Sankey Loop chart](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345/views/1#)\r\n- [86 - Migrate and remove the legacy Histogram chart](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345/views/1#)\r\n- [88 - Remove the Event Flow chart](https://github.com/orgs/apache/projects/345/views/1#)\r\n\r\nI decided to do it all in a single PR to have a single migration for the charts. There's also many code blocks that were removed that touches multiple visualization types at the same time and it would be more complex to remove it in parts. Another important factor was the ability to execute the tests once, given that we need to check if the example charts are loaded correctly. In summary, the benefits outweigh the review complexity.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n- Check the examples are loaded correctly\r\n- Check that the charts in your production environment are all migrated and loaded correctly\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\n\n<!-- Korbit AI PR Description Start -->\n## Description by Korbit AI\n\n### What change is being made?\n\nRemove legacy charts (Area, Bar, Event Flow, Heatmap, Histogram, Line, Sankey, and Sankey Loop) and migrate them to their ECharts counterparts, while updating relevant tests and dependencies.\n\n### Why are these changes being made?\n\nThe legacy charts were deprecated and have been fully migrated to ECharts versions to take advantage of modern features and better maintainability, except for Event Flow and Sankey Loop charts, which have been removed due to not being actively maintained or widely used. This refactor reduces codebase clutter and ensures developers work with up-to-date and supported charting tools.\n\n> Is this description stale?

Description by Korbit AI\n\n### What change is being made?\n\nRedesign the label components to enhance UI elements across the application by introducing new styling, reworked storybook stories, and reusable label components.\n\n### Why are these changes being made?\n\nThe changes aim to improve the clarity, functionality, and visual consistency of labels throughout the app. New components such as `DatasetTypeLabel` and `PublishedLabel` were introduced to encapsulate reusable label styles and logic, reducing redundancy and potential styling errors. Enhancements in the Theme storybook improve the visualization of theme color palettes, enabling better theming and design coherence.\n\n> Is this description stale?

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAdded a LOADERS variable in the configuration files config.py and superset_config.py:\r\n  - config.py default value → LOADERS = [{\"src\": \"/static/assets/images/loading.gif\"}]\r\n  - superset_config.py → LOADERS = [{\"src\": \"/static/assets/images/YOUR_GIF.gif\"}] (for exemple)\r\n\r\nManaged the loader in Superset's base HTML skeleton:\r\n  - superset/superset/templates/superset/basic.html\r\n  \r\nRetrieved the custom loader in Superset API endpoints:\r\n  - superset/superset/views/core.py → Added an endpoint to retrieve the loader from the configuration file.\r\n\r\nManaged the loader in Superset's React.js elements:\r\n  - superset/superset-frontend/src/components/Loading/index.tsx → Fetches the custom loader via the new endpoint.\r\n\r\nI'm very new to Superset and the open-source world, and this is my first attempt. I'm open to any advice on how to make this cleaner if needed :)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nDon't setup the LOADERS in superset_config.py file to see the default loader. Then add tyour custom gif to see the difference.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in
