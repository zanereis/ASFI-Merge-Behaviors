Proposed changes\r\n\r\nDoris Manager is a platform product that integrates one-click automatic installation, deployment, management, monitoring, and tuning of doris clusters. Its service is independent of Doris and aims to provide convenient user functions through a graphical interface. Manager is compatible with multi-cluster mode, and its functions are divided into general functions and single-cluster functions as a whole.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #6422 ) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-11T09:31:29Z","updated_at":"2021-08-13T02:59:06Z","closed_at":"2021-08-13T02:59:05Z","merged_at":"2021-08-13T02:59:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"9f4293e0b203004399e66318ca2a5297c9588aeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1099563192,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk5NTYzMTky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/feature","name":"kind/feature","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\nfix #6327\r\n### Analysis\r\n#### First case\r\n```\r\nSELECT a.x FROM\r\n(SELECT '01' x) a \r\nINNER JOIN\r\n(SELECT '01' x UNION all SELECT '02') b\r\n```\r\nThe length of the tnode.union_node.const_expr_lists obtained by BE UnionNode is not equal to the length of the materialized slots of the tuple.\r\nIn UnionNode::prepare, DCHECK_EQ(exprs.size(), _tuple_desc->slots().size()); will prompt.\r\n\r\n#### Second case\r\n```\r\nSELECT a.x \r\nFROM (SELECT '01' x) a \r\nINNER JOIN \r\n(SELECT C_CUSTKEY from CUSTOMER \r\nUNION all \r\nSELECT C_CUSTKEY from CUSTOMER) b;\r\n```\r\nmaterializedResultExprs is empty when new DataPartition() in new setOperationFragment().\r\n\r\n### The reason for materialized number of resultExprs/constExprs and output slot of Union Node is inconsistent:\r\nThe reason is that select stmt and on-clause does not contain the slot of the union node on the build side of Join, so no slot in the union node tuple is materialized during sql parse.\r\n\r\nAfter the union node on the join build side is created, when calling SetOperationNode::init(), it will decide which resultExprs/constExprs to put into the materializedResultExprs/materializedConstExprs according to the materialized slot, because no slot is materialized in the union node tuple, So materializedResultExprs/materializedConstExprs is empty.\r\n\r\nAfter the join node itself is created, the materializeTableResultForCrossJoinOrCountStar() method is called to ensure that at least one slot of the join build side node tuple is materialized, so the slot corresponding to `x` in the union node tuple is materialized.\r\n\r\nUnder normal circumstances, will call SetOperationNode::init() again at the end of createSetOperationNodeFragment() to update materializedResultExprs/materializedConstExprs. to ensure that eventually the resultExprs/constExprs and the corresponding output slot have the same materialized state.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, because the slot of the union node only has constants, `setOperationNode.getChildren().isEmpty()=true`, will not call SetOperationNode::init() again at the end of createSetOperationNodeFragment(), resulting in the number of materialized slots being different from the number of materializedConstExprs.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, new setOperationFragment() before calling SetOperationNode::init() again\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nMoved computePassthrough() and the materialized position of resultExprs/constExprs from this.init to this.finalize, and will not call SetOperationNode::init() again at the end of createSetOperationNodeFragment().\r\n\r\n#### Reasons for move computePassthrough():\r\nBecause the byteSize of the tuple corresponding to OlapScanNode is updated after singleNodePlanner.createSingleNodePlan() and before singleNodePlan.finalize(), calling computePassthrough() in SetOperationNode::init() may not be able to accurately determine whether the child is pass through. In the previous logic , Will call SetOperationNode::init() again at the end of createSetOperationNodeFragment().\r\n\r\n#### Reasons for move materialized position of resultExprs/constExprs:\r\nBecause the output slot is materialized at various positions in the planner stage, this is to ensure that eventually the resultExprs/constExprs and the corresponding output slot have the same materialized state.\r\nAnd the order of materialized resultExprs must be the same as the order of children adjusted by computePassthrough(), so resultExprs materialized must be placed after computePassthrough().\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #6327) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x]

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nfix #6369\r\n\r\nThe system view names in information_schema are case-insensitive, but you should not refer to one of these using different cases within the same statement.  \r\n\r\nThe following sql is correct：\r\n```\r\nselect * from information_schema.TAbles where TAbles.ENGINE = 'Doris';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following sql is wrong because `TAbles` and `tables` are used:\r\n```\r\nselect * from information_schema.TAbles order by tables.CREATE_TIME;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #6369) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-04T07:19:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-07T13:33:29Z","closed_at":"2021-08-07T13:33:29Z","merged_at":"2021-08-07T13:33:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"36fe112eb70c149e58edaf21acc333f57e91a578","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nFix #6366 \r\n\r\nThere is a bloom filter for each data page in a column which has bloom filter index. `_has_null` flag can help to judge whether `null` exists in a data page. If `null` value is added to a data page, `_has_null` will be set `true`. After bloom filter for a data page finished, `_has_null`should be reset to `false` to prepare for next data page.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThe problem I want to solve is described in #6355.\r\nThis CL mainly changes:\r\n\r\n1. Support compacting tablets under alter operations\r\n\r\n   On BE side, the compaction logic will select tablets which state is \"TABLET_NOTREADY\" to do cumulative compaction.\r\n\r\n2. Remove \"alter_task\" field in tablet's meta on BE side.\r\n\r\n   \"alter_task\" field is never used long time ago\r\n\r\n3. Support doing delete operation when table is doing alter operation.\r\n\r\n   Previously, when a table is doing alter operation, execution of delete will return error: Table's state is not NORMAL.\r\n   But now, delete can be executed successfully only if the condition column is not under schema change.\r\n   And delete condition will be applied to all materialized indexes.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #6355) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-03T03:46:14Z","updated_at":"2021-08-07T13:32:26Z","closed_at":"2021-08-07T13:32:26Z","merged_at":"2021-08-07T13:32:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"c6aa37f5efc931f740d9a56b2e2f4ab96480ad06","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965628,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2Mjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/improvement","name":"kind/improvement","color":"84b6eb","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen producing compaction task for a particular disk, each tablet on BE will be traversed.  Usually, there are several disks on the BE, so that most of tablets locate on other disks which should be skipped.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nCurrently, `ltrim` and `rtrim` function can only compare one character with blank at a time. For 128 bits register, it can compare 16 characters at a time using SIMD. Therefore, using SIMD can speedup performance greatly.  When there is less than 2 blanks, vetorized-ltrim has the same performance with non-vectorized-ltrim, but when blanks are more than 3, performance can be improved more than 2-3 times.
