of `Use kubeconfig as one of the optional parameters for creating KubernetesHook` closes: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/39227\r\n\r\nWhen we use `KubernetesPodOperator`, we need to create `KubernetesHook` in order to connect to Kubernetes services. There are currently 3 supported methods for creating `KubernetesHook`:\r\n1、environment variable method,\r\n2、kubeconfig_path method,\r\n3、db connection variable method.\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/28948186/b0290ae3-ae54-460b-8ac2-f053a982d7fd)\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, these methods are all from the perspective of the airflow system owner. The airflow owner can change the variables of the airflow_worker, create and modify files in the airflow_worker, and operate the airflow_db. However, in many cases, the users of airflow are not The owner of airflow, The user does not have the authority to make changes to the airflow_worker, nor does it have read and write permissions to

#38836 \r\nAlternative to #38876 \r\n\r\nDo the encryption in the migration itself, and fix support for offline migrations as well.\r\n\r\nThe offline up migration won't actually encrypt the trigger kwargs as there isn't a safe way to accomplish that, so the decryption processes checks and short circuits if it isn't encrypted.\r\n\r\nThe offline down migration will now print out a warning that the offline migration will fail if there are any running triggers. I think this is the best we can do for that scenario (and folks willing to do offline migrations will hopefully be able to understand the situation).\r\n\r\nThis also solves the \"encrypting the already encrypted kwargs\" bug in

Until SQLAlchemy 1.4 and assuming a bidirectional relationship between a TaskInstance and a DagRun, if a DagRun object is already in a Session the TaskInstance object gets put into the Session as well. This behavior is deprecated for [removal](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/changelog/migration_14.html#cascade-backrefs-behavior-deprecated-for-removal-in-2-0) in SQLAlchemy 2.0.\r\n\r\nIn order to mentain the actual behavior and to fix the warning, we need to ensure that both objects are either not in the session or are in the session when they are associated with each other.

Apache Airflow Provider for Power BI.\r\n\r\n## Operators\r\n### PowerBIDatasetRefreshOperator\r\nThe operator triggers the Power BI dataset refresh and pushes the details of refresh in Xcom. It can accept the following parameters:\r\n\r\n* `dataset_id`: The dataset Id.\r\n* `group_id`: The workspace Id.\r\n* `wait_for_termination`: (Default value: True) Wait until the pre-existing or current triggered refresh completes before exiting.\r\n* `force_refresh`: When enabled, it will force refresh the dataset again, after pre-existing ongoing refresh request is terminated.\r\n* `timeout`: Time in seconds to wait for a dataset to reach a terminal status for non-asynchronous waits. Used only if ``wait_for_termination`` is True.\r\n* `check_interval`: Number of seconds to wait before rechecking the refresh status.\r\n\r\n## Hooks\r\n### PowerBI Hook\r\nA hook to interact with Power BI.\r\n* `powerbi_conn_id`: Airflow Connection ID that contains the connection information for the Power BI account used for authentication.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* #### Xcom Integration: The Power BI Dataset refresh operator enriches the Xcom with essential fields for downstream tasks:\r\n1. `powerbi_dataset_refresh_id`: Request Id of the Dataset Refresh.\r\n2. `powerbi_dataset_refresh_status`: Refresh Status.\r\n    * `Unknown`: Refresh state is unknown or a refresh is in progress.\r\n    * `Completed`: Refresh successfully completed.\r\n    * `Failed`: Refresh failed (details in `powerbi_dataset_refresh_error`).\r\n    * `Disabled`: Refresh is disabled by a selective refresh.\r\n3. `powerbi_dataset_refresh_end_time`: The end date and time of the refresh (may be None if a refresh is in progress)\r\n4. `powerbi_dataset_refresh_error`: Failure error code in JSON format (None if no error)\r\n\r\n* #### External Monitoring link: The operator conveniently provides a redirect link to the Power BI UI for monitoring refreshes.\r\n\r\n## Sample DAG to use the plugin.\r\n\r\nCheck out the sample DAG code below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\nfrom operators.powerbi_refresh_dataset_operator import

That way we have the same approach as with the HttpHook and HttpOperator as in the future the dream would be that both could become one.  This is also in line with the wanted approach in Airflow to have less operators (e.g. thus more generic one) which can use interchangeable hooks to achieve the same goal but with less operators (and thus more specialized hooks).\r\n\r\nThe Hook will also handle HTTP statuc codes from the response, if not valid the corresponding AirflowException will be thrown.\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

default implementation of filter_permitted_menu_items had a subtle side-effect. The filtering on child items was done in-place and modified the menu itself, so it was enough to get the same worker serve requests for multiple users for the same menu to get the items removed for subsequent user - even if they had permission to see it.\r\n\r\nDeepcopying the menu items before filtering them should fix the problem\r\n\r\nFixes: #39204\r\nFixes: #39135\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

First of all I fixed an issue that was not listed in the orginal issue. I assume it might was missing as it a mysql specfic, e.g. [example](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/utils/db_cleanup.py#L166) Thus it would make sense to run the checks for mysql and any other supported db as well.\r\n\r\nSecond I could not fix `airflow/cli/commands/task_command.py:202` and I am not really sure if this is really something that needs to be fixed. I went through the SQA docs and it might be a warning we have in 1.4 that will be gone whenever we have 2.0 without any real error. But hard to tell. I will further investigate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reported in core\r\n\r\n- [x] airflow/models/taskinstance.py:1869 fixed by #39195\r\n- [x] airflow/models/taskinstance.py:1871 fixed by #39195\r\n\r\n- [x]

The issue with this is that the underlying kiota library (RequestInformation class) used by the msgraph-core library also encodes the values, which leads to double URL encoded values and thus giving issues, which I wasn't aware of until now when we had values with special characters in it.  So now only the keys of the query_parameters are URL encoded, I've added a unit test which verifies this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

PR implements #32561 in a different way. This caused a regression for our use case, where non-running task try logs weren't shown in UI for running tasks. This is due to us storing the logs on the worker with a Persistent Volume.\r\n\r\nInstead of never fetching the logs from the server for non-running task tries, try to fetch them if and only if there are no remote or executor logs available already.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#39149 \r\n\r\nWhen creating a container using the AzureContainerInstanceOperator, it would be good to be able to pass a specific dns configuration and log analytics workspace. These are already supported by the azure management api.\r\n\r\nNon-breaking change that adds some nice extra functionality. In some cases, providing an explicit dns config is required for private containers when existing VNet DNS is not picked up. (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64700687/how-to-get-azure-container-instances-using-my-dns-server). Adding the ability to send logs to an existing log analytics workspace is a nice quality of life addition for sending non-airflow, application specific logs.\r\n\r\nHappy to add more tests if

Also, this is my first PR here, so even against my best intentions, I might have missed something in the contributing guidelines, so all feedback and help is welcome :)\r\n\r\nBranch is freshly

The lack of appropriate error handling and resource cleanup led to subsequent retries encountering these errored clusters, attempting deletion, and resulting in pipeline failures. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is a simple workaround implemented several years ago for Google provider `project_id` default value being PROVIDE_PROJECT_ID that satisfy mypy checks for project_id being set. They way how `fallback_to_default_project_id` works is that across all the providers the project_id is actually set, even if technically it's default value is set to None.\r\n\r\nThis is similar typing workaround as we use for NEW_SESSION in the core of Airflow.\r\n\r\nThe workaround has not been applied consistently across all the google provider code and occasionally it causes MyPy complaining when newer version of a google library introduces more strict type checking and expects the provider_id to be set.\r\n\r\nThis PR applies the workaround across all the Google provider code.\r\n\r\nThis is - generally speaking a no-op operation. Nothing changes, except MyPy being aware that the project_id is actually going to be set even if it is technically set to None.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

we call Snowflake (and other DBs) to get schemas of tables used in particular queries. \r\n\r\nHowever, Snowflake [connector management is buggy](https://github.com/snowflakedb/snowflake-connector-python/issues/1567) and leaves us in a hanging, deadlocked state sometimes, which causes OpenLineage collection to fail and . \r\n\r\nThis PR prevents that by never calling Snowflake during OpenLineage method execution, and relying purely on information received from SQL parsing and Airflow Connection.\r\n\r\nThe negative consequence of that PR is lack of schema information in OpenLineage events, but this is a good tradeoff - most important feature of OpenLineage should be not affecting running
