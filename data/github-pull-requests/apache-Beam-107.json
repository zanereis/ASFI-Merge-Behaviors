`escapechar` parameter to Python TextIO transforms: `ReadFromText`,  `ReadAllFromText`:\r\n* escaped line delimiters are skipped when splitting, for example: `'aa\\\\\\naa\\n'` would result in 1 line `'aa\\\\\\naa'`\r\n* this is for line splitting only, so escapechars are not removed from the lines, they are supposed to be parsed separately, for example with `csv` library\r\n* escaped escape chars are also handled, so that if there are odd number of escape chars before line delimiter - it will be escaped, but if there are even number of escape chars - all are treated as escaped themselves and the line delimiter will be used for splitting\r\n* using `bytes` type for the `escapechar` in line with the custom delimiter feature, but keeping name `escapechar` as in the `csv` library (arguable)\r\n* only 1 byte `escapechar` length is supported (in line with `csv`)\r\n\r\nCloses: BEAM-13189\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is porting the fix in https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/15895 back onto the `aws` module for sdk v1.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/beam/pull/12583 introduced a mechanism to deduplicate elements per batch based on deduplication keys. Unfortunately the mechanism is not backwards compatible. If upgrading without setting the deduplication keys all elements end up with the same empty deduplication key. As a result only one element per batch is ever written to DynamoDB, everything else is lost.\r\n\r\nThis change makes sure elements are deduplicated based on element equality if no deduplication keys are provided.\r\n\r\nMissing unit tests for reads and writes are added to better catch such bugs in the future.\r\nBugs in DynamoDBIOTest (using localstack) are fixed, further improvements of this (proper integration testing) should be done in BEAM-7559.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

introduced a mechanism to deduplicate elements per batch based on deduplication keys. Unfortunately the mechanism is not backwards compatible. If upgrading without setting the deduplication keys all elements end up with the same empty deduplication key. As a result only one element per batch is ever written to DynamoDB, everything else is lost.\r\n\r\nThis change makes sure elements are deduplicated based on element equality if no deduplication keys are provided.\r\n\r\nMissing unit tests for reads and writes are added to better catch such bugs in the future.\r\nBugs in DynamoDBIOTest (using localstack) are fixed, further improvements of this (proper integration testing) should be done in BEAM-7559.\r\n\r\nThe same bug exists for aws (SDK v1). I'll follow up with another PR for that.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is a race condition being observed where we are passing the `InboundObserver` to the `outboundObserverFactory` [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/bee60cdc29d995170d4461692e391683ca7dcafd/sdks/java/fn-execution/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/fn/data/BeamFnDataGrpcMultiplexer2.java#L68). This allows for incoming calls to start before the BeamFnDataGrpcMultiplexer2 is fully initialized meaning that the erroredInstructionIds is accessed before it is initialized.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a general problem with how we connect the inbound and the outbound observer (because of the ClientCallStreamObserver callack that is necessary) that only happens on the SDK harness since there is no need to connect the inbound and outbound observers this way on the ServerCallStreamObserver.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

import operation on the FHIR API is made to handle large amounts of data, similar to a pipeline on apache beam. Starting an import operation on the FHIR API for a small amount of input is inefficient, as:\r\n- The operation will scale itself up to manage millions of resources of input, spinning up many operations (each for a small number of resources) incurs a lot of overhead costs in managing an operation.\r\n- There is a quota on the number of long-running operations on the FHIR service per project, which by default is 100. Therefore, creating 100 shards uses all this quota up in one instance of the pipeline.\r\n- It is possible to request increases for the quota, however limitations of the FHIR service mean that operations after a certain # will be unable to make progress until earlier operations complete.\r\n\r\nTherefore, sharding causes a severe loss of import performance and burdens the FHIR services. This change removing the sharding + GroupIntoBatches part of FhirIO.Import, relying on DoFns & bundle handling to partition import input into more reasonable, large batches of resources.\r\n\r\nAlso updated comments & changed the import to move files instead of copying since we already handle re-tries resulting in missing files in the source. Renamed most occurrences of \"Bundle\" to \"Batch\", to avoid confusion with FHIR bundles.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds an integration test for KinesisIO (`aws2`) using Localstack.\r\n`KinesisIOIT` in `aws2` can still be run against real Kinesis using pipeline options.\r\n\r\n- The `integrationTest` task is added to `javaPostCommit`\r\n- `kinesis`: Bump localstack container version to version used in `aws2` for better robustness (HTTP/HTTPS) and simplify test `KinesisIOIT` accordingly.\r\n- `aws`: Bump localstack container version for DynamoDBIOTest to version used in KinesisIOIT\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

current logic in `toCalciteRow` wraps an `Expression` in a `BlockStatement` for use with `BlockBuilder.append`, but this is unnecessary. Instead we can just use `BlockBuilder.add` to add the `Expression` directly. This isn't a problem currently, but in Calcite 1.27.0 our current usage will begin raising an NPE (see [CALCITE-4869](https://issues.apache.org/CALCITE-4869)).\r\n\r\n`ValidatesRunner` compliance

annotation](https://github.com/google/guava/commit/40faa2cb6a7e4aa9535b1a2a21265d533aca3eae) added to some of the Guava classes. As per the Javadoc, the annotation is targeted for Kotlin platform. (The annotation indicates the return value of generic function is not nullable iff the type in the type parameter is not nullable.)\r\n\r\nBefore the change in ApiSurface.java, the annotation was marked as unexpectedly exposed type.\r\n\r\n` ./gradlew -p sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform test --tests=GcpApiSurfaceTest` fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nExpected: API surface to include only:\r\n\tClasses in package \"com.google.api.core\"\r\n\tClasses in package \"com.google.api.client.googleapis\"\r\n\tClasses in package \"com.google.api.client.http\"\r\n...\r\nbut: The following disallowed classes appeared on the API surface:\r\n\tinterface com.google.common.base.ParametricNullness exposed via:\r\n\t\tinterface com.google.common.base.ParametricNullness\r\n\t\tinterface com.google.common.base.Function\r\n\t\tclass com.google.common.base.Optional\r\n\t\tclass com.google.cloud.bigtable.config.CallOptionsConfig\r\n\t\tclass com.google.cloud.bigtable.config.BigtableOptions\r\n\t\tclass org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.bigtable.BigtableIO$Write\r\n\t\tclass org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.bigtable.BigtableIO\r\n\tat org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:18)\r\n\tat org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat(MatcherAssert.java:6)\r\n\tat org.apache.beam.sdk.io.gcp.GcpApiSurfaceTest.testGcpApiSurface(GcpApiSurfaceTest.java:128)\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://ci-beam.apache.org/job/beam_PreCommit_Java_Commit/19434/testReport/\r\n\r\nExample usage of the annotation:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  @ParametricNullness\r\n  T get();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means that the method `get()` is nullable if type parameter `T` is nullable. It's non-null if `T` is non-null.\r\n\r\nThis ParametricNullness annotation is not intend to be used other than Guava because it's not public. It's only visible to com.google.common.base package. ApiSurfaceTest should not detect this as exposed APIs.\r\n\r\nInitially, I tried to add an exception for the annotation class in GcpApiSurfaceTest.java. However, because the annotation class is only visible in Guava's package, I couldn't add it. Instead, I went for modifying the logic of ApiSurface.java not to report non-public annotation classes. This is because non-public annotations are not visible to Beam users and thus we don't have to consider them as exposed API surfaces.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

This is a breaking change, but the transform is relatively new - and it's an easy change to handle - so I'd love to get this in.\r\n\r\nIf we don't want to introduce a breaking change, I can add API methods for `int` while using `long` internally.\r\n\r\nI'm also removing the code under `refineBounds`, because this code will not work properly (it tries to read the table bounds at pipeline construction time - but Beam pipelines run deferred in a remote environment)\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

JVM RowCoder strips trailing 0s from the null-value bitmap, while both python and go expect all bits to be present in the encoded bitmap.  This causes index-out-of-range errors when trying to decode a row encoded on the JVM in other languages in some circumstances. \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add missing trailing 0s to the null-value bitmap to avoid the index-out-of-range error for Python Coder.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

errorprone warnings listed here:\r\n\r\n**CompareToZero:** The contract for Comparator#compare and Comparable#compareTo states that the result is an integer which is < 0 for less than, == 0 for equality and > 0 for greater than. While most implementations return -1, 0 and +1 for those cases respectively, this is not guaranteed. Always comparing to 0 is the safest use of the return value.\r\n**JodaPlusMinusLong:** JodaTime’s type.plus(long) and type.minus(long) methods are often a source of bugs because the units of the parameters are ambiguous. Use type.plus(Duration.millis(long)) or type.minus(Duration.millis(long)) instead.\r\n**SameNameButDifferent:** This type name shadows another in a way that may be confusing.\r\n**UnnecessaryAnonymousClass:** Implementing a functional interface is unnecessary; prefer to implement the functional interface method directly and use a method reference instead.\r\n\r\nFor reference https://errorprone.info/bugpatterns\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
