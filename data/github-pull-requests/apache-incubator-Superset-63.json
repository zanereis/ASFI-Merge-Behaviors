SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, the `Time Grain` control defines a couple of `date truncate functions` on the `Time Column`. `Time Grain` only be applied if the `Time column` and `X-Axis` are set to the same value. This PR is the first step to removing the entire time section.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, when enabling the `GENERIC_CHART_AXES`\r\n\r\n1. `Time Grain Control` removes from `Time Section`.\r\n2. `Time Grain Control` will show if i) applies a Date Column in the `X-Axis`. ii) applies a Adhoc Column\r\n3. `Time Grain Control` will be displayed under `X-Axis`.\r\n\r\n**This change allows Time Column and Time Filter to use different columns**, Time Series Chart will support different column to set `Time Filter` and `X-Axis`, and `Time Grain` will be applied to the `X-Axis`.\r\n\r\n#### Supported Charts\r\n- Mixed Timeseries Chart\r\n- Area  Chart\r\n- Bar V2 Chart\r\n- Line V2 Chart\r\n- Scatter Chart\r\n- SmoothLine Chart\r\n- Step Chart\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n#### SQL Pattern\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1287\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/187852878-e588793d-7ed9-4744-9322-9d5ebf571c0d.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Apply `Categorical Column` or `Date Column` to the `X-Axis`\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/187853599-abc7ff9c-957a-428d-b8ff-a6f9767d7a4a.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Custom SQL\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2016594/187854928-4c566226-a8f6-4fca-9d85-bee7ba1798ec.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nIn order to test this PR, the multiple Date column should provide, so I prepare a CSV [(superstore_orders.csv)](https://github.com/apache/superset/files/9467696/superstore_orders.csv) file for that. Just load this CSV to test this PR.\r\n1. Native filters should work as before\r\n2. Time Grain should work as before\r\n3. Time Grain should apply to X-Axis\r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nCurrently updating a dataset does not update or delete any associated permissions. \r\nDataset updates impact data permission names on `table_name`, `database` and `schema`.\r\n\r\nDataset updates on the affected fields will cut user access to charts that are based on the dataset. This particularly impacts virtual datasets.\r\n\r\nAlso took the chance to refactor (split) `set_perm` to multiple SQLAlchemy events:\r\n`dataset_after_insert`\r\n`dataset_after_update`\r\n`dataset_after_delete`\r\n`database_after_insert`\r\n`database_after_update`\r\n`database_after_delete`\r\n\r\nThis makes:\r\n- Reasoning around data permissions easier\r\n- Avoids having to infer model types to take different behaviours \r\n- Makes it easier to just update permissions on certain field changes (improving performance)\r\n \r\nRelated previous fix: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20081\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\nCreating a database named `db1` with 2 datasources named: `(ds1, ds2)`, creates the following permissions:\r\n```\r\ndatabase_access -> [db1](id:1)\r\ndatasource_access -> [db1].[ds1](id:1)\r\ndatasource_access -> [db1].[ds2](id:2)\r\n```\r\nAnd a chart based on `ds1` would have `Chart.perm` field equal to `datasource_access -> [db1].[ds1](id:1)` \r\n\r\nChanging datasource name `ds1` to `ds1_changed`, would leave the permissions on the following state: \r\n\r\n```\r\ndatabase_access -> [db1](id:1)\r\ndatasource_access -> [db1].[ds1_changed](id:1)\r\ndatasource_access -> [db1].[ds2](id:2)\r\n```\r\nBut the `Chart.perm` field would be the same, so a virtual dataset name change would remove access to all related charts and dashboards to users without the all datasource permission\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR attempts to fix a bug with the series limit control when `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` feature is turned on.  Steps to reproduce bug:\r\n- Create a \"Generic Chart\"-type chart with the X-axis and a metric set.  Don't add any dimensions.  Note the number of X-values present on the chart.\r\n- Set the Series Limit to something lower than the number of X-values present on the chart and refresh.  Note how X-values are excluded.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, it looks like the SQL query builder is adding a perhaps unnecessary join against a subquery whenever Series Limit is set, regardless of if there is actually a dimension set that results in series needing limiting.  This PR attempts to make the join against the subquery only included when the frontend includes values in the `series_columns` array in the query context.\r\n\r\nUpdate: Thanks to @villebro's input, this PR now handles legacy time-series charts as before by checking the `is_timeseries` param.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n**Before:**\r\n![localhost_9000_superset_welcome_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/186045048-2e4df0a2-8261-4cd0-9f35-7b34beda902c.png)\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n![localhost_9000_superset_welcome_ (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/186045066-5e89fd0b-5348-421b-9457-9be4a1b7eded.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Confirm baseline behavior with `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` disabled:\r\n  - Create an ECharts time-series chart (e.g. ECharts > Time-series Line Chart) with 1+ metrics but no dimensions.\r\n    - The chart X-axis should contain all time values, accounting for time grain.  The \"View query\" modal should show no join present.\r\n    - Setting Series Limit to a value less than the number of time values present on the chart X-axis should have no effect, and the query should not contain a join.\r\n    - Adding a dimension then setting Series Limit to a value less than the number of dimension values should limit the number of rendered series to the series limit, and the query should now contain a join.\r\n  - The above should also hold true for a legacy, non-ECharts time-series chart (e.g. nvd3 > Line Chart).\r\n- Enable `GENERIC_CHART_AXES` and test the same:\r\n  - Create an ECharts time-series chart (e.g. ECharts > Line Chart) with 1+ metrics but no dimensions.  Set the X-axis to the time column.\r\n    - The chart X-axis should contain all time values, accounting for time grain.  The \"View query\" modal should show no join present.\r\n    - Setting Series Limit to a value less than the number of time values present on the chart X-axis should have no effect, and the query should not contain a join.\r\n    - Adding a dimension then setting Series Limit to a value less than the number of dimension values should limit the number of rendered series to the series limit, and the query should now contain a join.\r\n  - The above should also hold true for a legacy, non-ECharts time-series chart (e.g. nvd3 > Line Chart).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

SUMMARY\r\nAdds drill-to-detail context menu to World Map chart. \r\n\r\nWorld Map is a legacy plugin with some limitations like re-rendering the whole map from scratch for every property change. That's why you will notice a blinking effect when right-clicking a country or changing the color of the bubbles. Is not the objective of this PR to change this behavior. Another limitation is the possibility of keeping a country in a hovered state when interacting with the context menu. Many of these limitations can be resolved by migrating the World Map to ECharts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

and the bubbles\r\n2 - Check the value and formatted value when right-clicking\r\n3 - When the context menu is active, both labels and hovered effects are disabled for other countries\r\n\r\n###

`just-handlebar-helpers` previously used as helpers for `handlebars` requires a lot of dependencies like `moment`, etc, which need not be defined necessarily. Also, it expects some globals which are breaking on window machines. Switched to having the necessary helpers in the plugin itself.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1244\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-08-20 at 3 02 32 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31492148/185742215-65b795e1-7c79-4573-9027-ef872614c2b0.png\">\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1776\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-08-20 at 3 59 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31492148/185742225-6c78991c-8af2-4c81-8f7e-68459583da62.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nRender any chart using `plugin-chart-handlerbars` on any dataset.

SUMMARY\r\nThis bug has been accidentally introduced from #17044.\r\n\r\nSince DatabaseSelector component has an unnecessary key, DatabaseSelector will be re-mounted  rather than update whenever currentDatabase object is updated. This causes the unexpected duplicate database list api request.\r\nThis commit removes this key so will skip unnecessary re-rendering and data fetching.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n- Previously, when users execute an ad-hoc query through the SQL lab interface,\r\n   their username was not provided, and the `current_user` global was not available.\r\n   This resulted in the error described in #20455\r\n\r\n- This patch provides the `DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR` override the user executing the\r\n   ad-hoc query so that their credentials can be properly looked up.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nImplement `DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR` method to enable user impersonation when executing ad-hoc queries. Then, issue a query from the SQL-Lab page.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n- Previously, when users execute an ad-hoc query through the SQL lab interface,\r\n   their username was not provided, and the `current_user` global was not available.\r\n   This resulted in the error described in #20455 \r\n\r\n- This patch provides the `DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR` override the user executing the\r\n   ad-hoc query so that their credentials can be properly looked up.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nImplement `DB_CONNECTION_MUTATOR` method to enable user impersonation when executing ad-hoc queries. Then, issue a query from the SQL-Lab page. \r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, the **timeseries** chart has a variable `labelMap`, used for mapping result columns(or series)

Slack we (Airbnb) are experiencing performance issues with the Superset v1 API—in relation to a large dataset—due to an inefficiency in how the underlying FAB API fetch metadata. We're restricted to using the legacy FAB API however not all columns (for our needs) are exposed and thus this PR exposes the metric `extra` column to the list of columns which are included when reading/listing the metric metadata.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nRan

SUMMARY\r\nFirst version of table conditional formatter was using `rgb()` format to describe colors. Later we changed it to hex notation, which broke the existing color formatters. This PR adds a migration of old color formatters to use hex notation.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-08-16 at 16 27 48\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/184908332-0fffde67-769a-41b4-b6e5-a888728cc83f.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-08-16 at 16 25 02\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/184908276-1ecccb7a-3dff-4d9e-b953-79e486911c9e.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a table chart with conditional formatters using the old color formats (or just manually edit the form data in the database with 1 of `rgb(255,0,0)` for red, `rgb(255,255,0)` for yellow or `rgb(0,255,0)` for green.\r\n2. Run the migration\r\n3. Verify that the conditional formatters apply colors correctly. \r\n4. The conditional formatters that were already using the new color notation should remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\n\r\n**Adds the MetadataBar component**\r\n\r\nThe metadata bar component is used to display additional information about an entity. Some of the common applications in Superset are:\r\n\r\n- Display the chart’s metadata in Explore to help the user understand what dashboards this chart is added to and get to know the details of the chart\r\n- Display the database’s metadata in a drill to detail modal to help the user understand what data they are looking at while accessing the feature in the dashboard\r\n\r\nThe metadata bar is by default a static component (besides the links in text). The variations in this component are related to content and entity type as all of the details are predefined in the code and should be specific for each metadata object.\r\n\r\nContent types are predefined and consistent across the whole app. This means that they will be displayed and behave in a consistent manner, keeping the same ordering, information formatting, and interactions. For example, the Owner content type will always have the same icon and when hovered it will present who created the entity, its current owners, and when the entity was created.\r\n\r\nThe Overview page in the Storybook contains the component's documentation with the available content types and their properties.\r\n\r\n**Configures the Storybook to display MDX content**\r\n\r\nThis will allow developers to create documentation pages about each component using the whole power of [MDX](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-docs/mdx). This is one of the improvements we're working on to improve our current design system. \r\n\r\n**Configures the Storybook to read and display [JSDocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSDoc)**\r\nWith this configuration, JSDocs added to Typescript metadata will be available in the controls panel in the Storybook. This will reduce the burden when writing stories and promote well-documented components.\r\n\r\n@kasiazjc @jess-dillard @eric-briscoe \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70410625/184633200-d9c2770f-1afb-4c45-858c-0af0b54d45cd.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nAll requirements have associated RTL tests. You can interact with the component in the Storybook.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nFixes cache warmup via celery job. \r\n\r\n- adds cache and data cache configs to the docker-compose superset_config to enable caching for development env.\r\n- add authentication to the cache warmup celery beat job, using the `THUMBNAIL_SELENIUM_USER` config for auth. \r\n- use the `/superset/warm_up_cache` endpoint for warming up the cache. \r\n- run the warmup call as a single celery job instead of running all the warmups in single job. This approach should enable some parallelization of the warm up calls. A slow warmup call should also not slow down the entire process. \r\n\r\nThere is currently an [open PR](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20387) that addresses this issue, however it is using a web driver process to compute the warmup by visiting the dashboard which seems a bit process heavy. Since there is already a cache warmup endpoint that is able to handle charts and filters combos, it make more sense to use that endpoint. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n\r\n- use the docker-compose workflow\r\n- Add a celery cache warmup beat config using `top_n_strategy`, set it to run at a high interval (for eg, every minute). documented [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/5113b01031705128df2064068a0809f07019c8ae/superset/tasks/cache.py#L96)\r\n- visit dashboards to that top n strategy has data to work with\r\n- observe the cache warmup logs in the worker \r\n- visit dashboards and notice the charts are cached\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with

SUMMARY\r\nWhen importing a dashboards from another superset instance, the importer will ensure that all chart ids are remapped to the new ids. This includes id's in the dashboard metadata such as filter scopes and native filters.\r\nHowever, the remapping was not implemented for the cross filters configuration. This PR fixes that.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nUnit test have been added to existing `tests/unit_tests/dashboards/commands/importers/v1/utils_test.py`\r\n\r\nCan be tested with `tox -e py38

SUMMARY\r\nOur users are getting an `Internal Server Error 500` when trying to upload files to `GSheets` databases, that's because such databases don't support file upload nor the `Clickhouse` ones thus we need to stop showing such options to the users and prevent that existing ones get displayed in the upload form.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,  `schemas allowed` field is dependent on having file upload enabled but doesn't appear that way, so we are rendering it only when user checks the `Allow file upload` checkbox and placing it underneath the file upload checkbox.\r\n\r\nWording changes:\r\n1. Update field name to : \"Allow file uploads to database\" instead of \"Allow data upload\" and remove the tooltip\r\n2. On the Schemas Allowed field, we should update \"CSV Upload\" text to be \"File Upload\" and \"CSVs\" to \"files\", including in the hint text\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/184278578-5969753c-d5a3-4ff3-9895-130cfd51d975.gif)\r\n\r\n![error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/184930260-5d380b6a-fb6e-4cd9-b419-c11bba03878a.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/184278136-0788af68-ce22-484a-bc2f-3608517c2b80.gif)\r\n\r\n![test](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38889534/184930361-9b8230f6-9d52-47ff-aed6-8169c6825f2e.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. When selecting a DB type, if GSheet or Clickhouse is selected the `Allow data upload` checkbox is not displayed in the form\r\n2. Enabled the file upload menu only if there is any exiting DB with allow_file_upload flag set to true and that is not `GSheets` nor `Clickhouse`\r\n3. When the form to file upload files is opened, the `Database` dropdown must not contain any `GSheets` nor `Clickhouse` DB.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nAdd query cancellation functionality to Trino spec as outlined here: https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/system.html#system-connector-procedures. Since we're now extending the Presto spec which handles query cancellation implicitly, but the Trino driver doesn't, we also need to return `False` on `has_implicit_cancel`.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a unit test suite for Trino with cases for query cancellation. I'll migrate the rest of the tests from the integration tests in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nPreviously, cancelling a query on Trino would leave the query running on the database. However, after this change, when cancelling a query, the query will terminate with the following error:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/183861967-988467c2-0d4d-4829-a4b2-546e5b876182.png)\r\n\r\nOn the Trino UI we can see the following:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/183862020-ee313469-4766-4f32-aaa8-2ec27dc112bd.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Run a long running query on Trino\r\n2. Cancel the query\r\n3. Verify that the query terminates\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [

SUMMARY\r\nA stacked chart sets the total value only, the total label displays on top of the most latest non-null data index item.\r\nWhen the data contains negative values, the stack chart places the item underneath the positive item.\r\nTherefore the total value can be located within the stack bar when a negative value in the most latest index.\r\nThis commit fixes the `extractShowValueIndexes` logic by ignoring the negative values for onlyTotal option.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"497\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-08-08 at 4 17 59 PM\"

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nIt seems that these ton'g always exist in imported dashboards, which is causing trouble. Hopefully this allows imports to be upgraded to the latest code more smoothly.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nREPRO STEPS:\r\n* Roll back to a SHA earlier than https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/20743\r\n* Import a couple of dashboards\r\n* Update Superset to the above SHA (or newer)\r\n* Open imported dashboard(s) in workspace\r\n* See the error blocking dashboard loading\r\n\r\nThe above should work without error with this fix, if I'm lucky.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes the final test in `SaveDatasetModal.test.tsx`. Initially the test for the overwrite screen buttons had to be squashed into the previous test because creating another test after this test would always render incorrectly and fail. The problem was that timers used by the component were being fired after the test ran. The solution was to use `jest.useFakeTimers()` at the top of the file, so that the timers run in the test environment. I also completed testing on the overwrite screen and cleaned up some arbitrary `act` wrappers.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- In your terminal, cd into `superset-frontend`\r\n- Run the command `npm run test superset-frontend/src/SqlLab/components/SaveDatasetModal/SaveDatasetModal.test.tsx`\r\n- Observe that all tests pass with no act errors\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant
