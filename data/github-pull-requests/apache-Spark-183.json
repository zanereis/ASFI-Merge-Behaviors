The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

Howerver, `FetchShuffleBlocks` read shuffle blocks order is not the same as `blockIds` in `OneForOneBlockFetcher`; the `blockIds` is used to match blockId with shuffle data with index, now it is out of order;\r\nIt will lead to read wrong block chunk when some blocks fetch failed in `OneForOneBlockFetcher`, it will retry the rest of the blocks in `blockIds`  based on the `blockIds`'s order.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis adds `hadoop-yarn-server-web-proxy` as dependency for Yarn and Hadoop 3.x profile (it is already a dependency for 2.x). Also excludes some dependencies from the module which are already covered by other Hadoop jars used by Spark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe class `org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.webproxy.amfilter.AmIpFilter` is used by `ApplicationMaster`:\r\n```scala\r\n  private def addAmIpFilter(driver: Option[RpcEndpointRef], proxyBase: String) = {\r\n    val amFilter = \"org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.webproxy.amfilter.AmIpFilter\"\r\n    val params = client.getAmIpFilterParams(yarnConf, proxyBase)\r\n    driver match {\r\n      case Some(d) =>\r\n        d.send(AddWebUIFilter(amFilter, params, proxyBase))\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\nand will be loaded at runtime. Therefore, without the above jar Spark Yarn app will fail with `ClassNotFoundError`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests. Also tested manually and it worked with the fix, while was failing

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI discovered from review discussion - https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31630#discussion_r581774000 , that we can eliminate LEFT ANTI join (with no join condition) to empty relation, if the right side is known to be non-empty. So with AQE, this is doable similar to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29484 .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis can help eliminate the join operator during logical plan optimization.\r\nBefore this PR, [left side physical plan `execute()` will be called](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/joins/BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec.scala#L192), so if left side is complicated (e.g. contain broadcast exchange operator), then some computation would happen. However after this PR, the join operator will be removed during logical plan, and nothing will be computed from left side. Potentially it can save resource for these kinds of query.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests for positive and negative queries in `AdaptiveQueryExecSuite.scala`.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe endpoints of Prometheus metrics are properly marked and documented as an experimental (SPARK-31674). The class `PrometheusServlet` itself is not the part of an API so this PR proposes to remove it.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid marking a non-API as an API.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the class is already `private[spark]`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover.","created_at":"2021-02-25T00:05:25Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T00:54:57Z","closed_at":"2021-02-25T02:11:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ee6eefdcc08f3784b21d000f5127a48066d759c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31640/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31640/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31640/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/923a71d36c2a7c9bf2e2605b6856a7abc2c0e03d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-34531","ref":"SPARK-34531","sha":"923a71d36c2a7c9bf2e2605b6856a7abc2c0e03d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn a shared environnement where Hive Tez and Spark shared the same metastore and data and where Spark is connecting to the metastore of Hive Tez. I found a bug because Hive Tez allow you to change the order inside a struct that spark do not allow you.\r\n\r\nIn Hive Tez : \r\n1) You create a table with a struct:\r\n CREATE table test_struct (id int, sub STRUCT <a :INT, b:STRING>);\r\n2) You insert data into it :\r\nINSERT INTO TABLE test_struct select 1, named_struct(\"a\",1,\"b\",\"v1\");\r\n3) Create a view on top of it :\r\nCREATE view test_view_struct as select id, sub from test_view_struct\r\n\r\nYou try to access it in spark, you can access both.\r\n\r\nIn Hive Tez : \r\n4) Change the table struct reodoring the struct\r\nALTER TABLE test_struct CHANGE COLUMN sub sub STRUCT < b:STRING,a :INT>;\r\nHive Tez can query the table and the view.\r\n\r\nSpark can query the table but when spark query the view spark have a cast issue because spark will try to cast a STRUCT < b:STRING,a :INT> in a struct<a :INT, b:STRING>\r\nAnd if the modification it's castable you can even have a silent failed the data of column a are in column b and vice versa.\r\n\r\nSo I proposed to instead of resolving the struct directly during the resolution of the view, i use explicit named during the select.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt safer to resolve by name the view and it's affected the ability to spark to be used in a shared environnement and to be integrated in a eco system where Hive it's predominant.\r\nThe silent failed it's also really dangerous because the dev can miss it so you will have at the end the wrong information in the column.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT added.\r\nI also have to change a test because duplicate named in a struct are not allowed in hive.\r\nTest on a shared Hive Tez and Spark environnement with an external metastore for spark\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-24T21:20:39Z","updated_at":"2021-06-18T00:07:28Z","closed_at":"2021-06-18T00:07:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"12f41ccce02aa1eb83605a32a10a9e042f187a85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31639/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31639/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31639/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a458128a4089a381ca2c9a7339cfd99e635c66e8","head":{"label":"ubisoft:fixStructView","ref":"fixStructView","sha":"a458128a4089a381ca2c9a7339cfd99e635c66e8","user":{"login":"ubisoft","id":30477886,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwNDc3ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30477886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft","html_url":"https://github.com/ubisoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":341544688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDE1NDQ2ODg=","name":"spark","full_name":"ubisoft/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ubisoft","id":30477886,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjMwNDc3ODg2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30477886?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft","html_url":"https://github.com/ubisoft","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ubisoft/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ubisoft/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR simplifies the resolution of v2 partition commands:\r\n1. Add a common trait for v2 partition commands, so that we don't need to match them one by one in the rules.\r\n2. Make partition spec an expression, so that it's easier to resolve them via tree node transformation.\r\n3. Add `TruncatePartition` so that `TruncateTable` doesn't need to be a v2 partition command.\r\n4. Simplify `CheckAnalysis` to only check if the table is partitioned. For partitioned tables, partition spec is always resolved, so we don't need to check it. The `SupportsAtomicPartitionManagement` check is also done in the runtime. Since Spark eagerly executes commands, exception in runtime will also be thrown at analysis time.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\ncode cleanup\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is kind of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24033 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30945.\r\nMany of references in `SecurityManager` were introduced from SPARK-1189, and related usages were removed later from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/24033 and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/30945.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRename the execution node `AlterTableRecoverPartitionsCommand` for the commands:\r\n- `MSCK REPAIR TABLE table [{ADD|DROP|SYNC} PARTITIONS]`\r\n- `ALTER TABLE table RECOVER PARTITIONS`\r\n\r\nto `RepairTableCommand`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. After the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31499, `ALTER TABLE table RECOVER PARTITIONS` is equal to `MSCK REPAIR TABLE table ADD PARTITIONS`. And mapping of the generic command `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` to the more specific execution node `AlterTableRecoverPartitionsCommand` can confuse devs in the future.\r\n2. `ALTER TABLE table RECOVER PARTITIONS` does not support any options/extensions. So, additional parameters `enableAddPartitions` and `enableDropPartitions` in `AlterTableRecoverPartitionsCommand` confuse as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo because this is internal API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI found out during code review of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31567#discussion_r577379572, where we can push down limit to the left side of LEFT SEMI and LEFT ANTI join, if the join condition is empty.\r\n\r\nWhy it's safe to push down limit:\r\n\r\nThe semantics of LEFT SEMI join without condition:\r\n(1). if right side is non-empty, output all rows from left side.\r\n(2). if right side is empty, output nothing.\r\n\r\nThe semantics of LEFT ANTI join without condition:\r\n(1). if right side is non-empty, output nothing.\r\n(2). if right side is empty, output all rows from left side.\r\n\r\nWith the semantics of output all rows from left side or nothing (all or nothing), it's safe to push down limit to left side.\r\nNOTE: LEFT SEMI / LEFT ANTI join with non-empty condition is not safe for limit push down, because output can be a portion of left side rows.\r\n\r\nReference: physical operator implementation for LEFT SEMI / LEFT ANTI join without condition - https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/joins/BroadcastNestedLoopJoinExec.scala#L200-L204 .\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBetter performance. Save CPU and IO for these joins, as limit being pushed down before join.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit test in `LimitPushdownSuite.scala` and `SQLQuerySuite.scala`.","created_at":"2021-02-24T03:34:32Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T12:24:08Z","closed_at":"2021-02-24T10:23:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d96f668b2bfb02db3d0c8026958a26f47e4d65ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/22bfd5e13ffb5b51a6a29851161146a1af6a5666","head":{"label":"c21:limit-pushdown","ref":"limit-pushdown","sha":"22bfd5e13ffb5b51a6a29851161146a1af6a5666","user":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159474643,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTk0NzQ2NDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"c21/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"c21","id":4629931,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2Mjk5MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4629931?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21","html_url":"https://github.com/c21","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/c21/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/c21/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-33084 added the ability to use ivy coordinates with `SparkContext.addJar`. PR #29966 claims to mimic Hive behavior although I found a few cases where it doesn't\r\n\r\n1) The default value of the transitive parameter is false, both in case of parameter not being specified in coordinate or parameter value being invalid. The Hive behavior is that transitive is [true if not specified](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/cb2ac3dcc6af276c6f64ee00f034f082fe75222b/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/util/DependencyResolver.java#L169) in the coordinate and [false for invalid values](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/cb2ac3dcc6af276c6f64ee00f034f082fe75222b/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/util/DependencyResolver.java#L124). Also, regardless of Hive, I think a default of true for the transitive parameter also matches [ivy's own defaults](https://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/2.5.0/ivyfile/dependency.html#_attributes).\r\n\r\n2) The parameter value for transitive parameter is regarded as case-sensitive [based on the understanding](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/29966#discussion_r547752259) that Hive behavior is case-sensitive. However, this is not correct, Hive [treats the parameter value case-insensitively](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/cb2ac3dcc6af276c6f64ee00f034f082fe75222b/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/util/DependencyResolver.java#L122).\r\n\r\nI propose that we be compatible with Hive for these behaviors\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make `ADD JAR` with ivy coordinates compatible with Hive's transitive behavior\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe user-facing changes here are within master as the feature introduced in SPARK-33084 has not been released yet\r\n1. Previously an ivy coordinate without `transitive` parameter specified did not resolve transitive dependency, now it does.\r\n2. Previously an `transitive` parameter value was treated case-sensitively. e.g. `transitive=TRUE` would be treated as false as it did not match exactly `true`. Now it will be treated case-insensitively.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome of the built-in JDBC connection providers are changing the JVM security context to do the authentication which is fine. The problematic part is that executors can be reused by another query. The following situation leads to incorrect behaviour:\r\n* Query1 opens JDBC connection and changes JVM security context in Executor1\r\n* Query2 tries to open JDBC connection but it realizes there is already an entry for that DB type in Executor1\r\n* Query2 is not changing JVM security context and uses Query1 keytab and principal\r\n* Query2 fails with authentication error\r\n\r\nIn this PR I've changed to code such a way that JVM security context is changed all the time but only temporarily until the connection built-up and then rolled back. Since `getConnection` is synchronised with `SecurityConfigurationLock` it ends-up in correct behaviour without any race.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIncorrect JVM security context handling.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting unit + integration

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup of #31560,  \r\nIn  #31560,  we added `JavaSimpleWritableDataSource ` and left some little problems like unused interface `SessionConfigSupport` 、 inconsistent schema between `JavaSimpleWritableDataSource ` and `SimpleWritableDataSource`.\r\nThis PR fixes the remaining problems in #31560.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. `SessionConfigSupport` in `JavaSimpleWritableDataSource ` and `SimpleWritableDataSource` is never used, so we don't need to implement it.\r\n2. change the schema of `SimpleWritableDataSource`, to match `TestingV2Source`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nApache Spark 3.0 introduced `spark.eventLog.compression.codec` configuration.\r\nFor Apache Spark 3.2, this PR aims to set `zstd` as the default value for `spark.eventLog.compression.codec` configuration.\r\nThis only affects creating a new log file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of event logs is archiving. Many logs are generated and occupy the storage, but most of them are never accessed by users.\r\n\r\n**1. Save storage resources (and money)**\r\n\r\nIn general, ZSTD is much smaller than LZ4.\r\nFor example, in case of TPCDS (Scale 200) log, ZSTD generates about 3 times smaller log files than LZ4.\r\n\r\n| CODEC | SIZE (bytes) |\r\n|---------|-------------|\r\n| LZ4         | 184001434|\r\n| ZSTD      |  64522396|\r\n\r\nAnd, the plain file is 17.6 times bigger.\r\n```\r\n-rw-r--r--    1 dongjoon  staff  1135464691 Feb 21 22:31 spark-a1843ead29834f46b1125a03eca32679\r\n-rw-r--r--    1 dongjoon  staff    64522396 Feb 21 22:31 spark-a1843ead29834f46b1125a03eca32679.zstd\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2. Better Usability**\r\n\r\nWe cannot decompress Spark-generated LZ4 event log files via CLI while we can for ZSTD event log files. Spark's LZ4 event log files are inconvenient to some users who want to uncompress and access them.\r\n```\r\n$ lz4 -d spark-d3deba027bd34435ba849e14fc2c42ef.lz4\r\nDecoding file spark-d3deba027bd34435ba849e14fc2c42ef\r\nError 44 : Unrecognized header : file cannot be decoded\r\n```\r\n```\r\n$ zstd -d spark-a1843ead29834f46b1125a03eca32679.zstd\r\nspark-a1843ead29834f46b1125a03eca32679.zstd: 1135464691 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\n**3. Speed**\r\nThe following results are collected by running [lzbench](https://github.com/inikep/lzbench) on the above Spark event log. Note that\r\n- This is not a direct comparison of Spark compression/decompression codec.\r\n- `lzbench` is an in-memory benchmark. So, it doesn't show the benefit of the reduced network traffic due to the small size of ZSTD.\r\n\r\nHere,\r\n- To get ZSTD 1.4.8-1 result, `lzbench` `master` branch is used because Spark is using ZSTD 1.4.8.\r\n- To get LZ4 1.7.5 result, `lzbench` `v1.7` branch is used because Spark is using LZ4 1.7.1.\r\n```\r\nCompressor name      Compress.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to extend Catalyst's type system by two new types that conform to the SQL standard (see SQL:2016, section 4.6.3):\r\n- `DayTimeIntervalType` represents the day-time interval type,\r\n- `YearMonthIntervalType` for SQL year-month interval type.\r\n\r\nThis PR only adds the two new DataType implementations, and there will be more PRs as sub-tasks of SPARK-27790 to completely support the new ANSI interval types.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark as it is today supports an INTERVAL datatype. However this type is of very limited use. Existing interval values cannot be compared with any other interval values, or persisted to storage. Spark users request to either implement new or expand existing built-in functions which produce some sort of measures for elapsed time, such as `DATEDIFF()`. Rather than work around the edges to fill the potholes of the existing INTERVAL data type, I would like to propose to deliver a proper ANSI compliant INTERVAL type that can be introduced with minimal incompatibility, is comparable and thus sortable, and can be persisted in tables.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By checking coding style via:\r\n```\r\n$ ./dev/scalastyle\r\n$ ./dev/lint-java\r\n```\r\n2. Run the test for the default sizes:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *DataTypeSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-02-22T17:48:58Z","updated_at":"2021-03-03T04:44:35Z","closed_at":"2021-03-03T04:44:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3583cc7a9f287b0071dbb4adf336f5f0bfa680c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c72a455b4a741bfa57b66a8cd15df6029ed34b21","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:day-time-interval-type","ref":"day-time-interval-type","sha":"c72a455b4a741bfa57b66a8cd15df6029ed34b21","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe current expression dsl API heavily relies on Symbol, which is deprecated in Scala 3. However, the string support in the expression dsl API is pretty weak.\r\n\r\nThis PR improves the dsl API to let `\"name\".int` return an int attribute, which is the same as `'name.int`. The same to other types.\r\n\r\nTo do this, this PR removes the string literal implicit, which is not widely used, and adds a new string implicit that creates attributes, which is the same as the symbol implicit. As a consequence, `\"abc\" like ...` now creates a Like expression with attribute `abc`, not string literal \"abc\". To use literal, this PR adds a new way: `\"abc\".lit like ...`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo slowly retire Symbol.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nComment out `DslString` and compile, and see which places rely on string implicits. Also check failed tests.\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor a specific stage, it is useful to show the task metrics in percentile distribution.  This information can help users know whether or not there is a skew/bottleneck among tasks in a given stage.  We list an example in taskMetricsDistributions.json\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it is useful to show the executor metrics in percentile distribution for a specific stage. This information can show whether or not there is a skewed load on some executors.  We list an example in executorMetricsDistributions.json\r\n\r\nWe define `withSummaries` and `quantiles` query parameter in the REST API for a specific stage as:\r\n\r\napplications/<application_id>/<application_attempt/stages/<stage_id>/<stage_attempt>?withSummaries=[true|false]& quantiles=0.05,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.95\r\n\r\n1. withSummaries: default is false, define whether to show current stage's taskMetricsDistribution and executorMetricsDistribution\r\n2. quantiles: default is `0.0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0` only effect when `withSummaries=true`, it define the quantiles we use when calculating metrics distributions.\r\n\r\nWhen withSummaries=true, both task metrics in percentile distribution and executor metrics in percentile distribution are included in the REST API output.  The default value of withSummaries is false, i.e. no metrics percentile distribution will be included in the REST API output.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor a specific stage, it is useful to show the task metrics in percentile distribution.  This information can help users

change?\r\nUser can  use  below restful API to get task metrics distribution and executor metrics distribution for indivial stage\r\n```\r\napplications/<application_id>/<application_attempt/stages/<stage_id>/<stage_attempt>?withSummaries=[true|false]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen resolving a view, we use the captured view name in `AnalysisContext` to\r\ndistinguish whether a relation name is a view or a table. But if the resolution failed,\r\nother rules (e.g. `ResolveTables`) will try to resolve the relation again but without\r\n`AnalysisContext`. So, in this case, the resolution may be incorrect. For example,\r\nif the view refers to a dropped table while a view with the same name exists, the\r\ndropped table will be resolved as a view rather than an unresolved exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nbugfix\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nno\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nnewly added test

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nWith the Catalyst DSL (`dsl/package.scala`), we have two ways to represent attributes.\r\n\r\n1. Symbol literals (`'` syntax)\r\n2. `$\"\"` syntax which is defined in `sql/catalyst` module using string context.\r\n\r\nBut they have problems.\r\n\r\nRegarding symbol literals, the scala community deprecates the symbol literals in Scala 2.13. We could alternatively use `Symbol` constructor but what is worse, Scala will completely remove `Symbol` in the future (https://scalacenter.github.io/scala-3-migration-guide/docs/incompatibilities/dropped-features.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n> Although scala.Symbol is useful for migration, beware that it is deprecated and that it will be removed from the scala-library. You are recommended, as a second step, to replace them with plain string literals \"xwy\" or a dedicated class.\r\n\r\nRegarding `$\"\"` syntax, this has two problems.\r\nThe first problem is that the syntax conflicts with another `$\"\"` syntax defined in `sql/core` module.\r\nYou can easily see the problem with the Spark Shell.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.dsl.expressions._\r\nval attr1 = $\"attr1\"\r\n\r\n       error: type mismatch;\r\n        found   : StringContext\r\n        required: ?{def $: ?}\r\n       Note that implicit conversions are not applicable because they are ambiguous:\r\n        both method StringToColumn in class SQLImplicits of type (sc: StringContext): spark.implicits.StringToColumn\r\n        and method StringToAttributeConversionHelper in trait ExpressionConversions of type (sc: StringContext): org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.dsl.expressions.StringToAttributeConversionHelper\r\n        are possible conversion functions from StringContext to ?{def $: ?}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second problem is that we can't write like `$\"attr\".map(StringType, StringType)`, though we can write `'attr.map(StringType, StringType)`.\r\nThis seems to be a bug of the Scala compiler and will be fixed in neither `2.12` nor `2.13` (https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/7396).\r\n\r\nActually, I'm working on replacing all the symbol literals with `$\"\"` syntax in SPARK-34443 (#31569) and I found this problem in the following test code.\r\n\r\n* EncoderResolutionSuite.scala\r\n* ComplexTypeSuite.scala\r\n* ObjectExpressionsSuite.scala\r\n* NestedColumnAliasingSuite.scala\r\n* ReplaceNullWithFalseInPredicateSuite.scala\r\n* SimplifyCastsSuite.scala\r\n* SimplifyConditionalSuite.scala\r\n\r\n```\r\n[error] /home/kou/work/oss/spark-scala-2.13/sql/catalyst/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/encoders/EncoderResolutionSuite.scala:212:28: too many arguments (found 2, expected 1) for method map: (f: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Expression => A): Seq[A]\r\n[error]       $\"a\".map(StringType, StringType)).foreach { attr =>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a solution for those problems, I propose to rename `map` to `mapAttr`.\r\nWith this solution, we can write `\"name\".attr.mapAttr` rather than `$\"name\".map` or `'name.map`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo. `dsl/package.scala` is for internal use.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSet the active SparkSession to `sparkSessionForStream` and diable AQE & CBO before initializing the `StreamExecution.logicalPlan`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe active session should be `sparkSessionForStream`. Otherwise, settings like\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6b34745cb9b294c91cd126c2ea44c039ee83cb84/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/StreamExecution.scala#L332-L335\r\n\r\nwouldn't take effect if callers access them from the active SQLConf, e.g., the rule of `InsertAdaptiveSparkPlan`. Besides, unlike `InsertAdaptiveSparkPlan` (which skips streaming plan), `CostBasedJoinReorder` seems to have the chance to take effect theoretically.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested manually. Before the fix, `InsertAdaptiveSparkPlan` would try to apply AQE on the plan(wouldn't take effect though). After this fix, the rule returns directly.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-20T08:52:29Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T05:26:22Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T14:41:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba300ea706fec68418d05cfdf589736a4e8b0455","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome user who not so clear about spark when build SparkSession\r\n```\r\nSparkSession.builder().config()\r\n```\r\nIn this method user may config `spark.driver.memory` then he will think when submit job, spark driver's memory is change. But when we run this code, JVM has been  started,  so this configuration won't work at all.  And in Spark UI, it will show `spark.driver.memory` as this configuration set by `SparkSession.builder().config()`. This makes user and administer confuse.\r\nSo we should ignore such as wrong way and logWarn.\r\n\r\nAfter this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to rename logical nodes of v2 commands in the form: `<verb> + <object>` like:\r\n- AlterTableAddPartition -> AddPartition\r\n- AlterTableSetLocation -> SetTableLocation\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. For simplicity and readability of logical plans\r\n2. For consistency with other logical nodes. For example, the logical node `RenameTable` for `ALTER TABLE .. RENAME TO` was added before `AlterTableRenamePartition`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not since this is non-public APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Check scala style: `./dev/scalastyle`\r\n2. Affected test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *AlterTableRenamePartitionSuite\"\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-19T20:07:30Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T12:05:09Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T12:05:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6c1529784eb064ecfcecf6b3aafcb03e9a5aac78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f6ab9ab4c127723a24066c559e0389b0a48bf1f2","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:rename-alter-table-logic-nodes","ref":"rename-alter-table-logic-nodes","sha":"f6ab9ab4c127723a24066c559e0389b0a48bf1f2","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIf new table name consists of single part (no namespaces), the v2 `ALTER TABLE .. RENAME TO` command renames the table while keeping it in the same namespace. For example:\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE catalog_name.ns1.ns2.ns3.ns4.ns5.tbl RENAME TO new_table\r\n```\r\nthe command should rename the source table to `catalog_name.ns1.ns2.ns3.ns4.ns5.new_table`.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis fixes a regression in `DataFrameReader.schema(StructType)`, to avoid NPE if the given `StructType` is null. Note that, passing null to Spark public APIs leads to undefined behavior. There is no document mentioning the null behavior, and it's just an accident that `DataFrameReader.schema(StructType)` worked before. So I think this is not a 3.1 blocker.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt fixes a 3.1 regression\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyea, now `df.read.schema(null: StructType)` is a noop as before, while in the current branch-3.1 it throws NPE.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nIt's undefined behavior and is very obvious, so I didn't add a test. We should add tests when we clearly define and fix the null behavior for all public APIs.","created_at":"2021-02-19T14:35:12Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T18:10:57Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T13:11:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6eaf19e203e1d1d265cf1b1b4cc70ced542bc7c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn YARN, ship the `spark.jars.ivySettings` file to the driver when using `cluster` deploy mode so that `addJar` is able to find it in order to resolve ivy paths.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nSPARK-33084 introduced support for Ivy paths in `sc.addJar` or Spark SQL `ADD JAR`. If we use a custom ivySettings file using `spark.jars.ivySettings`, it is loaded at https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b26e7b510bbaee63c4095ab47e75ff2a70e377d7/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/SparkSubmit.scala#L1280. However, this file is only accessible on the client machine. In YARN cluster mode, this file is not available on the driver and so `addJar` fails to find it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nAdded unit tests to verify that the `ivySettings` file is localized by the YARN client and that a YARN cluster mode application is able to find to load the `ivySettings` file.","created_at":"2021-02-19T11:16:58Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T02:25:53Z","closed_at":"2021-04-20T18:36:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ff2d3aa39205f524bb58d899f362ee901270762","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1427970157,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDI3OTcwMTU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/YARN","name":"YARN","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fd3ddb2bd60fd34e605479eb07c2d7021f3c44e0","head":{"label":"shardulm94:SPARK-34472","ref":"SPARK-34472","sha":"fd3ddb2bd60fd34e605479eb07c2d7021f3c44e0","user":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":304161240,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQxNjEyNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"shardulm94/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModify `RandomDataGenerator.forType()` to allow generation of dates/timestamps that are valid in both Julian and Proleptic Gregorian calendars. Currently, the function can produce a date (for example `1582-10-06`) which is valid in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. Though it cannot be saved to ORC files AS IS since ORC format (ORC libs in fact) assumes Julian calendar. So, Spark shifts `1582-10-06` to the next valid date `1582-10-15` while saving it to ORC files. And as a consequence of that, the test fails because it compares original date `1582-10-06` and the date `1582-10-15` loaded back from the ORC files.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose to generate valid dates/timestamps in both calendars for ORC datasource till SPARK-34440 is resolved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix failures of `HiveOrcHadoopFsRelationSuite`. For instance, the test \"test all data types\" fails with the seed **610710213676**:\r\n```\r\n== Results ==\r\n!== Correct Answer - 20 ==    == Spark Answer - 20 ==\r\n struct<index:int,col:date>

tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly *HiveOrcHadoopFsRelationSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a default null ordering to public `SortDirection` to match the Catalyst behavior.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThe SQL standard does not define the default null ordering for a sort direction. That's why it is up to a query engine to assign one. We need to standardize this in our public connector expressions to avoid ambiguity. That's why I propose to match the behavior in our Catalyst expressions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, it affects unreleased connector expression API.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.","created_at":"2021-02-17T21:46:06Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T05:55:56Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T05:47:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb772e420b43e3199fb6c26f7ae745f576357eeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31580/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31580/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31580/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9bff6851b6e905985560fd06460059de6c96b05b","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-34457","ref":"spark-34457","sha":"9bff6851b6e905985560fd06460059de6c96b05b","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Make the following SQL configs as internal:\r\n    - spark.sql.legacy.allowHashOnMapType\r\n    - spark.sql.legacy.sessionInitWithConfigDefaults\r\n2. Add a test to check that all SQL configs from the `legacy` namespace are marked as internal configs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAssuming that legacy SQL configs shouldn't be set by users in common cases. The purpose of such configs is to allow switching to old behavior in corner cases. So, the configs should be marked as internals. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *SQLConfSuite\"\r\n```\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-17T17:45:09Z","updated_at":"2021-02-18T18:40:04Z","closed_at":"2021-02-18T18:40:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1220649804d82ed45f54bd038f03cd56ca8c2d52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31577/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31577/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31577/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84aed2f9a55160fe5906be7d716129db46811ef4","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:mark-legacy-configs-as-internal","ref":"mark-legacy-configs-as-internal","sha":"84aed2f9a55160fe5906be7d716129db46811ef4","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMove the datetime rebase SQL configs from the `legacy` namespace by:\r\n1. Renaming of the existing rebase configs like `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead` -> `spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead`.\r\n2. Add the legacy configs as alternatives\r\n3. Deprecate the legacy rebase configs. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe rebasing SQL configs like `spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead` can be used not only for migration from previous Spark versions but also to read/write datatime columns saved by other systems/frameworks/libs. So, the configs shouldn't be considered as legacy configs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nShould not. Users will see a warning if they still use one of the legacy configs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. Manually checking new configs:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead\")\r\nres0: String = EXCEPTION\r\n\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead\", \"LEGACY\")\r\n21/02/17 14:57:10 WARN SQLConf: The SQL config 'spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead' has been deprecated in Spark v3.2 and may be removed in the future. Use 'spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead' instead.\r\n\r\nscala> spark.conf.get(\"spark.sql.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead\")\r\nres2: String = LEGACY\r\n```\r\n2. By running a datetime rebasing test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetRebaseDatetimeV1Suite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2021-02-17T12:17:27Z","updated_at":"2021-02-17T17:57:08Z","closed_at":"2021-02-17T14:05:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"978071932b90c7542b97c3869b68f7d4d99e1d4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRemove `.internal()` from the SQL legacy config `spark.sql.legacy.replaceDatabricksSparkAvro.enabled`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIn fact, the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.replaceDatabricksSparkAvro.enabled` has been already documented publicly, see http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-avro.html. So, it cannot be considered as an internal config.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis updates the list of auto generated SQL configs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy generating docs:\r\n```\r\n$ ./sql/create-docs.sh\r\n$ cd docs\r\n$ SKIP_API=1 SKIP_SCALADOC=1 SKIP_PYTHONDOC=1 SKIP_RDOC=1 jekyll serve

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2.

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to add session window feature to Structured Streaming.\r\n\r\nThe code is based on previous PR #22583. Credits to original authors and they should be listed as major authors in the commit.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n* Remove unnecessary partial aggregation.\r\n* Configurable state store format: in case we want to use different state format for session window in the next releases. We should let it configurable like aggregation. Current the format config value is 1.\r\n* Replace state store format: session windows per key are not stored as a long array anymore. Instead, we store states to two state stores, one for key -> list of start time, and one for (key, start time) -> state value.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSupport session window feature in Structure Streaming. This feature is well-known one in streaming processing. Based on previous discussion and new customer requirement, it seems to be a solid reason to have this in Spark.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users may be able to use session window feature in Structure Streaming.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit test currently. We may put it to staging test internally.","created_at":"2021-02-16T03:51:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:27:43Z","closed_at":"2021-07-13T17:08:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"495e56817f18d99e4f5a5155baa6159667ffbdf9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nUse `LookupCatalog.AsTableIdentifier` in `ResolveSessionCatalog` to recognize `spark_catalog` and cut it off from new table/view identifier before passing it to `AlterTableRenameCommand`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. Other v1 commands recognize `spark_catalog` in table names. The table renaming command should recognize it for consistency.\r\n2. To be able to write unified tests for the v1 and v2 table renaming command.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> CREATE TABLE spark_catalog.db.tbl (c0 INT) USING parquet;\r\nspark-sql> INSERT INTO spark_catalog.db.tbl SELECT 0;\r\nspark-sql> SELECT * FROM spark_catalog.db.tbl;\r\n0\r\nspark-sql> ALTER TABLE

fixes https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-34438\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThanks for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis changes `spark-submit` to accept URIs which have their path component ending in `.py` as py-spark drivers. This is important to work for example with pre-signed URIs from AWS S3.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to see that a regular URI does not work as expected, i.e. `http://my-web-server/driver.py` works as expected, but `http://my-web-server/driver.py?some-query` does not (spark will try to download the latter as a JAR).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, as it makes `spark-submit` accept a wider range of inputs as Python or R drivers (the correct range).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWe're building our own spark distribution and are using it in

After the changes, the error message is:\r\n\r\n_org.apache.spark.SparkUpgradeException: You may get a different result due to the upgrading of Spark 3.0: reading dates before 1582-10-15 or timestamps before 1900-01-01T00:00:00Z from Parquet files can be ambiguous, as the files may be written by Spark 2.x or legacy versions of Hive, which uses a legacy hybrid calendar that is different from Spark 3.0+'s Proleptic Gregorian calendar. See more details in SPARK-31404. You can set the SQL config 'spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead' or the datasource option 'datetimeRebaseMode' to 'LEGACY' to rebase the datetime values w.r.t. the calendar difference during reading. To read the datetime values as it is, set the SQL config 'spark.sql.legacy.parquet.datetimeRebaseModeInRead' or the datasource option 'datetimeRebaseMode' to 'CORRECTED'._\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. By checking coding style: `./dev/scalastyle`\r\n2. By running the related test suite:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 -Phive-thriftserver \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new protected method in `SparkFunSuite` which is only called when the test failed and can be used to collect logs for failed test. By this PR it is implemented in the Kubernetes tests by `KubernetesSuite` class where it collects all the POD logs and logs them out.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunately cannot be realized with a simple \"after\" method as in the \"after\" method the test outcome is not available.\r\n\r\nMoreover this PR removes the `appLocator` as a method argument as `appLocator` is available as a member variable.  \r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently both the driver and executors logs are lost.\r\n\r\nIn [developer-tools](https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html) there is a hint:\r\n\"Getting logs from the pods and containers directly is an exercise left to the reader.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the test is executed by Jenkins and a failure happened we really need the POD logs to analyze problem.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBy integration testing. I have checked what would happen if one test fails, the output would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n21/02/14 11:05:34.261 ScalaTest-main-running-KubernetesSuite INFO KubernetesSuite: \r\n\r\n===== EXTRA LOGS FOR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImproving the documentation and release process by pinning Jekyll version by Gemfile and Bundler.\r\n\r\nSome files and their responsibilities within this PR:\r\n- `docs/.bundle/config` is used to specify a directory \"docs/.local_ruby_bundle\" which will be used as destination to install the ruby packages into instead of the global one which requires root access\r\n- `docs/Gemfile` is specifying the required Jekyll version and other top level gem versions\r\n- `docs/Gemfile.lock` is generated by the \"bundle install\". This file contains the exact resolved versions of all the gems including the top level gems and all the direct and transitive dependencies of those gems. When this file is generated it contains a platform related section \"PLATFORMS\" (in my case after the generation it was \"universal-darwin-19\"). Still this file must be under version control as when the version of a gem does not fit to the one specified in `Gemfile` an error comes (i.e. if the `Gemfile.lock` was generated for Jekyll 4.1.0 and its version is updated in the `Gemfile` to 4.2.0 then it triggers the error: \"The bundle currently has jekyll locked at 4.1.0.\"). This is solution is also suggested officially in [its documentation](https://bundler.io/rationale.html#checking-your-code-into-version-control). To get rid of the specific platform (like \"universal-darwin-19\") first we have to add \"ruby\" as platform [which means this should work on every platform where Ruby runs](https://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/)) by running \"bundle lock --add-platform ruby\" then the specific platform can be removed by \"bundle lock --remove-platform universal-darwin-19\".\r\n\r\nAfter this the correct process to update Jekyll version is the following:\r\n1. update the version in `Gemfile`\r\n2. run \"bundle update\" which updates the `Gemfile.lock`\r\n3. commit both files\r\n\r\nThis process for version update is tested for details please check the testing section.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nUsing different Jekyll versions can generate different output documents. \r\nThis PR standardize the process.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, assuming the release was done via docker by using `do-release-docker.sh`.\r\nIn that case  there should be no difference at all as the same Jekyll version is specified in the Gemfile.  \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n#### Testing document generation \r\n\r\nDoc generation step was triggered via  the docker release:\r\n \r\n```\r\n$ ./do-release-docker.sh -d ~/working -n -s docs\r\n...\r\n========================\r\n= Building documentation...\r\nCommand: /opt/spark-rm/release-build.sh docs\r\nLog file: docs.log\r\nSkipping publish step.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe docs.log

edited Gemfile to use version 4.1.0 \r\n$ cat Gemfile\r\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\ngem \"jekyll\", \"4.1.0\"\r\ngem \"rouge\", \"3.26.0\"\r\ngem \"jekyll-redirect-from\", \"0.16.0\"\r\ngem \"webrick\", \"1.7\"\r\n$ bundle install\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting Jekyll version before the update:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle exec jekyll --version\r\njekyll 4.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nImitating Jekyll update coming from git by reverting my local changes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git checkout Gemfile\r\nUpdated 1 path from the index\r\n$ cat Gemfile\r\nsource \"https://rubygems.org\"\r\n\r\ngem \"jekyll\", \"4.2.0\"\r\ngem \"rouge\", \"3.26.0\"\r\ngem \"jekyll-redirect-from\", \"0.16.0\"\r\ngem \"webrick\", \"1.7\"\r\n\r\n$ git checkout Gemfile.lock\r\nUpdated 1 path from the index\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the install:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ bundle install\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nChecking the updated Jekyll version:\r\n```\r\n$ bundle exec jekyll --version\r\njekyll

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nModify `RandomDataGenerator.forType()` to allow generation of dates/timestamps that are valid in both Julian and Proleptic Gregorian calendars. Currently, the function can produce a date (for example `1582-10-06`) which is valid in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. Though it cannot be saved to ORC files AS IS since ORC format (ORC libs in fact) assumes Julian calendar. So, Spark shifts `1582-10-06` to the next valid date `1582-10-15` while saving it to ORC files. And as a consequence of that, the test fails because it compares original date `1582-10-06` and the date `1582-10-15` loaded back from the ORC files.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I propose to generate valid dates/timestamps in both calendars for ORC datasource till SPARK-34440 is resolved.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix failures of `HiveOrcHadoopFsRelationSuite`. For instance, the test \"test all data types\" fails with the seed **610710213676**:\r\n```\r\n== Results ==\r\n!== Correct Answer - 20 ==    == Spark Answer - 20 ==\r\n struct<index:int,col:date>

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nInfer the partitions schema by:\r\n1. interring the common type over all partition part values, and\r\n2. casting those values to the common type\r\n\r\nBefore the changes:\r\n1. Spark creates a literal with most appropriate type for concrete partition value i.e. `part0=-0` -> `Literal(0, IntegerType)`, `part0=abc` -> `Literal(UTF8String.fromString(\"abc\"), StringType)`.\r\n2. Finds the common type for all literals of a partition column. For the example above, it is `StringType`.\r\n3. Casts those literal to the desired type:\r\n  - `Cast(Literal(0, IntegerType), StringType)` -> `UTF8String.fromString(\"0\")`\r\n  - `Cast(Literal(UTF8String.fromString(\"abc\", StringType), StringType)` -> `UTF8String.fromString(\"abc\")`\r\n\r\nIn the example, we get a partition part value \"0\" which is different from the original one \"-0\". Spark shouldn't modify partition part values of the string type because it can influence on query results.\r\n\r\nCloses #31423\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe changes fix the bug demonstrated by the example:\r\n1. There are partitioned parquet files (file format doesn't matter):\r\n```\r\n/private/var/folders/p3/dfs6mf655d7fnjrsjvldh0tc0000gn/T/spark-e09eae99-7ecf-4ab2-b99b-f63f8dea658d\r\n├── _SUCCESS\r\n├── part=-0\r\n│   └── part-00001-02144398-2896-4d21-9628-a8743d098cb4.c000.snappy.parquet\r\n└── part=AA\r\n    └── part-00000-02144398-2896-4d21-9628-a8743d098cb4.c000.snappy.parquet\r\n```\r\nplaced to two partitions \"AA\" and **\"-0\"**.\r\n\r\n2. When reading them w/o specified schema:\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.read.parquet(path)\r\ndf.printSchema()\r\nroot\r\n |-- id: integer (nullable = true)\r\n |-- part: string (nullable = true)\r\n```\r\nthe inferred type of the partition column `part` is the **string** type.\r\n3. The expected values in the column `part` are \"AA\" and \"-0\" but we get:\r\n```\r\ndf.show(false)\r\n+---+----+\r\n|id |part|\r\n+---+----+\r\n|0  |AA  |\r\n|1  |0   |\r\n+---+----+\r\n```\r\nSo, Spark returns **\"0\"** instead of **\"-0\"**.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis PR can change query results.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new test and existing test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *FileIndexSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParquetV1PartitionDiscoverySuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSome command used to display some metadata, such as: `SHOW TABLES`, `SHOW TBLPROPERTIES` and so no.\r\nIf the output rows much than screen height, the output very unfriendly to developers.\r\nSo we should have a way to filter the output like the behavior of `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...`.\r\nWe could reference the implement of table valued function.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR provides a better way to display DDL when output rows much than screen height.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'. Just a new syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nJenkins test.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-11T02:59:01Z","updated_at":"2021-08-07T00:07:55Z","closed_at":"2021-08-07T00:07:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa4a58e85ba3cfab59c1f8b5dddcfb57a53a3f6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31548/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/31548/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/31548/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1d4a6b35c90c6f6bdc6b1c684709a0ebe10c1400","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-34127","ref":"SPARK-34127","sha":"1d4a6b35c90c6f6bdc6b1c684709a0ebe10c1400","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes to throw exception if non-streaming `Deduplicate` is not replaced by aggregate in query planner.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe replace some operations in the query optimizer. For them we throw some exceptions accordingly in query planner if these logical nodes are not replaced. But `Deduplicate` is missing and it opens a possible hole. For code consistency and to prevent possible unexpected query planning error, we should add similar exception case to query planner.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit
