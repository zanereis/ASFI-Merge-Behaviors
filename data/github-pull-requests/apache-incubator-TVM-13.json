Everyone,\r\n\r\nI assume that this automated Checksum calculation might be helpful for somebody to detect Soft Faults during the calculation of a Conv2D operation.\r\n\r\nSo I combined the knowledge from Hari. et. Al's Making Convolutions Resilient Via Algorithm-Based Error Detection Techniques and Uzair's  Efficient Software-Implemented HW Fault Tolerance for TinyML Inference in Safety-critical Applications to support both depthwise and standard Conv2D. \r\nThis pass adds multiple relay nodes and generates one output Tuple with the original result and additional boolean output for each \"secured\" Conv2D to recognize how many soft faults happened during the whole NN.\r\n\r\nI  am grateful for any tips/improvements in the

to issue #15319, this pass implements an in-place transformation for dataflow blocks. For each operator call in the dataflow block, the pass if at least one argument is not live past the call and has no aliases that are live past the call. If this condition is met for at least one argument, the operator can be replaced with an in-place version called via `call_tir_inplace`. The in-place version is a TIR `PrimFunc` that is produced by taking the legalizer for that operator and replacing its output with one of the inputs.\r\n\r\nThe liveness analysis is very simple since we are handling only single dataflow blocks. Handling general Relax control flow would require a solution more akin to #15689. The alias analysis, by contrast, is more complex since alias analysis is generally a tricky issue. It focuses on being able to handle common cases (especially tuples).","created_at":"2023-11-14T22:03:38Z","updated_at":"2024-01-17T22:05:54Z","closed_at":"2024-01-17T22:05:54Z","merged_at":"2024-01-17T22:05:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"a763b2211936d319d2177bc2a06e22f5284f4bc4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

to this commit, the `FuseTIR` pass explicitly tracked usage of\r\ntuple arguments, to minimize the set of arguments provided to each\r\nkernel.  The additional tgracking and handling of partially-used\r\ntuples makes it difficult to follow the primary changes being made by\r\n`FuseTIR`.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements the same functionality in terms of the\r\n`ExpandTupleArguments` and `RemoveUnusedParameters` transforms,\r\nintroduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16115 and\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16116 respectively.  By using these\r\npasses before the main `FuseOps` changes, partial tuple usage is\r\nalready handled at that point.\r\n\r\nThis commit is intended to minimize any changes to user-facing\r\nbehavior, and so these pre-process passes are currently used\r\ninternally by `FuseTIR`.  This may be avoided in the future by pulling\r\nthis internal delegation out into a lowering pipeline.","created_at":"2023-11-13T18:32:37Z","updated_at":"2024-01-03T17:09:08Z","closed_at":"2024-01-03T17:09:05Z","merged_at":"2024-01-03T17:09:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec542da8cf83456b7624b93ca9f317cc5ed18a03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/12f2386468bbd9eadf52bf286a24f78342adcef6","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_transform_refactor_fuse_tir","ref":"unity_transform_refactor_fuse_tir","sha":"12f2386468bbd9eadf52bf286a24f78342adcef6","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `FuseOps` pass explicitly tracked usage of\r\ntuple arguments, to minimize the set of arguments provided to each\r\nkernel.  The additional tgracking and handling of partially-used\r\ntuples makes it difficult to follow the primary changes being made by\r\n`FuseOps`.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements the same functionality in terms of the\r\n`ExpandTupleArguments` and `RemoveUnusedParameters` transforms,\r\nintroduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16115 and\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16116 respectively.  By using these\r\npasses before the main `FuseOps` changes, partial tuple usage is\r\nalready handled at that point.\r\n\r\nThis commit is intended to minimize any changes to user-facing\r\nbehavior, and so these pre-process passes are currently used\r\ninternally by `FuseOps`.  This may be avoided in the future by pulling\r\nthis internal delegation out into a lowering pipeline.","created_at":"2023-11-13T18:30:52Z","updated_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:23Z","closed_at":"2024-03-29T12:18:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb67e12c50a3e8249a4e3dd6747aca86ef1193ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16119/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16119/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16119/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/50b30a5376a28830dc6ea2f5aa9f6774d6194b55","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_transform_refactor_fuse_ops","ref":"unity_transform_refactor_fuse_ops","sha":"50b30a5376a28830dc6ea2f5aa9f6774d6194b55","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, the `DeadCodeElimination` and `FuseTIR` passes treated `R.ExternFunc` differently with respect to removal of internal functions: `DeadCodeElimination` treated these functions as internal, to be removed if there are no internal callers, while `FuseTIR` treated these functions as external, to be retained in all cases.\r\n\r\nBecause the visibility of a function is determined by the `tvm::attr::kGlobalSymbol` attribute; which is present for `PrimFunc` and `relax::Function`, but missing for `relax::ExternFunc`; there is no information in the `IRModule` that can determine whether a `relax::ExternFunc` should be visible externally.\r\n\r\nFor consistency, and to allow the use of `DeadCodeElimination` in future refactors of `FuseTIR`, this commit updates `DeadCodeElimination` to retain instances of `relax::ExternFunc`.","created_at":"2023-11-13T17:35:41Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T20:17:00Z","closed_at":"2023-11-14T14:21:05Z","merged_at":"2023-11-14T14:21:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"e7c73140469ba59a6ac3c1d585a49626f064566a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16118/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16118/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16118/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/45646a9945f0d4e40c312ebad919112f25729bdd","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_transform_keep_extern_func_in_dce","ref":"unity_transform_keep_extern_func_in_dce","sha":"45646a9945f0d4e40c312ebad919112f25729bdd","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

unused.","created_at":"2023-11-13T17:34:15Z","updated_at":"2023-11-30T14:18:59Z","closed_at":"2023-11-30T14:18:55Z","merged_at":"2023-11-30T14:18:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"d52a9bf388a289fa353cb6d34208086225fc4d87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16117/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16117/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16117/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bf903a20bb854b4e6830cefbb34243fe9f2a96cb","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:unity_transform_remove_unused_outputs","ref":"unity_transform_remove_unused_outputs","sha":"bf903a20bb854b4e6830cefbb34243fe9f2a96cb","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

functions used as subroutines may receive a tuple of arguments, but only use a subset of the arguments provided.  For externally-exposed functions, this is unavoidable, as the function signature may not be updated without breaking compatibility.  For internal functions, all callsites are contained within the `IRModule`, and can be updated at the same time as the function signature.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `RemoveUnusedParameters`, which removes unused parameters from the function signature, if they occur within a private function.  Together with `ExpandTupleArguments` implemented in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16115, this handles partially-exposed tuple arguments for internal

functions used as subroutines may receive a tuple of arguments, but only use a subset of the arguments provided.  For externally-exposed functions, this is unavoidable, as the function signature may not be updated without breaking compatibility.  For internal functions, all callsites are contained within the `IRModule`, and can be updated at the same time as the function signature.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements `ExpandTupleArguments`, which replaces `R.Tuple` parameters with separate parameters, when they occur in a private

PR supports controlling whether KV cache automatic growth is allowed through constructor parameter. Previously we always allow the KV cache to grow whenever it is full and more capacity is demanded.\r\n\r\nAlthough automatic growth can be good, in practice we often want the pre-allocated memory to be static, large enough and not changeable, which will make the memory management more controllable. Hence, this PR supports to specify if growth is allowed, and will throw error when growing in unallowed cases.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds an auxiliary function to KV cache to query the number of

PR enhances the static block memory planning pass. Prior to this PR, the memory planning only works on memory allocation that is not externally referenced. In dynamic shape settings, such memory allocation is not fully static and may lead to memory fragmentation.\r\n\r\nThis PR enhances the behavior, so that for such memory allocation, we first allocate a storage with regard to its estimated upper bound (when known), and then allocate the tensor with the actual dynamic shape out from the storage. This will ensure the static memory allocation and avoid memory

an `arm_cpu` conv2d NHWC schedule using a hybrid GeMM approach, effectively breaking down the matrix multiplication into a macro-kernel (partitioning into fixed-sized, tile-level subproblems) and a micro-kernel (independently dealing with each subproblem). After the im2col transformation, the input matrix is handled natively (not interleaved), while the weights matrix is tiled and interleaved at compile time.  \r\nIn the fp32 case, the micro-kernel uses 16 registers to accumulate the results of each 4x16 output tile, cycling through the operands needed to compute them (from the input and weight matrices) in the remaining registers.\r\n\r\nThere are now two ways to transform the weights matrix for conv2d, which are detailed in `convolution.cc`:\r\n* for int8 / uint8: tile, interleave, transpose\r\n* for everything else: tile, interleave\r\n\r\nTo maintain naming consistency across both of these implementations (transposed vs not transposed), all mentions of `tile_rows_B` or `tile_cols_B` have been changed to `tile_N` and `tile_K` respectively to denote the tiling size along each axis of the flattened B matrix. As usual, `N = out_channels` and `K = kernel_width * kernel_height * in_channels`.\r\n\r\nI have also added a new conv2d NHWC fp32 test for both the `conv2d_nhwc_spatial_pack` and `conv2d_NHWC_hybrid` schedules, as well as new fp32 and fp16 implementation selection tests in `test_select_implementation.py`.\r\n\r\ncc @ekalda @lhutton1 @neildhickey

PR adds an `axis` field to scatter_from_worker0, which means the tensor axis along which it is scattered. legalize_ops will automatically generate reshape and transpose to preserve the constraint of ccl that collective communication ops must be performed on contiguous memory. For example, if the tensor shape of x is [10, 20], and we have `scatter_from_worker0(x, num_workers=2, axis=1)`, then after legalization it will expand to \r\n\r\n```\r\nx = reshape(x, [10, 2, 10]) # shape: [10, 2, 10]\r\nx = permute_dims(x, [1, 0, 2]) # shape: [2, 10, 10]\r\nx = call_dps_packed(\"scatter_from_worker0\", x) # shape: [10, 10]\r\n```\r\nWhen axis=0, the behavior is the same as before.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, this PR renames ScatterFromWorker0Attrs to ScatterAttrs to enable reuse by other ops like worker-id-aware slicing (scatter_from_worker0 = broadcast_from_worker0 +  worker-id-aware slicing).\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-08T23:03:33Z","updated_at":"2023-11-09T15:39:30Z","closed_at":"2023-11-09T15:39:30Z","merged_at":"2023-11-09T15:39:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"384f9b69eae44b8331572f2c43be6a7b87913d10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16092/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16092/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16092/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/77358550774207756f94ebe3fc38c425ee6eebac","head":{"label":"jinhongyii:scatter_op_add_field","ref":"scatter_op_add_field","sha":"77358550774207756f94ebe3fc38c425ee6eebac","user":{"login":"jinhongyii","id":44201588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjAxNTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44201588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhongyii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":385965718,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODU5NjU3MTg=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jinhongyii/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinhongyii","id":44201588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjAxNTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44201588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhongyii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinhongyii/tvm","description":"Open

BlockBuilder would have a problem about naming of public function if we \r\n1) emit a private function, and then \r\n2) emit a public function with the same name. \r\n\r\nPreviously, BlockBuilder would rename the latter, i.e. the public function. That led the name of the public function did not match the name of its global_symbol attribute.\r\n\r\nTo tackle this problem, this PR introduces a new pass NormalizeGlobalVar. This pass will possibly rename the GlobalVar in an IRModule to ensure these properties:\r\n1. (Invariant) First ensure every public function has the same name as its \"global_symbol\" attribute ;\r\n2. To ensure 1., we may need to rename private functions with conflicting names; \r\n3. Finally, the name of every GlobalVar is unique in the IRModule.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a member function `bb.finalize()` to be used at the end of the building process. It will call NormalizeGlobalVar to ensure the invariant, and returns the final IRModule. It essentially substitutes the functionality of `bb.get()`, so we mark the latter deprecated.\r\n\r\nAbout naming: we can still use the interface `bb.get()` and execute a NormalizeGlobalVar pass in it. But such `bb.get()` can only be called once at the end of the building process. So we rename it to `bb.finalize()` for clearity and alignment with C++ side.\r\n\r\ncc @junrushao

processing matmul with transpose (permute_dims operator), the current gradient pass will introduce additional permute_dims ops. That's because the gradient visit all binding from last one to the first one, and matmul and permute_dims are regarded as two separate ops. E.g.\r\n\r\nForward is: \r\n```\r\nout = matmul(a, transpose(b))\r\n```\r\nThen backward is:\r\n```\r\ngrad_a = matmul(grad_out, transpose(transpose(b)))\r\ngrad_b = transpose(matmul(transpose(a), grad_out))\r\n```\r\nThis PR introduces a new pass, GradientSimplifier, and enhances the Gradient pass to simplify these patterns. The example above will be simplified to\r\n```\r\ngrad_a = matmul(grad_out, b)\r\ngrad_b = matmul(transpose(grad_out), a)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @yzh119 @MasterJH5574 @tqchen

PR focuses on adding supporting various mma intrinsics for matmul scheduling. To be specific, this PR:\r\n- Adds support for transposed A in ldmatrix and mma_sync\r\n- Changes all `T.launch_thread(tx, 32)` annotations to for loops `for tx in T.thread_binding(0, WARP_SIZE, \"threadIdx.x\")`. This is for the convenience of later transformation.\r\n- Refactor some logic and add a utility get_mma_intrin_group to get a group of intrinsics:\r\n```\r\ndef get_mma_intrin_group(\r\n    load_scope: Literal[\"shared\", \"shared.dyn\"],\r\n    store_scope: Literal[\"global\", \"shared\", \"shared.dyn\"],\r\n    in_dtype: Literal[\"float16\", \"int8\"],\r\n    out_dtype: Literal[\"float16\", \"float32\", \"int32\"],\r\n    trans_a: bool,\r\n    trans_b: bool,\r\n    not_use_mma_store_intrinic: bool = True,\r\n    store_to_smem_dtype: Optional[Literal[\"float16\", \"float32\", \"int32\"]] = None,\r\n) -> Dict[str, str]\r\n```\r\n- Avoid use the current mma_store intrinsic. Instread, use BufferStore statements. \r\n  - This is because if we use mma_store intrinsic, during swizzling shared memory visits, our rearrangement scheme will involve areas accessed by different mma_store calls. This makes swizzling quite complex. But BufferStore will not face this problem\r\n\r\nThis PR is used and tested in the dlight matmul schedule rule.\r\n\r\n@spectrometerHBH @vinx13 @Hzfengsy

PR introduces the new `InjectPermutedLayout` pass, partially adapted from the old version.\r\n\r\nThis pass will permute the visiting indices of the shared memory with xor operations to avoid bank conflicts. For permutation details see p39 of [these slides](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/video/gputechconf/gtc/2020/presentations/s21745-developing-cuda-kernels-to-push-tensor-cores-to-the-absolute-limit-on-nvidia-a100.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe current interface is:\r\n```\r\nwith T.block(\"...\"):\r\n    T.block_attr({\"permuted_layout\": 1})\r\n    # load or store to shared memory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe load/store operation could be:\r\n- BufferLoad node\r\n- BufferStore node\r\n- ptx_ldmatrix call\r\n- mma_store call\r\n\r\nAnd the InjectPermutedLayout pass is injected in the lowering process in `driver_api.cc`. So after this pass in the building stage, the visiting indices will be permuted.\r\n\r\nNotably this pass works after the `CompactBufferAllocation` pass because it relies on the shape of the shared memory in every threadblock.\r\n\r\ncc @spectrometerHBH @vinx13 @Hzfengsy

PR enhances the `SampleTopPFromProb` function, adding a new `unit_offset` parameter. With this PR, the input prob array can contain multiple prob distributions. The offset is used to specify which probability to sample from.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, this function assumes the input prob array only contains a single probability distribution.\r\nThis assumption, though effective, prevents efficient sampling for batching scenarios, since it forces us to split the batched prob array before sampling.\r\n\r\nThis PR eliminates this issue by introducing the

to this commit, `relax.op.call_tir` could express the TIR arguments as either an in-line tuple, or as a variable bound to a tuple.  Because several passes assume the arguments will always be an in-line tuple, this is being codified as the normal form of `relax.op.call_tir`.  Any upstream transform that produces `relax.op.call_tir` with arguments provided as a by-variable tuple will either be normalized to an in-line tuple if possible, or will produce an error during the upstream transform otherwise.\r\n\r\nThis commit is specifically to allow the current usage of `Downcast<Tuple>(call->args[1])` in passes such as `CallTIRRewrite`, `FoldConstant`, `FuseTIR`, and

Relax operators have requirements regarding their AST that are stronger than are checked by the C++ types being used.  These are similar to checks that are present in the `tvm::relax::WellFormed` utility, such as checks forbidding the use of undefined variables, which are also stronger than required by the underlying C++ types. However, because every operator may have unique requirements, it would be unreasonable to expect a writer of a `relax::ExprMutator` to be aware of and to maintain all such requirements.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an operation operator attribute `FNormalize`.  If defined, this function is used to apply an operator-specific normalization.  The implementation of `FNormalize` has the following design decisions.\r\n\r\n* If no change is required, `FNormalize` should return the input argument unmodified.\r\n\r\n* `FNormalize` is only responsible for normalization of the operator itself.  The expression it returns may be unnormalized (e.g. contain nested expressions).\r\n\r\n* `FNormalize` receives the `BlockBuilder` as an argument, to allow context-dependent normalization.\r\n\r\n  For example, an operator whose normalization requires in-line expressions may use `BlockBuilder::LookupBinding` to perform variable replacement.\r\n\r\n* `FNormalize` is applied after `FInferStructInfo`.  `FNormalize` may assume that the `relax::Call` passed to `FNormalize` has well-defined struct info.\r\n\r\n  * Corollary: `FInferStructInfo` may not assume that its `relax::Call` argument has been passed through `FNormalize`.\r\n\r\n    This is a reasonable requirement, because (1) shape inference should depend only on the struct info of arguments and not the values themselves, and (2) this only impacts operators that use `FNormalize`.\r\n\r\n* `FNormalize` should not be used to apply simplifications, and should be limited to cases where the same computation may be expressed in multiple manners.\r\n\r\n  For example, replacing a by-variable tuple with an in-line tuple in `R.call_tir` is a form of normalization, but replacing `R.add(arg, R.const(0))` with `arg` is a form of simplification.\r\n\r\n  This separation is to ensure that `FNormalize` has minimal overhead, as some simplifications may have large computational costs, and `FNormalize` is applied as part of all `ExprMutator` usage.  A later PR will introduce an attribute `FSimplify`, along with a dedicated pass to apply simplifications.\r\n\r\n* Use of `FNormalize` is suppressed while parsing TVMScript. TVMScript must be able to generate test cases that trigger specific failure modes, and that may include producing un-normalized relax IR.  In addition, TVMScript must be stable when passed through a round-trip from IR to text to IR.\r\n\r\n* If an `IRModule` contains any non-normalized operators, the `IRModule` is ill-formed.  That is, all `FNormalize` operations on a well-formed module are

PR supports clearing up all the allocated memory.\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR, all the allocated memory are managed in the pool of memory manager. The allocated memory in the pool is on hold and never freed. Consequently, the pool size always goes up monotonically within a single run in a process.\r\n\r\nWhile good to save time of memory allocation, in some cases (e.g., on mobile phones which may have running memory limit) we need to clear the pool and free all the memory in order to prevent the pool from endlessly growing up and some of allocated memory not being effectively utilized (fragmentation).\r\n\r\nTherefore, this PR introduces a PackedFunc that helps clean up the memory manager, releasing all the allocated memory. Runtime apps can decide when to invoke this PackedFunc and clean up the pool. Usually, this will happen at some app \"reset\" or \"reload\"

Nvidia tools such as Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute can be used for profiling cuda kernels. NVIDIA Nsight Systems collects system-wide information about your program and GPU events and might help you to understand possible bottlenecks in your topology. To profile concrete Cuda kernel, NVIDIA Nsight Compute can be used.\r\n\r\nIf you try to profile cuda kernel from TVM with Nsight Compute without this patch, then you see only SASS instructions instead of the source code. It is useful, but sometimes it might be easier to analyze generated cuda code instead of instructions. In this patch, a new pass config option was added. By using option `cuda.kernels_output_dir`, you can specify the directory where cuda source code should be stored after the build. Also, in the case of using this option, cuda kernels will be compiled with option `-lineinfo` which is an equivalent of `-g` option in GCC. When the cuda kernels were compiled with `-lineinfo` option, then Nsight compute can map profile information to the source code. One important note, that to get the source code in Nsight Compute, you have to set parameter `Import Source` during profiling session configuration equals to

PR fixes dtype issues for \r\n- the strides parameter of match_buffer. \r\n  - When stride is a tir var, it would become a string like `\"A_s0\"` in the printed script. \r\n  - If the strides are int64 vars, when we parse the printed script, the dtype of the strides will be set to int32 by default. That causes dtype misalign and effects the structural_equal check. \r\n  - We will cast the string stride to the dtype of shape (which is always a primexpr)\r\n- ramp node. If the dtypes of base and stride of a ramp node do not match, the dtype of stride will be casted to the dtype of base.","created_at":"2023-11-03T00:35:25Z","updated_at":"2023-11-07T01:01:45Z","closed_at":"2023-11-07T01:01:45Z","merged_at":"2023-11-07T01:01:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"df5d3b58b84fa3d5953185ec6a3a9eec7686825c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16051/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16051/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16051/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/350dbb5d213269f13c3338be78223393ee784690","head":{"label":"Ubospica:main-dev/2023-11-02-fix-dtype-issues","ref":"main-dev/2023-11-02-fix-dtype-issues","sha":"350dbb5d213269f13c3338be78223393ee784690","user":{"login":"Ubospica","id":32952380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTUyMzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32952380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica","html_url":"https://github.com/Ubospica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":603366021,"node_id":"R_kgDOI_aihQ","name":"tvm-develop","full_name":"Ubospica/tvm-develop","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ubospica","id":32952380,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyOTUyMzgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32952380?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica","html_url":"https://github.com/Ubospica","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ubospica/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ubospica/tvm-develop","description":"Open

behavior.","created_at":"2023-11-02T21:52:02Z","updated_at":"2023-11-08T19:58:16Z","closed_at":"2023-11-08T19:58:15Z","merged_at":"2023-11-08T19:58:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"9100a8e8c9906a2cd93730c1951f19b13de60de6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16049/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16049/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16049/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/260c70604ddd2406e74a658b83376737bf127f5c","head":{"label":"jinhongyii:lift_transform_param_symbolic_var","ref":"lift_transform_param_symbolic_var","sha":"260c70604ddd2406e74a658b83376737bf127f5c","user":{"login":"jinhongyii","id":44201588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjAxNTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44201588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhongyii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":385965718,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODU5NjU3MTg=","name":"tvm","full_name":"jinhongyii/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jinhongyii","id":44201588,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MjAxNTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44201588?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii","html_url":"https://github.com/jinhongyii","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jinhongyii/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jinhongyii/tvm","description":"Open

changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h1>23.3 (2023-10-15)</h1>\n<h2>Process</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Added reference to <code>vulnerability reporting guidelines &lt;https://www.python.org/dev/security/&gt;</code>_ to pip's security policy.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations and Removals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Drop a fallback to using SecureTransport on macOS. It was useful when pip detected OpenSSL older than 1.0.1, but the current pip does not support any Python version supporting such old OpenSSL versions. (<code>[#12175](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12175) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12175&gt;</code>_)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve extras resolution for multiple constraints on same base package. (<code>[#11924](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11924) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11924&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Improve use of datastructures to make candidate selection 1.6x faster. (<code>[#12204](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12204) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12204&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Allow <code>pip install --dry-run</code> to use platform and ABI overriding options. (<code>[#12215](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12215) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12215&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Add <code>is_yanked</code> boolean entry to the installation report (<code>--report</code>) to indicate whether the requirement was yanked from the index, but was still selected by pip conform to :pep:<code>592</code>. (<code>[#12224](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12224) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12224&gt;</code>_)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ignore errors in temporary directory cleanup (show a warning instead). (<code>[#11394](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11394) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11394&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Normalize extras according to :pep:<code>685</code> from package metadata in the resolver\nfor comparison. This ensures extras are correctly compared and merged as long\nas the package providing the extra(s) is built with values normalized according\nto the standard. Note, however, that this <em>does not</em> solve cases where the\npackage itself contains unnormalized extra values in the metadata. (<code>[#11649](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11649) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11649&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Prevent downloading sdists twice when :pep:<code>658</code> metadata is present. (<code>[#11847](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11847) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11847&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Include all requested extras in the install report (<code>--report</code>). (<code>[#11924](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11924) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11924&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Removed uses of <code>datetime.datetime.utcnow</code> from non-vendored code. (<code>[#12005](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12005) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12005&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Consistently report whether a dependency comes from an extra. (<code>[#12095](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12095) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12095&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Fix completion script for zsh (<code>[#12166](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12166) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12166&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Fix improper handling of the new onexc argument of <code>shutil.rmtree()</code> in Python 3.12. (<code>[#12187](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12187) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12187&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Filter out yanked links from the available versions error message: &quot;(from versions: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0)&quot; will not contain yanked versions conform PEP 592. The yanked versions (if any) will be mentioned in a separate error message. (<code>[#12225](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12225) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12225&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Fix crash when the git version number contains something else than digits and dots.

(<code>[#12306](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12306) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12306&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>Redact password from URLs in some additional places. (<code>[#12350](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12350) &lt;https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12350&gt;</code>_)</li>\n<li>pip uses less memory when caching large packages.

PR:\r\n- Supports `Analyzer.int_set(expr)` from python side. That is, exposing this API from C++ side. Previously we only support `Analyzer.int_set(expr, dom_map)`. \r\n- Adds some RewriteSimplifier rules for simplifying certain expressions:\r\n    - `min/max(x +- y, x)` where `y>=0` or `y<0`\r\n    - Supporting symbolic analysis in comparision expressions. That enables simplifying `x // 2 < y where x < y * 2` to `True`\r\n\r\ncc @spectrometerHBH @tqchen

PR restores the Metal codegen to the one before #15835. Due to there will likely be no internal function call in Metal, we think it is safe to do so.\r\n\r\nVerified that with this PR, the metal codegen and iPhone codegen will not fail and will work properly.\r\n\r\nThe reason of the iPhone codegen failure is because the multiple declarations of a same function will lead to multiple emissions of a same structs, which is not recognizable by the metal compiler.","created_at":"2023-11-01T19:10:52Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T19:58:11Z","closed_at":"2023-11-03T00:27:14Z","merged_at":"2023-11-03T00:27:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"043f1473280e2886525586b94607e22a1c0aa172","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16033/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16033/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16033/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/6105d1e1d72feb57d021e690893a09f5a7905f42","head":{"label":"MasterJH5574:tvm-dev/2023-11-01-metal-codegen","ref":"tvm-dev/2023-11-01-metal-codegen","sha":"6105d1e1d72feb57d021e690893a09f5a7905f42","user":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":311185744,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTExODU3NDQ=","name":"tvm","full_name":"MasterJH5574/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MasterJH5574","id":45167100,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTY3MTAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45167100?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574","html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MasterJH5574/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MasterJH5574/tvm","description":"Open

MemFunc);\r\nTVM_MODULE_VTABLE_ENTRY_PACKED(Name, Func);\r\nTVM_MODULE_VTABLE_END();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, one could conveniently define the callable symbols a TVM Module exposes, for example, `runtime::relax_vm::Exectuable`, by looking at the vtable below:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\nTVM_MODULE_VTABLE_BEGIN(\"VMExecutable\"); // type key\r\nTVM_MODULE_VTABLE_ENTRY(\"get_lib\", &Executable::GetLib);
