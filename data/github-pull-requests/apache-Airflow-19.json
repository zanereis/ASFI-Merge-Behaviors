tests execution was traditionally using single \"breeze testing tests\" command and you could select which test to run via TEST_TYPE.\r\n\r\nHowever the recent move of providers and adding task_sdk necessitates splitting the tests commands into separate commands for core, providers, task_sdk, helm, integration and system.\r\n\r\nThis is done via introducing \"TEST_GROUP\" - which determines which group of tests is being executed, and dedicated testing command for each of the groups - with \"db\" and \"non-db\" variants where applicable.\r\n\r\nCleanup and small refactoring has been done to make it easier to reason about parameters passed down from the command line to docker and in-container pytest command.\r\n\r\nRelated: #42632\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software

Description\r\n\r\nEdge worker runs into UnicodeDecodeError exception during log file upload. The Worker reads log file as string and counts number of string characters to seek into the file during uploading next log file part. This can result in mismatch between number of bytes and number of string characters if log file contains none UTF-8 characters. So during upload of next log file part worker can jump between 2 bytes of none utf-8 characters and crashes. Edge worker now uses read bytes to calc place to seek into and decode string as UTF-8 to handle none UTF-8 charaters.\r\n\r\n# Details about changes\r\n\r\n* Worker reads log file as byte string to calc number of read bytes to seek in.\r\n* Worker decode byte string to UTF-8\r\n* Changed unit tests to test none UTF-8 log

was observed that there are moments where the TI tries endpoint returns duplicate TaskInstance. I have observed this to happen when the TI is in up_for_retry state.\r\n\r\nWhen the TI is in up_for_retry state, we have already recorded the previous try in TI history and the TI try_number has not incremented at this time, so we must exclude this recorded TI from the taskinstance tries endpoint. We know the TI because its state is in up_for_retry, so we filter TIs with up_for_retry state when querying for the task instance tries.\r\n\r\nCloses: #41765\r\n(cherry picked from commit

filter query parameters. I'd appreciate your feedback before proceeding with refactoring other endpoints to align with this approach.\r\n\r\nSince parameter types need to be specified statically to generate the OpenAPI schema, it is necessary to have a corresponding `filter_param_factory` for each common type ( Like `float_range_filter_factory` and `datetime_range_filter_factory` for `RangeFilter` ).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n","created_at":"2024-11-13T03:07:00Z","updated_at":"2024-12-03T16:55:19Z","closed_at":"2024-12-03T16:55:19Z","merged_at":"2024-12-03T16:55:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"31ba41e0244d2507832021fde09923db007bebb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"bbovenzi","id":4600967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDA5Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4600967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi","html_url":"https://github.com/bbovenzi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bbovenzi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

is a very interesting breaking change introduced in Python 3.11 that will likely mean that we should not use MetaPathFinder for old standard provider classes redirection.\r\n\r\nThere was a change introduced in Python 3.11 that caused that module might not be found in some cases (for example when unit test patches the path) when the module is loaded as a different module (i.e. a.b differs from sys.modules['a.b'])\r\n\r\nThis is tracked in CPython via:\r\nhttps://github.com/python/cpython/issues/117860\r\n\r\nThis causes standard operator's tests fail in Python 3.11 and 3.12 when the providers/tests/standard/test_module_redirect_finder.py is executed before - i.e. the standard modules are loaded as old modules.\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit

I'd appreciate any feedback.\r\n\r\n## Issue description\r\n\r\nrelated: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40802\r\n\r\nThere are some OpenTelemetry standard practices that help keep the usage consistent across multiple projects. According to those\r\n* when a root span starts, the trace id and the span id are generated randomly\r\n* while the span is active, the context is captured\r\n  * injected into a carrier object which is a map or a python dictionary\r\n* the carrier with the captured context is propagated across services and used to create sub spans\r\n* the new sub-span extracts the parent context from the carrier and uses it to set the parent\r\n  * the trace id is accessed from the carrier and the span id is generated randomly\r\n\r\nTo explain more, this is what the flow of operations should be\r\n1. Dag run starts - start `dagrun` span\r\n    i. Get the `dagrun` span context\r\n2. Start task - with the `dagrun` context, start `ti` span\r\n    i. Get the `ti` span context\r\n4. With the `ti` span context create task-sub span\r\n5. Task finishes - `ti` span ends\r\n6. Dag run finishes - `dagrun` span ends \r\n\r\nAirflow follows a different approach\r\n* trace and span ids are generated in a deterministic way from various properties  of the `dag_run` and the `task_instance`\r\n* the spans for a dag and its tasks, are generated after the run has finished\r\n\r\nThis is the flow of the current implementation\r\n1. Dag run starts\r\n2. Tasks start\r\n3. Tasks finish\r\n4. Create spans for the tasks\r\n5. Dag run finishes\r\n6. Create span for the dag run\r\n\r\nThe current approach makes it impossible to create spans from under tasks while using the existing airflow code. To achieve that, you need to use https://github.com/howardyoo/airflow_otel_provider which has to generate the same trace id and span id as airflow otherwise the spans won't be properly associated. This isn't easily maintainable and it also makes it hard for people that are familiar with otel but new to airflow, to start using the feature.\r\n\r\nThese are some references to OpenTelemetry docs\r\n\r\nhttps://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/context-propagation/\r\nhttps://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/propagation/\r\nhttps://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/\r\n\r\n## Implementation description\r\n\r\nFor the dagrun and ti spans, I've reused the attributes from the original implementation. I found in my testing that the span timings were occasionally off. That was due to the fact that the time conversion to nanoseconds wasn't considering that the timezone isn't always present.\r\n\r\nTo be able to propagate the context of a span, and use it to create subspan, the span must be active.\r\n\r\nFor example, for a dag run, the span can't be created at the end but \r\n* it needs to start with the run\r\n* stay active so that the context can be captured and propagated\r\n* end once the run also ends\r\n\r\nSame goes for a task and any sub-spans.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, we can use the new otel methods for creating spans directly from under a task without the need of the `airflow_otel_provider`. These spans will be children of the task span.\r\n\r\nCheck `test_otel_dag.py` for an example of usage.\r\n\r\nIn scheduler HA, multiple schedulers might process a dag, that is running for a long time. The OpenTelemetry philosophy is that spans can't be shared between processes. The process that starts a span should also be the only one that can end it.\r\n\r\nTo workaround that while staying consistent with the otel spec, each scheduler will keep track of the spans that it starts and will also be solely responsible for ending them.  \r\n\r\nLet's assume that we are expecting these spans to be created and exported\r\n\r\n```\r\ndag_span\r\n    |_ task1_span\r\n          |_ task1_sub1_span\r\n                |_ task1_sub1_sub_span\r\n          |_ task1_sub2_span\r\n    |_ task2_span\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the existing airflow implementation, the spans will be\r\n```\r\ndag_span\r\n    |_ task1_span\r\n    |_ task2_span\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are some possible scenarios and how the dag spans will look like, assuming that the dag creates the same spans as above\r\n\r\n1. Scheduler1 processes a dag from start to finish.\r\n    ```\r\n    dag_span\r\n        |_ task1_span\r\n              |_ task1_sub1_span\r\n                    |_ task1_sub1_sub_span\r\n              |_ task1_sub2_span\r\n        |_ task2_span\r\n    ```\r\n2. Scheduler1 starts a dag and sometime during the run, Scheduler2 picks up the processing and finishes the dag.\r\n\r\n    Through a db update, Scheduler2 will notify whoever scheduler started the spans, to end them.\r\n    ```\r\n    dag_span\r\n        |_ task1_span\r\n              |_ task1_sub1_span\r\n                    |_ task1_sub1_sub_span\r\n              |_ task1_sub2_span\r\n        |_ task2_span\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. Scheduler1 starts a dag and while the dag is running, exits gracefully. Scheduler2 picks up the processing and finishes the dag while the initial scheduler is no longer running.\r\n\r\n    Scheduler1 will end all active spans that it has a record of and update the db, while exiting. Scheduler2 will create continued spans. This will result in 2 or more spans in place of a long span, but the total duration will be the same. The continued span will be the new parent.\r\n    ```\r\n    dag_span\r\n        |_ task1_span\r\n        |_ scheduler_exits_span\r\n        |_ new_scheduler_span\r\n        |_ dag_span_continued\r\n              |_ task1_span_continued\r\n                    |_ task1_sub1_span\r\n                          |_ task1_sub1_sub_span\r\n                    |_ task1_sub2_span\r\n              |_ task2_span\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n4. Scheduler1 starts a dag and while the dag is running, exits forcefully. Scheduler2 picks up the processing and finishes the dag while the initial scheduler is no longer running.\r\n\r\n    Scheduler1 didn't have time to end any spans. Once the new scheduler picks up that the scheduler that started the spans, is unhealthy, it will recreate the lost spans.\r\n    ```\r\n    dag_span_recreated\r\n        |_ task1_span_recreated\r\n              |_ task1_sub1_span\r\n                    |_ task1_sub1_sub_span\r\n              |_ task1_sub2_span\r\n        |_ task2_span\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* Added a new unit test for the `otel_tracer` methods and updated the existing ones\r\n* Added an integration test for each possible scenario\r\n* Updated the existing tests to handle the changes\r\n* Tested the changes manually with a `PythonVirtualenvOperator` without issues\r\n\r\nThe integration test can be used with otel and jaeger as well.

DB migration, I have not changed the column type of `value`; it is still `LargeBinary`/`LONGBLOB` (MySQL).\r\n\r\nAs part of Airflow 3, we should strongly recommend users to use the `airflow db clean` command to prune the DBs to the minimum required. If we assume, most users would do that, we can run the following migration:\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Try to migrate pickle to JSON\r\n```python\r\ndef upgrade():\r\n    bind = op.get_bind()\r\n    session = Session(bind=bind)\r\n\r\n    for row in session.query(XCom).all():\r\n        try:\r\n            unpickled_data = pickle.loads(row.value)\r\n            row.value = json.dumps(unpickled_data).encode('utf-8')\r\n        except (pickle.UnpicklingError, json.JSONDecodeError):\r\n            # If unpickling fails, assume it's already JSON and skip\r\n            continue\r\n\r\n    op.alter_column(\"xcom\", \"value\", type_=sa.Text)\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Option 2: Delete XCom rows with pickle\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom airflow.models.xcom import BaseXCom\r\n\r\ndef upgrade():\r\n    bind = op.get_bind()\r\n    session = Session(bind=bind)\r\n\r\n    pickled_xcoms = session.query(BaseXCom).filter(BaseXCom.value.isnot(None))\r\n    \r\n    deleted_count = 0\r\n    for xcom in pickled_xcoms:\r\n        if xcom.value.startswith(b'\\x80'):  # Identify as pickled by protocol marker: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/494360afd00dc8f6b549f160525c3e86ec14905d/Lib/pickletools.py#L2122-L2133\r\n            session.delete(xcom)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 3: Keep the current column type\r\n\r\nNot optimal, but we can keep the current column type to binary/long-blob\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The shift towards `logical_date` helps move away from the limitations of `execution_date`, particularly with dynamic DAG runs and cases where multiple runs occur at the same time.\r\n\r\n### **Key Changes**\r\n- Replaced all instances of `execution_date` with `logical_date` including models.\r\n- Updated references in database models, templates, and functions.\r\n- Removed unique constraints on `execution_date` in the database to allow multiple DAG runs with the same logical time.\r\n\r\n### **How `execution_date` and `logical_date` Work**\r\n1. **Logical date is equivalent to execution date**: The two are just different names for the same value.\r\n2. **Timetable controls logical date**: The logical date can be set to any value, not necessarily tied to the data interval's start or end.\r\n3. **Schedules dictate behavior**: For value-based schedules (like cron), the logical date is set by the timetable class used.\r\n\r\n### **Transitioning from `execution_date`**\r\n- Airflow 3.0 will fully remove `execution_date`.\r\n- For uniquely identifying runs:\r\n  - Use `run_id` for human-readable identifiers.\r\n  - Use `data_interval_start`/`data_interval_end` for data partitioning in future.\r\n  - `id` (auto-incremented) is recommended for ordering DAG runs.\r\n- If your existing logic relies on `execution_date`, switch to using `data_interval_start` or `data_interval_end` for identifying time ranges.\r\n\r\n### **Testing**\r\n- Updated unit tests to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

eventual goal of this \"airflow.sdk.exeuction_time\" package is to replace\r\nLocalTaskJob and StandardTaskRunner, but at this stage it co-exists with it's\r\nreplacement.\r\n\r\nAs this PR is not a complete re-implementation of all the features that exist\r\ncurrently (no handling of task level callbacks yet, no AirflowSkipException\r\netc.) the current tests are skeleton at best. Once we get closer to feature\r\nparity (in future PRs) the tests will grow to match.\r\n\r\nThis supervisor and task runner operates slightly differently to the current\r\nclasses in these ways\r\n\r\n**Logs from the subprocess are send over a different channel to stdout/stderr**\r\n\r\nThis makes the task supervisor a little bit more complex as it now has to\r\nread stdout, stderr and a logs channel. The advantage of this approach is\r\nthat it makes the logs setup in the task process itself markedly simpler --\r\nall it has to do is write logs output to the custom file handle as JSON and\r\nit will show up \"natively\" as logs.\r\n\r\nstructlog has been chosen as the logging engine over stdlib's own logging as\r\nthe ability to have structured fields in the logs is nice, and stdlib is\r\nconfigured to send logs to a stuctlog processor.\r\n\r\n**Direct database access is replaced with an HTTP API client**\r\n\r\nThis is the crux of this feature and of AIP-72 in general -- tasks run via\r\nthis runner can no longer access DB models or DB session directly. This PR\r\ndoesn't yet implement the code/shims to make `Connection.get_connection_from_secrets`\r\nuse this client yet - that will be future work.\r\n\r\nThe reason tasks don't speak directly to the API server is primarily for two\r\nreasons:\r\n\r\n1. The supervisor process already needs to maintain an http session in order\r\n   to report the task as started, to heart beat it, and to mark it as\r\n   finished; and so because of that\r\n2. Reduce the number of active HTTP connections for tasks to 1 per task\r\n   (instead of 2 per task).\r\n\r\nTHe other reason we have this interface is that DAG parsing code will very\r\nsoon need to be updated to not have direct DB access either, and having this\r\n\"in process\" interface ability already means that we can support commands like\r\n`airflow dags reserialize` without having a running API server.\r\n\r\nThe API client itself is not auto-generated: I tried a number of different\r\nclient generates based on the OpenAPI spec and found them all lacking or buggy\r\nin different ways, and the http client side itself is very simple, the only\r\ninteresting/difficult bit is the generation of the datamodels from the OpenAPI\r\nspec which I found one that\r\n\r\nmsgspec was chosen over Pydantic as it is much lighter weight (and thus\r\nquicker), especially on a client side when we have next to no validation\r\nrequirements of response data. I admit that I have not benchmarked it\r\nspecifically though.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#42700\r\n\r\nAdds dag run and task instance metrics from historical metrics endpoint to dashboard.\r\n\r\n* The bar charts will be added later once API is available.\r\n* Checkboxes are missing. It seems in chakra 3 adding a components takes a few more steps.\r\n* State colors are of more contrast and might need to be toned down.\r\n* Some padding to center text in the status box. Probably there should be some bubble text type of component.\r\n* Currently the select box has preset hours shown to users at last 1, 8, 12 and 24 hours. This can be a component where users can select date time freely on their own.

Airflow 3.0 on main is migrating to FastAPI so must also Edge provider move...\r\n\r\nInitial MVP was built on Connexion endpoint, made it working in 2.10. This PR adds support for FastAPI on the API back-ends as a hybrid.

further use AIP-44 but the Edge Package not anymore) - Needed to wipe-off AIP-44\r\n- Integration of AIP-74 Task SDK - can be done once this would be able to run

#43660  \r\nRelated: #43657  \r\n\r\n### Feature\r\n\r\nI’ve placed the endpoint in `airflow/api_fastapi/core_api/routes/public/job.py`, but I’m not certain if this is the most appropriate location—perhaps `airflow/api_fastapi/core_api/routes/cli/job.py` would also fine ?\r\nThe query parameters, response data models, and implementation are consistent with the rest of the public API, utilizing `common.parameters` and `paginated_select`.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nThe test cases are refactored from the original [airflow/tests/cli/commands/test_jobs_command.py](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/tests/cli/commands/test_jobs_command.py), as the CLI should yield the same results when leveraging the API instead of direct DB access.\r\n\r\n### Question\r\n\r\nHi @bugraoz93, I’m curious about the distinction between this PR’s endpoint (List Jobs with filters) and #43661 (List Jobs), as both endpoints seem to provide job listings.

toggling pause for a dag with recent dagrun in the dags list page only the list dags and dag detail API are invalidated. On re-render of the page the dagruns API has stale data with older value for is_paused which is used thus not reflecting the change in UI though the patch API to update the dag was successful. For dags with recent dag runs use data from dags list API which has the updated value since the cache is invalidated. Another fix would be to invalidate the recent dagruns API too through useDagsServiceRecentDagRunsKey in TogglePause success but that results in an unnecessary API call.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce : \r\n\r\n1. Go to dags list page with one of the filters selected like success.\r\n2. Toggle pause slider for the dag.\r\n3. API call for update is made but the UI doesn't reflect the changes until page is refreshed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/6d85a0466d91d501af87c8904b902ea92cee466d/airflow/ui/src/components/TogglePause.tsx#L38-L46","created_at":"2024-11-10T06:47:14Z","updated_at":"2024-11-11T17:07:25Z","closed_at":"2024-11-11T17:07:25Z","merged_at":"2024-11-11T17:07:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"02003219d695af23b419eaa7213e5bee0644be1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ryanahamilton","id":3267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton","html_url":"https://github.com/ryanahamilton","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ryanahamilton/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jscheffl","id":95105677,"node_id":"U_kgDOBasyjQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/95105677?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl","html_url":"https://github.com/jscheffl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jscheffl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2514952451,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTE0OTUyNDUx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:UI","name":"area:UI","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"Related to UI/UX.

to this change, `random_name_suffix` was only documented but not implemented as a configurable option. Passing this value as an argument had no effect. This commit introduces a `false` option for `random_name_suffix`, which prevents the generation of a random suffix for the pod name. For compatibility, the default value is set to `true`, ensuring the pod name will still conform to `MAX_LABEL_LEN = 63`.\r\n\r\nFixes: #43800

working on https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/42700 I found that dagruns in running state without `end_date` are not returned even with current time sent as `end_date`. It seems that in the query `end_date` on being null uses `timezone.utcnow()` which will have a value greater than the frontend `end_date` value due to HTTP latency in the order of milliseconds to seconds thus never returning running dagruns and task instances associated with the corresponding dagrun. It's okay to allow dagruns with a start_date and no end_date which usually means they are in running state. Please correct me if I am missing any scenario regarding
