tests using symbolic shapes have been broken since https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14396. A BYOC function's return `sinfo` refers to a sym var defined inside that function. When a call to that is replaced by an opaque `call_dps_packed`, we cannot use `func->ret_struct_info` anymore since it refers to a sym var that's gone. \r\n\r\nIt's more mysterious why `RunCodegen` on symbolic shape had been working before 14396... Perhaps `main` happens to define the same-named sym var, which happens to capture the undefined variable in `func->ret_struct_info`. Perhaps that is exactly what https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14396 prevents. \r\n\r\nThe failing cutlass test is now working but it is not tested on CI. Cublas tests will be added in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14291 which run on CI. We should also consider enabling cutlass tests on CI. \r\n\r\n@sunggg @vinx13 @psrivas2 @Hzfengsy

PR improves cutlass compilation time, by compiling a single CSourceModule instead of creating and compiling one for each kernel.\r\n\r\nCreating and compiling a new CSourceModule for every function is quite slow and slows down model with multiple functions offloaded to cutlass quite significantly. Instead we can generate a single CSourceModule and compile it once to produce a single `runtime::Module`.\r\nThis brings down the cutlass compilation time of large models like SD Unet significantly (~30 min to ~4 min). Similar results on other large models.\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n`tests/python/relax/test_codegen_cutlass.py::test_matmul_offload` is broken at HEAD. This PR passes on all other tests when tested locally.\r\n\r\ncc @masahi @vinx13

it.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-03T11:46:04Z","updated_at":"2023-11-05T09:43:08Z","closed_at":"2023-04-04T03:23:30Z","merged_at":"2023-04-04T03:23:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c2058dc3cb6e3453efb954eda68f5edaa25c535","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:

is for resolving https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/14461\r\n\r\nThe direct cause of this problem is that the order of input nodes found in `_analysis.free_vars(ret)` is not guaranteed in the order of names in `input_info`. From what I understand, `_analysis.free_vars(ret)` uses DFS to find input nodes from output nodes. Since DFS cannot guarantee the order in which nodes are found, it is intuitive to modify the order of input nodes after DFS, as shown in this

PR fixes a bug in TVMScript printer handling tuples on the RHS of an assignment, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n... = (a, b, c)\r\n      ^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe existing  sugar removes the brackets surrounding `(a, b, c)`, which makes it slightly more readable as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n... = a, b, c\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it overlooks a possibility where the tuple could be empty or has only one element, i.e.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n... = (a, ) // Case 1: The tuple has only one element\r\n... = ()    // Case 2: The tuple is empty\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both cases, removing brackets may lead to wrong outcome.\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes this bug.","created_at":"2023-04-02T22:16:55Z","updated_at":"2023-04-02T23:59:19Z","closed_at":"2023-04-02T23:59:19Z","merged_at":"2023-04-02T23:59:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"1527bfba0453d0f375c8c200fa3ee668680e2e56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14452/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/14452/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/14452/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/dd06ca7267aa8d5ff1ed75142638305f32c5cb3b","head":{"label":"junrushao:bugfix/2023-04-02/tuple-printing","ref":"bugfix/2023-04-02/tuple-printing","sha":"dd06ca7267aa8d5ff1ed75142638305f32c5cb3b","user":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445038278,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoa-xg","name":"tvm","full_name":"junrushao/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"junrushao","id":22515877,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTE1ODc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22515877?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao","html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/junrushao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/junrushao/tvm","description":"Open

the change wants to fix https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/14364 where our `compute-inline` validity check failed. \r\n- Do not depend on undefined var counting, since dynamic loop extents may also be counted. The fast path just check the store indices should be the same with the block iter vars, which would cover the most cases.\r\n- Add fallback implementation for store indices which are bijective wrt block iter vars, which is already utilized in `reverse-compute-inline` implementation.\r\n- The change do not check the inlined producer's region cover the consumer. Refer to unittest `test_compute_inline_out_of_bound_consumer`, the previous behavior is not changed in this

Motivation\r\nCurrently the `reorder` primitive only changes the loops, and block iterable variables order would not be changed.\r\n`transform_block_layout` can change the block iterable variables, but it requires the loops outside the given block to have no branches, which limited its usage.\r\n\r\nThis schedule primitive changes the block iterable variable order directly, with API like:\r\n```python\r\ndef reorder_block_iter_var(self, block: BlockRV, new_order: List[int]) -> None:\r\n    \"\"\"Reorder the itervars inside a given block.\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    block : BlockRV\r\n        The block to be transformed. \r\n    new_order : List[int]\r\n        The new block itervar order.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n```\r\nwhere the `new_order` is a permutation of [0, 1, ..., n-1] if n is the number of itervars in the block.\r\n\r\n# Example\r\n\r\nSuppose we need to change the block itervar order in block \"C\":\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef matmul(A: T.Buffer[(128, 128), \"float32\"], B: T.Buffer[(128, 128), \"float32\"], C: T.Buffer[(128, 128), \"float32\"]) -> None:\r\n    for i, j, k in T.grid(128, 128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"C\"):\r\n            vi, vj, vk = T.axis.remap(\"SSR\", [i, j, k])\r\n            with T.init():\r\n                C[vi, vj] = 0.0\r\n            C[vi, vj] = C[vi, vj] + A[vi, vk] * B[vj, vk]\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter applying:\r\n```python\r\nsch = tir.Schedule(matmul, debug_mask=\"all\")\r\nC = sch.get_block(\"C\")\r\nsch.reorder_block_iter_var(C, [2, 1, 0])\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe block itervar order would be changed to `vk, vj, vi`.\r\n```python\r\n@T.prim_func\r\ndef matmul_after_reorder_block_iter_var(A: T.Buffer[(128, 128), \"float32\"], B: T.Buffer[(128, 128), \"float32\"], C: T.Buffer[(128, 128), \"float32\"]):\r\n    for i, j, k in T.grid(128, 128, 128):\r\n        with T.block(\"C\"):\r\n            vk, vj, vi = T.axis.remap(\"RSS\", [k, j, i])\r\n

Unity, we have a clear distinction between `tensor` and `shape`: we have `ShapeExpr` and `ShapeStructInfo` in AST, `ShapeTuple` in runtime container. Meanwhile, most of operators and their TOPI implementations are defined with tensors. For example, `relax.take` is defined as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Operator definition\r\nTVM_REGISTER_OP(\"relax.take\")\r\n    .set_attrs_type<TakeAttrs>()\r\n    .set_num_inputs(2)\r\n    .add_argument(\"x\", \"Tensor\", \"The source tensor.\")\r\n    .add_argument(\"indices\", \"Tensor\", \"The indices of the values to extract.\")\r\n    .set_attr<FInferStructInfo>(\"FInferStructInfo\", InferStructInfoTake);\r\n       \r\nStructInfo InferStructInfoTake(const Call& call, const BlockBuilder& ctx) {\r\n  Array<TensorStructInfo> input_sinfo = GetInputTensorStructInfo(call, ctx);\r\n   // Assume inputs are `Tensor` \r\n  TensorStructInfo data_sinfo = input_sinfo[0];\r\n  TensorStructInfo indices_sinfo = input_sinfo[1];\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// TOPI\r\ninline Tensor take(const Tensor& a, const Tensor& indices, int batch_dims, int axis, ...)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTo allow the shape computation, this PR introduces a `shape_to_tensor` op that converts `ShapeTuple` to `NDArray` at runtime. This enables the common shape computation patterns like following:\r\n```\r\nshape_var: R.Shape(ndim=4)\r\nlv: R.Tensor((4,), dtype=\"int64\") = R.shape_to_tensor(shape_var)\r\nlv1: R.Tensor((1,), dtype=\"int64\") = R.take(lv, indices, axis=0)\r\nlv2: R.Tensor((1, 1), dtype=\"int64\") = R.expand_dims(lv1, axis=[0])\r\ngv: R.Tensor((1, 1), dtype=\"int64\") = R.concat((lv2,), axis=0)\r\n```\r\nIt's worth noting that `tensor_to_shape` op is already introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14282, so roundtrip between shape and tensor would be now possible. \r\n\r\nCurrently, this op requires special handling in `FoldConstant` pass since this pass is only able to evaluate `TIR primfunc`, not `PackedFunc`. Once we extend `FoldConstant` to support `PackedFunc` evaluation, we should be able to remove these unnecessary special handling. \r\n\r\ncc. @jwfromm @yongwww @psrivas2 @slyubomirsky @tqchen

to the existing call node based matching & rewriting that requires a common post-dominator in a pattern (introduced in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14312), it lets us match a tree structure and replace leaf nodes or branches with new expression.\r\n\r\nThis can be immediately used for combining any number of multiple matmuls sharing the same LHS into one matmul. In Relay, we have a dedicated pass for that purpose (`CombineParallelDense`), but we can achieve the same thing via graph (tree) matching and rewrite. \r\n\r\nFor example, in SD UNet we have many three parallel matmul for QKV projections. In addition, there are also highly non-obvious parallel matmuls consisting of 32 or 22 of them. Those patterns can all be matched and rewritten via the following generic pattern and rewriter. \r\nhttps://github.com/masahi/web-stable-diffusion/blob/unet-opt/test.py#L37-L68\r\n\r\nI got all matmul combining for SD UNet working. It reduces the number of `R.matmul` from 200 to 116.\r\nOriginal: https://gist.github.com/masahi/0dab4b8f53115da9c33f4352c9175a87\r\nRewritten: https://gist.github.com/masahi/57ab925a43d2343cbfdb79a31c5b9946 (look for `R.concat` followed by `R.matmul` to see where rewriting happened)\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the same reduction possible using

is a fix for the issue described in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/14417#issuecomment-1490049917\r\n\r\nIn graph pattern matching, backtracking behavior is implemented by undoing matchings in `undo_stack`. When an intermediate fails to match, `undo_stack`s for parent and child nodes that have matched tentatively also need to be cleaned up as well. This corner-case handling is missing in the current implementation. \r\n\r\nThe fix is to return `undo_stack` from recursive `try_match` calls when matching succeeds, and merge parent / child `undo_stack` with the `undo_stack` for the \"current\" node\r\n\r\n@ganler @sunggg @cyx-6

to the typical, structural matching (e.g. matching `is_op` based pattern against `CallNode`), graph pattern matching requires additionally specifying `used_by` constraints. This leads to an obvious redundancy in the usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmatmul1 = is_op(\"relax.matmul\")(inp_pat, Q_weight_pat)\r\nmatmul2 = is_op(\"relax.matmul\")(inp_pat, K_weight_pat)\r\nmatmul3 = is_op(\"relax.matmul\")(inp_pat, V_weight_pat)\r\n\r\ninp_pat.used_by(matmul1, 0)\r\ninp_pat.used_by(matmul2, 0)\r\ninp_pat.used_by(matmul3, 0)\r\n\r\nQ_weight_pat.only_used_by(matmul1, 1)\r\nK_weight_pat.only_used_by(matmul2, 1)\r\nV_weight_pat.only_used_by(matmul3, 1)\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis PR hacks `is_op` constructor by automatically adding such `used_by` constraints between caller and callee patterns. See the simplified test case for QOL improvement.\r\n\r\n@ganler @sunggg

pattern matching uses `std::map` and `std::set` keyed on pointers, which leads to non-deterministic matching result. This PR removed all non-determinism. \r\n\r\nFor example, consider matching against QKV projection before attention. Given a sequence of bindings,\r\n```\r\nwith R.dataflow():\r\n    lv0 = R.matmul(x, w0)\r\n    lv1 = R.matmul(x, w1)\r\n    lv2 = R.matmul(x, w2)\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nand patterns,\r\n```\r\nwith PatternContext() as ctx:\r\n    inp_pat = wildcard()\r\n    Q_weight_pat = wildcard()\r\n    K_weight_pat = wildcard()\r\n    V_weight_pat = wildcard()\r\n\r\n    matmul1 = is_op(\"relax.matmul\")(inp_pat, Q_weight_pat)\r\n    matmul2 = is_op(\"relax.matmul\")(inp_pat, K_weight_pat)\r\n    matmul3 = is_op(\"relax.matmul\")(inp_pat, V_weight_pat)\r\n```\r\n\r\nintuitively I expect the following matching result:\r\n```\r\nQ_weight_pat - w0\r\nK_weight_pat - w1\r\nV_weight_pat - w2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut since three matmul patterns are independent of each other, each pattern can match any of three matmuls in the bindings. And since graph pattern matching processes patterns and variables in the bindings in a non-deterministic order, matching result becomes non deterministic as well. \r\n\r\nTo make graph pattern matching deterministic, I introduced an implicit ordering constraint on the patterns: Patterns are matched in the order that they are declared in the pattern context. So in the example above, we make sure to start pattern matching from the first matmul pattern. Likewise, the variables in the bindings, which are the candidates for matching, are also considered for matching in the order they appear in the bindings. So `lv0` is matched first, followed by `lv1` etc.\r\n\r\n@ganler @sunggg

was found that for standalone elementwise operations (add, sub, etc.) MetaScheduler generates code with poor performance due to lack of vector code on some input tensor shapes. Current implementation is not able to vectorize if innermost loops extent is not multiple of the vector length.\r\n\r\n**What was done:**\r\nCore changes: it checks current loops nest, if all loops are \"simple\", i.e. loops without annotations, bindings, reduce axis, then it does the following:\r\n 1) Fuse all loops into single one.\r\n 2) Split this new loop into 2 parts: inner and outer. Herewith split factor for the inner loop is equal to '_max_vectorize_extent_' MetaScheduler parameter.\r\n 3) Parallelize outer loop and vectorize inner loop.\r\n\r\n**Performance measurement**:\r\nMeasurement was done on Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. As it was expected, 1 and 2 got significant performance boost, 3 and 4 - without changes.\r\n\r\nN |    op   | Dtype |      Shape       | Before fix, ms | After fix, ms | speedup

we only classify whether the runtime module is DSO-exportable.\r\n\r\nThis PR further classifies each runtime module into the properties as follows:\r\n- `kBinarySerializable`: we can serialize the module to the stream of bytes. CUDA/OpenCL/JSON runtime are representative examples.\r\n- `kRunnable`: we can run the module directly. LLVM/CUDA/JSON runtime, executors (e.g, virtual machine) runtimes are runnable. Non-runnable modules, such as CSourceModule, requires a few extra steps (e.g,. compilation, link) to make it runnable.\r\n- `kBinaryExportable`: when the module is kBinarySerializable and kRunnable, we consider this module as binary exportable. A binary exportable module can be integrated into final runtime artifact by being serialized as data into the artifact, then deserialzied at runtime. This class of modules must implement `SaveToBinary`, and have a matching deserializer registered as `runtime.module.loadbinary_<type_key>`.\r\n- `kDSOExportable`: we can export the module as DSO. A DSO exportable module (e.g., a CSourceModuleNode of type_key 'c') can be incorporated into the final runtime artifact (ie shared library) by compilation and/or linking using the external compiler (llvm, nvcc, etc).

If you want to keep using an old checkpoint, please change your optimizer to <code>tf.keras.optimizer.legacy.XXX</code> (e.g. <code>tf.keras.optimizer.legacy.Adam</code>).</li>\n<li><strong>TF1 compatibility.</strong> The new optimizer, <code>tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer</code>, does not support TF1 any more, so please use the legacy optimizer <code>tf.keras.optimizer.legacy.XXX</code>. We highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate\">migrating your workflow to TF2</a> for stable support and new features.</li>\n<li><strong>Old optimizer API not found.</strong> The new optimizer, <code>tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer</code>, has a different set of public APIs from the old optimizer. These API changes are mostly related to getting rid of slot variables and TF1 support. Please check the API documentation to find alternatives to the missing API. If you must call the deprecated API, please change your optimizer to the legacy optimizer.</li>\n<li><strong>Learning rate schedule access.</strong> When using a <code>tf.keras.optimizers.schedules.LearningRateSchedule</code>, the new optimizer's <code>learning_rate</code> property returns the current learning rate value instead of a <code>LearningRateSchedule</code> object as before. If you need to access the <code>LearningRateSchedule</code> object, please use <code>optimizer._learning_rate</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>If you implemented a custom optimizer based on the old optimizer.</strong> Please set your optimizer to subclass <code>tf.keras.optimizer.legacy.XXX</code>. If you want to migrate to the new optimizer and find it does not support your optimizer, please file an issue in the <a href=\"https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues\">Keras GitHub repo</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Errors, such as <code>Cannot recognize variable...</code>.</strong> The new optimizer requires all optimizer variables to be created at the first <code>apply_gradients()</code> or <code>minimize()</code> call. If your workflow calls the optimizer to update different parts of the model in multiple stages, please call <code>optimizer.build(model.trainable_variables)</code> before the training loop.</li>\n<li><strong>Timeout or performance loss.</strong> We don't anticipate this to happen, but if you see such issues, please use the legacy optimizer, and file an issue in the Keras GitHub repo.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The old Keras optimizer will never be deleted, but will not see any new feature additions. New optimizers (for example, <code>tf.keras.optimizers.Adafactor</code>) will only be implemented based on the new <code>tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer</code> base class.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>tensorflow/python/keras</code> code is a legacy copy of Keras since the TensorFlow v2.7 release, and will be deleted in the v2.12 release. Please remove any import of <code>tensorflow.python.keras</code> and use the public API with <code>from tensorflow import keras</code> or <code>import tensorflow as tf; tf.keras</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Major Features and Improvements</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

some cases we must use SSA for textures loading but we didn't do\r\nthat. Example of such cases:\r\n1. Storing texture (NCHW4c) directly (w/o temporary buffer) to the\r\n   output buffer (NCHW). In this case we have to use SSA because we\r\n   need to get only one channel from the pixel. In case of storing to\r\n   the local buffer the SSA was used because the buffer was allocated\r\n   in kernel and the logic was written that if the buffer was allocated\r\n   then we should use SSA. But if we store the same texture directly to\r\n   the output buffer then SSA wasn't used and this OpenCL code wasn't\r\n   compiled.\r\n2. Casting texture (NCHW4c) to another data type and then storing it to\r\n   the buffer (NCHW). The SSA for textures was disabled in case of cast\r\n   operation. As a result it was necessary to take a channel from the\r\n   pixel but we got the vector data type (e.g. float4) and then we\r\n   tried to cast it to scalar data type.

this PR, I am beginning to implement the tracking of function purity as part of the `StructInfo` system. This will allow the compiler to enforce that no impure function (one that can possibly have visible side effects) can be called in a `DataflowBlock`. Tracking this requires noting which operators are pure or impure (I am presently doing this with an operator attribute called `FPurity`, a simple boolean), though dealing with calls to other Relax functions means that this information must also be tracked via the `StructInfo` system. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, it is difficult to infer the purity of a function in the general case (when there are calls to other Relax functions), so this change does require users to annotate impure functions using a new field on functions, `is_pure` (in TVMScript, this can be done using `R.is_pure()` or `R.is_impure()`). Since most Relax functions are likely to be pure and purity is the default assumption, this will hopefully not be a large imposition on users. We can consider inferring purity in the easier cases, since those are likely to be common.\r\n\r\nNote that `PackedFunc`s are conservatively treated as impure. However, in situations where they are needed inside a dataflow block, a call to a `PackedFunc` that is, in reality, pure can be done via the new operator `call_pure_packed` or the existing operator `call_dps_packed` (it is assumed that any `PackedFunc` used with it will be pure). (Similarly, a new operator `invoke_pure_closure` is introduced as a counterpart to `invoke_closure` for dealing with closure objects, though this really should only come up with the `LambdaLifting` pass.)\r\n\r\nAs an \"escape hatch\" to the purity system, one can use the attribute `relax.force_pure`, which indicates to the compiler to treat the entire function as pure even if it contains an impure call. Additionally, even though `PackedFunc`s are normally treated as impure, a user can use `call_pure_packed` or `call_dps_packed` to call `PackedFunc`s in dataflow blocks when appropriate. These can be used to deal with the following situations:\r\n1. A function does side effects but only on a value that will not be exposed anywhere else or on a new value that will be returned. Even though the individual actions are \"impure,\" the overall function fulfills the definition of being pure. `relax.force_pure` would be useful here.\r\n2. A `PackedFunc` is, in reality, pure. `call_pure_packed` or `call_dps_packed` are useful in this situation.\r\n\r\nChanges include:\r\n* Enforcing that impure functions are not used in `DataflowBlock`s in the well-formed check.\r\n* Enforcing that functions that are not labeled impure do not contain impure calls (unless `relax.force_pure` is set).\r\n* Implementing the `call_pure` operator\r\n\r\nStill to be done:\r\n- [x] Label purity for all operators\r\n- [x] Address certain tricky bugs\r\n\r\n(Also address the design concerns below)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe process of implementing purity tracking has revealed a few issues that may require some further design discussion.\r\n\r\n## Labeling purity or impurity\r\n\r\nUsing function attributes to label purity/impurity seems very messy. It might be worth making this part of the `Function` node's AST to avoid having to wrangle attributes in many places in the codebase.\r\n\r\n## ~~The treatment of `call_pure`~~\r\n\r\n~~`call_pure` presents a dilemma because many passes look for calls to certain operators, but with `call_pure`, these would be \"wrapped\" like so: `Call(Op(\"relay.call_pure\"), [inner_op, arg1, ..., argn], attrs, sinfo_args)`. In the posted PR, many passes needed to be revised to look for instances of `call_pure` so that they could be treated the same as calls to ordinary operators. It might cause less disruption to passes to turn `call_pure` into a specialized AST node that literally wraps a call node. This way visitors or mutators could have an easy default case and the lower-level code generation passes could simply ignore the `call_pure` node and deal with the wrapped call. As painful as introducing a new AST node would be, it would likely be more maintainable than having every pass have to have a special case for the `call_pure` operator.~~\r\n\r\nThe more restricted `call_pure_packed`/`invoke_pure_closure` are less likely to come up in passes and so are less likely to need special handling.\r\n\r\n## Staging\r\n\r\nRelated to the above issue, having purity tracking in the well-formedness analysis means that even low-level passes like `VMLowerBuiltin`, which replaces some Relax operators with `PackedFunc`s (treated as impure by default, as they are in principle dangerous black boxes), have to insert calls to `call_pure` to avoid triggering purity errors. Perhaps it might be useful to ignore purity by the time we reach lower stages of compilation, much as the `ToNonDataflow` pass is used in the VM build process to eliminate `DataflowBlock`s.\r\n\r\n**Update**: Based on the TVM Unity Community Meeting on Mar. 28, 2023, I've provisionally adopted a variant of this approach thanks to a suggestion by @tqchen. Namely, there is a pass called `RemovePurityChecking` that simply adds the `ForcePure` attribute to all pure functions and unwraps all invocations of `call_pure_packed`, `call_pure_dps_packed`, and `invoke_pure_closure`. This allows lower-level passes to remain unchanged and not to have to consider purity at all. It is inserted after `ToNonDataflow` in the `build()` function in `vm_build.py`.\r\n\r\n**Update 2**: Thanks to suggestions by @tqchen, I've made `is_pure` and `force_pure` into fields on functions rather than attributes and added syntactic sugar in TVMScript to make these easy to set.\r\n\r\n**Update 3**: Per @tqchen's suggestion `force_pure` will be kept as an attribute instead. This is because it acts more as a direction to the compiler rather than an inherent property of a function.","created_at":"2023-03-24T03:38:43Z","updated_at":"2023-05-18T19:20:15Z","closed_at":"2023-05-18T19:20:15Z","merged_at":"2023-05-18T19:20:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"7aff6bfbb0a6c383923dad0ee11565731bfef78b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":5079055615,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBDeBdM8AAAABLrw8_w","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/branch:%20unity","name":"branch:
