the default compiler is nvrtc, but as soon as you import tvm.autotvm, it forces the use of nvcc.\r\n\r\nIt is currently very hard to go back to nvrtc from python since there are no exposed API to remove a registered hook nor there are hooks to compile using nvrtc.  The docstring for the hook seems to suggest that nvcc generates better code than nvrtc, which I haven't found to be the case since cuda 8.0 or so. So I propose that autotvm stops forcing nvcc. It's still possible for people to set the hook if they want it.\r\n\r\nIf that is unacceptable, then I could make another PR to expose the API to remove hooks so that I can use

PR moves some passes from to the pass manager. The summary of the changes:\r\n\r\n- to a normal form implicitly modifies the module but only returns an updated expr. This may cause problems since some updated functions in the module might be lost. I changed to it a module pass that returns a module to avoid losing information.\r\n\r\n- Some unit tests in DCE don't have typing info. We can run `Expr -> Expr` opts on this them without types. However, as relay is strongly typed (at least everything in a module should be strongly typed), this PR adds types to them.\r\n\r\n- Partial Evaluation seems to need some more work for moving into the pass infra. I think it should be a module pass because it could evaluate the functions and then apply DCE to delete some of the dead ones. It looks to me we might need a global DCE pass to work on the module level and be able to delete functions. Otherwise, we might need to rely on inlining and outlining. \r\n\r\ncc @jroesch @tqchen @MarisaKirisame @wweic @icemelon9 @slyubomirsky

in order to compile models we usually call\r\nfunc, params = relay.frontend.from_<framework>(model_artifact, shape, ...)\r\n\r\n# and then we call\r\ngraph, lib, params = relay.build(func, target, params=params)\r\n```\r\nRecently it was a change which changes `from_<framework>` output to return `mod` instead of `func` #3353\r\nBut `relay.build` still supports `func` as an input. This is why all existing users' scripts to compile models should be updated. All people need to add extra line to their scripts before `relay.build`\r\n```\r\nfunc = mod[mod.entry_func]\r\n```\r\nIn order to avoid all people fixing their compile scripts I think we need to add

DWARF debug information. This allows us to set breakpoints on these generated functions, inspect arguments, show reasonable names in AOT mode in profiling tools, etc. There's a subsequent `perf` PR upcoming from Bram which augments this with support for Linux `perf`'s [jit interface](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/perf/Documentation/jit-interface.txt), which makes `perf` work in JIT scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is fairly straightforward - for every LoweredFunc, we emit DWARF information for the function, it's signature, and it's arguments.

add the first AVX512VNNI instruction support in TVM in this PR.\r\n\r\nTo compute the intrinsics kernels of uint8 * int8 -> accumulation int32,\r\n- Originally, we need the following instructions:\r\n```\r\nvpmaddubsw zmm28, zmm31, zmm30\r\nvpmaddwd zmm28, zmm29, zmm28\r\nvpaddd zmm0, zmm28, zmm0\r\n```\r\n\r\n- After this PR with AVX512 VNNI, we only need the following instructions:\r\n```\r\nvpdpbusd zmm0, zmm31, zmm30\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe benchmark the current TVM with the benchmark routine on an Intel Cascade Lake machine (Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5220 CPU @ 2.20GHz ) in this PR:\r\nThe theoretical peak performance for this Intel Cascade Lake machine is ~**280** Gops/s with Turbo off.\r\n\r\n- Before this PR:\r\n> Tensorization: running time: 15.545 ms, **138.14** Gops/s, effiency: 0.49\r\n\r\n- After this PR:\r\n> Tensorization: running time: 10.443 ms, **205.64** Gops/s, effiency: 0.73\r\n\r\nAs a reference, for our current ongoing PR (https://github.com/pytorch/FBGEMM/pull/111), FBGEMM can achieve ~**252** Gops/s. The measured performance for MKL-DNN compiled in GCC is similar. As pointed out by @were in the comments below, the reason is that in the current implementation in this PR, we didn't fully utilize the accumulation in `vpdpbusd` instruction.\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-18T07:36:18Z","updated_at":"2019-10-11T23:35:22Z","closed_at":"2019-09-13T20:27:41Z","merged_at":"2019-09-13T20:27:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"bb82e09f9c38e65a62f416e4b4600375fb50a839","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

multi-threaded applications where we have multiple inferences on the\r\nsame model in parallel (consider e.g. a TTS system handling multiple\r\nrequests), it can be useful to share the parameters of a model amongst\r\nthese multiple instances. This improves the cache utilization behaviour\r\nof the system, as multiple cores can use the same set of weights instead\r\nof evicting the identical copies of weights in a shared cache.\r\n\r\nAs the underlying `NDArray` instances in `data_entry_` implement a\r\nref-counted based sharing system, this is a simple modification of the\r\n`GraphRuntime::LoadParams` logic to instead copy parameters from an\r\nexisting GraphRuntime instance. This is a little ugly in that we need\r\nboth the pre-existing GraphRuntime instance, as well as the 'serialized'\r\nparams (since we need to know the set of names we should copy), but\r\nwithout imposing additional assumptions (i.e. storing the set of param\r\nnames in GraphRuntime, and enforcing that shared param names are\r\nidentical to the parameters set in the preceding `LoadParams` call),\r\nthis seems unavoidable.\r\n\r\nTest Plan:\r\n\r\nUnit test added.","created_at":"2019-06-17T20:24:55Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T04:06:47Z","closed_at":"2019-06-25T04:06:20Z","merged_at":"2019-06-25T04:06:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"32be34a07f72e1ac008b385a07ca1cb66ec59e6e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

#3299 changed the representation of `ConstructorValue` to rely on the ADT tag rather than a constructor object, I wrote this change to ensure that\r\n1. it would be easy to get back a constructor given the tag and\r\n2. tags could be reasonably guaranteed to be globally unique\r\n\r\nPreviously tags simply consisted of the constructor's index in the typedata array, but this means that constructors for different ADTs could have clashing tags. Here I use the hash of the ADT name (guaranteed to be globally unique by the module) and the index to produce the tag for the constructor. The module also keeps a reverse mapping of tags to constructors to make it easy to retrieve.\r\n\r\nI followed the example of the structural hash in passing around the hashed values and I hope I have done so correctly. I have added some round-trip tests to ensure that hashes map back to the same constructors each time.

- Act as medium of discussion for pull request #2351\r\n\r\n**The patch only supports Symmetric quantization for now. The goal is to focus on infrastructure and not on the low-level details of what operations should be used for the computations. Once, we finalize the infra, we can tackle the low-level details.**\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n- New quantized conv2D op in Relay\r\n- Python API interface to instantiate the Relay op\r\n- Infer Type implemented\r\n- Lowering of quantized_conv op to low-level Relay ops\r\n\r\nDiscussion points\r\n- Does the namespace look correct?\r\n    - Relay op is called 'relay.op.nn._quantize.quantized_conv2d'\r\n    - Idea is that any op under '_quantize' namespace will go through rewrite.\r\n- How to tackle redundant code? Should we reuse Conv2DRel and Conv2DAttrs?\r\n    - Tried protoyping. Found it hard to derive from Conv2DAttr struct\r\n    - Infer Type has a param field. This need to come from the right datatype.\r\n\r\nMissing implememtation\r\n    - Lowering of quantized conv into conv+cast is incomplete.\r\n    - Will work on it async. This is orthogonal to the discussion.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!   Please refer to guideline https://docs.tvm.ai/contribute/ for useful information and tips.

relay's python pass decorator(```transform.module_pass```, ```transform.function_pass```) decorates functions. \r\n\r\nHowever, one typical use-case of the customized pass is parameterized pipelines.\r\nThe example below is one made-up use-case when a user wants to customize the behavior of the pipeline by setting a customization flag(```enable_fold```).\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# object style parameterized pass.\r\n@relay.transform.module_pass\r\nclass CustomPipeline:\r\n    def __init__(self, enable_fold):\r\n        self.enable_fold = enable_fold\r\n        self.cse = relay.transform.EliminateCommonSubexpr()\r\n        self.const_fold = relay.transform.FoldConstant()\r\n\r\n    def transform_module(self, mod, ctx):\r\n          mod = self.cse(mod, ctx)\r\n          if self.enable_fold:\r\n              mod = self.const_fold(mod, ctx)\r\n          return mod\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR enables this kind of decoration. That decorate CustomPipeline into a new class that is a subclass of ModulePass, and enables its usage as a ModulePass.\r\n\r\nNote that, however, we can certainly reach a similar solution using functional style programming along with the old API(see the code below). \r\n```python\r\n# funcitonal style parameterized pass.\r\ndef CustomizePipeline(enable_fold):\r\n      cse = relay.transform.EliminateCommonSubexpr()\r\n      const_fold = relay.transform.FoldConstant()\r\n      def transform_module(mod, ctx)\r\n            mod = cse(mod, ctx)\r\n            if enable_fold:\r\n                mod = const_fold(mod, ctx)\r\n            return mod\r\n     return relay.transform.module_pass(transform_module)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it was really a debate about which style that a user might prefer(FP vs objects) and what will happen as the pipeline gets more complicated. By talking to folks, the feedback that I get so far is:\r\n\r\n- If the parameterization behavior is simple, functional style seems to be more succinct\r\n- If there are a lot of local states, member functions, as the pipeline becomes more complicated, class style might be preferred.\r\n- One notable fact: most deep learning frameworks' compositional API use the class style, possibly due to the need to override multiple functions.\r\n\r\nAfter considering these facts, I think it might be helpful to enable the object style of writing customized passes. So that certain customized pipelines like Quantization might take benefit from this improvement.\r\n\r\ncc @jroesch @ZihengJiang @zhiics @eqy @MarisaKirisame @yzhliu @icemelon9

\r\n\r\nThis PR returns `Module` instead of `Expr` from the frontend converters because:\r\n1) As we move to pass manager the optimizations should usually be `Module` to `Module`\r\n2) If the converters need to work on modules, i.e. containing more than one functions, returning `Expr` could be error-prone. Or we should really return a function with closures. Returning module should be more convenient.\r\n\r\nNecessary changes are made in various executors to take both module and expr.\r\n\r\nCovered converters:\r\n\r\n- [x] TensorFlow\r\n\r\n- [x]
