to this commit, if a TIR variable was required to compute the output of `BlockBuilder.call_te`, but that TIR variable could not be inferred from the shape of any tensor arguments, it would be provided in an optional `tir_vars` argument to `R.call_tir`.  In C++, this would be then be accessed as an optional\r\n`call->args[2].as<ShapeExprNode>()`.\r\n\r\nThis extra argument can cause unexpected bugs.  For example, the bug that was fixed in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/17086 was caused by `RewriteDataflowReshape` identifying the output buffer using `prim_func->buffer_map.Get(prim_func->params.back())`, which is only correct if `tir_vars` is empty.  Rather than fixing these issues as they come up, it would be better to make the general Relax guarantees stronger by removing the `tir_vars` argument altogether.\r\n\r\nUse of extra `R.shape` parameter to specify additional `tir_vars` predates the existence of `relax::PrimValue`, and is no longer required.  This commit updates `BlockBuilder.call_te` to use additional `relax.PrimValue` arguments to handle symbolic values that cannot be inferred from tensor shapes, rather than

Relax transform `RewriteDataflowReshape` identifies TIR functions that are equivalent to `relax.op.reshape`, and replaces them with calls to `relax.op.reshape`.  This is used as a precursor for simplifications that rely on the high-level knowledge that an operator is a reshape, but also require the low-level knowledge of the adjacent TIR PrimFuncs.\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit, the `RewriteDataflowReshape` pass would only recognize static shapes, or dynamic shapes that could be inferred from the shapes of tensor arguments.

to this commit, all symbolic variables were printed identically, regardless of whether the underlying variable was a `tir.Var` or `tir.SizeVar`.  As a result, numeric simplifications that rely on a `tir.SizeVar` being non-negative may be skipped after a round-trip through TVMScript.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the TVMScript printing and parsing of Relax functions to use `var = T.int64(is_size_var=True)` for `tir.SizeVar`, matching how `tir.SizeVar` is parsed for TIR functions.  As an added benefit, this also allows Relax functions `R.Prim` arguments other than `int64` to be benefit.  This may be useful in the future, such as to specify the fill value for

to use 16x32 spatial x reduction thread extents regardless of workload size. This works around a lowering bug which I haven't tracked down yet. \r\n\r\nCurrently when the spatial dimension is larger than the reduction dimension, it uses a 4x64 thread layout. This implies two warps in the reduction dimension corresponding to blockDim.x=64. An illegal cuda instruction is encountered in the second warp during the __shfl_down_sync for the remainder portion of the computation (as a result of the rfactor, I believe). AFAICT the mask calculation used for this remainder shfl is incorrect and is causing the error. Specifically it occurs on the first thread of the second warp (two warps along x since blockDim.x = 64)\r\n\r\nThis is the relevant cuda causing the error:\r\n```\r\nif (((int)threadIdx.x) < 2) {\r\n    red_buf0[0] = red_buf_staging[((((int)threadIdx.y) * 2) + ((int)threadIdx.x))];\r\n  }\r\n  mask[0] = (__activemask() & ((uint)(3 << (((int)threadIdx.y) * 2)))); // <<< likely the problem\r\n  t0[0] = __shfl_down_sync(mask[0], red_buf0[0], 1, 32);\r\n  red_buf0[0] = (red_buf0[0] + t0[0]);\r\n  if (((int)threadIdx.x) == 0) {\r\n    ((volatile half*)red_result)[((int)threadIdx.y)] = red_buf0[0];\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\nThe corresponding sass where the illegal instruction occurs:\r\n```\r\n   0x00007d9e97b92490 <+1936>:  WARPSYNC.ALL\r\n   0x00007d9e97b924a0 <+1952>:  BAR.SYNC.DEFER_BLOCKING 0x0\r\n   0x00007d9e97b924b0 <+1968>:  @!P1 VIADD R13, R5, 0x8\r\n   0x00007d9e97b924c0 <+1984>:  @!P1 LEA R7, R17, R14, 0x1\r\n   0x00007d9e97b924d0 <+2000>:  @!P1 PRMT R6, R2, 0x654, R13\r\n   0x00007d9e97b924e0 <+2016>:  @!P1 LEA R7, R7, R6, 0x1\r\n   0x00007d9e97b924f0 <+2032>:  @!P1 LDS.U16 R16, [R7]\r\n   0x00007d9e97b92500 <+2048>:  IMAD.MOV.U32 R6, RZ, RZ, 0x3\r\n   0x00007d9e97b92510 <+2064>:  SHF.L.U32 R17, R17, 0x1, RZ\r\n   0x00007d9e97b92520 <+2080>:  VOTEU.ANY UR4, UPT, PT\r\n   0x00007d9e97b92530 <+2096>:  SHF.L.U32 R3, R6, R17, RZ\r\n   0x00007d9e97b92540 <+2112>:  LOP3.LUT R3, R3, UR4, RZ, 0xc0, !PT\r\n   0x00007d9e97b92550 <+2128>:  ISETP.NE.AND P0, PT, R14, RZ, PT\r\n   0x00007d9e97b92560 <+2144>:  PRMT R2, R2, 0x654, R5\r\n   0x00007d9e97b92570 <+2160>:  PRMT R4, R16, 0x5410, R16\r\n*> 0x00007d9e97b92580 <+2176>:  WARPSYNC R3\r\n=> 0x00007d9e97b92590 <+2192>:  SHFL.DOWN PT, R3, R4, 0x1, 0x1f\r\n   0x00007d9e97b925a0 <+2208>:  IMAD.IADD R17, R17, 0x1, R2\r\n   0x00007d9e97b925b0 <+2224>:  HADD2 R16, R16.H0_H0, R3.H0_H0\r\n   0x00007d9e97b925c0 <+2240>:  @!P0 STS.U16 [R17], R16\r\n   0x00007d9e97b925d0 <+2256>:  WARPSYNC.ALL\r\n   0x00007d9e97b925e0 <+2272>:  BAR.SYNC.DEFER_BLOCKING 0x0\r\n```\r\n  \r\nChanging the thread extents to 16x32 (one warp along the reduction dimension) works around the issue.

is a follow-up commit to\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/16637, which updated `relax.transform.FuseOps` to provide additional parameters defining symbolic variables required by the fused functions.  While this ensures that `relax.transform.FuseOps` produces well-formed Relax functions, these additional arguments can break some kernel implementations.\r\n\r\nThis commit implements a new transform\r\n`RemoveSymbolicExpressionsInSubroutine` to resolve this issue.  This transform identifies function arguments whose sole purpose is to compute a symbolic expression, when that symbolic expression could be inferred from tensor shapes.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider the following Relax function:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef func(\r\n    data: R.Tensor([\"batch_size * seq_len\", \"hidden_size\"]),\r\n    weights: R.Tensor([\"hidden_size\", \"intermediate_size\"]),\r\n    dummy_arg: R.Shape([\"batch_size\", \"seq_len\"]),\r\n  ) -> R.Tensor([\"batch_size * seq_len\", \"intermediate_size\"]):\r\n\r\n    batch_size = T.int64()\r\n    seq_len = T.int64()\r\n    intermediate_size = T.int64()\r\n    hidden_size = T.int64()\r\n\r\n    output: R.Tensor([batch_size * seq_len, intermediate_size]) = R.matmul(data, weights)\r\n    return output\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `data` tensor may be used to infer `hidden_size`, but cannot be used to infer `batch_size` or `seq_len`.  The `R.Shape` parameter exists solely to define `batch_size` and `seq_len`, since all symbolic variables must be defined.  However, neither `batch_size` nor `seq_len` are ever used outside of the expression `batch_size * seq_len`, and the value of `batch_size * seq_len` could be inferred from the shape of the `data` tensor.\r\n\r\nThis new transform identifies cases where an argument is otherwise unnecessary, and replaces the symbolic expression with a new argument.  This makes the `dummy_arg: R.Shape` be entirely unused, so a later use of `relax.transform.RemoveUnusedParameters()` can remove the parameter altogether.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@R.function\r\ndef func(\r\n    data: R.Tensor([\"data_dim0\", \"hidden_size\"]),\r\n    weights: R.Tensor([\"hidden_size\", \"intermediate_size\"]),\r\n    dummy_arg: R.Shape([\"batch_size\", \"seq_len\"]),\r\n

of cmake 3.29.5 [0], if the NVCC version is 11 or higher, cmake will generate a \"options-file.rsp\" containing the -I flags for include directories, rather than providing them on the command-line.  This setting exists to work around the short command-line length limits on Windows, but is enabled on all platforms.  If set, because include directories are not part of the `compile_commands.json`, the clangd LSP cannot find the include files.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this override cannot be specified in a user's `config.cmake` for TVM, because it must be set after CMake's built-in CUDA support.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates TVM's `CUDA.cmake` to override the `CMAKE_CUDA_USE_RESPONSE_FILE_FOR_INCLUDES` variable,

to this commit, allocations performed by `ncclCommInitRank` had no corresponding call to `ncclCommDestroy`.  While `ncclCommDestroy` does occur in the `CCLThreadLocalContext::Clear` method, there are no calls into this method.  On worker processes, the failure to call `ncclCommDestroy` typically had little effect.  Any destruction would occur shortly before the process closes, and so resources would be reclaimed by the OS when the process terminates.\r\n\r\nHowever, worker0 of a Disco session is a separate thread, rather than a separate process.  While this allows it to easily receive data from the controller thread, resources allocated by worker0 are not reclaimed by the OS until the entire process terminates.  As a result, the `CCLThreadLocalContext` leaked GPU memory, as the `ncclCommInitRank` call at the start of each\r\n`tvm.runtime.disco.ProcessSession` was never de-allocated.  The increase in GPU memory usage was about 1 gigabyte for each `ProcessSession`.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `CCLThreadLocalContext` to have a destructor that calls the `Clear` method.  For worker0, this is called when the thread is joined to the main thread.","created_at":"2024-06-10T13:37:02Z","updated_at":"2024-06-13T11:50:37Z","closed_at":"2024-06-12T23:44:51Z","merged_at":"2024-06-12T23:44:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"0984e97a5c799c7db961ffb2d427ee923eccb607","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17078/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17078/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17078/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/25de533b79e1c91ae8af7591ce8586fc507be7cf","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:nccl_cleanup_ccl_resources","ref":"nccl_cleanup_ccl_resources","sha":"25de533b79e1c91ae8af7591ce8586fc507be7cf","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, an operator's `FCallPacked` attribute, used to specify a 1:1 mapping between a relax operator and a `PackedFunc` that implements it, was only checked in `CodegenVM`.  Any operator with `FCallPacked` would raise an error when compiled using `CodegenVMTIR`.\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the `FCallPacked` handling from `CodegenVM` altogether, and instead checks for this attribute as part of `LegalizeOps`.  This provides the same functionality across both

to this commit, the matmul and conv2d schedules required padding of the inputs to some multiple of vscale and a final \"unpadding\" stage.\r\n\r\nInstead, we can leverage predicated operations to avoid the the requirement for padding. Both the transpose interleave and outer product fp32 intrinsics are updated to use predication. The `get_active_lane_mask` intrinsic is utilized to generate a variably sized mask of active lanes depending on the global position the tensor intrinsic is operating on.\r\n\r\nFor now this relies on using `offset_of` and `stride` information from the tensor we're predicating an access on. Likely we will want to build on this in the future with a more intuitive API for determining the current tile location.\r\n\r\nSupport for batched conv2d was removed since this causes numerical issues which is suspected to be due to how the current tile is determined (paragraph above).\r\n\r\n~Note: this should not be merged until after https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/17048~\r\n\r\ncc @ekalda

With this fix, the PagedKVCache now supports removing sequences in any order without breaking.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds an `empty` function to PagedKVCache to check if the KV cache is empty. Right now this function is only used for test purpose, where we check if everything in the KV cache is freed after removing all

to this commit, the `support::OrderedSet<T>` utility used the default copy constructor and copy assignment, which would copy both the `OrderedSet::elements_` and `OrderedSet::elem_to_iter_` members. While this is the correct behavior for `elements_`, the copy of `elem_to_iter_` would contain references to the original's `element_`, rather than to its own.\r\n\r\nWhile `elem_to_iter_` is used in both `OrderedSet::push_back` and `OrderedSet::erase`, the implementation of `OrderedSet::push_back` only depends on the keys used in `elem_to_iter_`, and does not depend on the values stored.  As a result, this bug could go undetected for append-only usage, which is the most frequent use of `OrderedSet`.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `support::OrderedSet` to have an explicit copy constructor and copy assignment.  Only the `std::list<T> elements_` member may be copied, while the `elem_to_iter_` must instead be

to this commit, variable replacement by `BindSymbolicVars` would fail to replace variables that occur within a `relax::MatchCast` node. This pattern is rare, because the `bind_symbolic_vars` method can only replace variables that are exposed as part of the function signature, and most uses of `relax::MatchCast` act as a definition for symbolic variables that are not exposed through the function signature.  This pattern is well-formed, though, since the `relax::MatchCast` node can also act as a user of previously-defined symbolic variables.\r\n\r\nThe root cause for this bug was in the `ExprMutator` visitor for `relax::MatchCast`, which did not visit the struct info field.  As a result, the virtual `ExprMutator::VisitPrimExpr` function was not called for expressions that occur within the `StructInfo` of a `relax::MatchCast`.  This commit updates `ExprMutator` to resolve this bug, and applies an analogous fix for `ExprVisitor`.","created_at":"2024-05-28T13:34:13Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T14:29:41Z","closed_at":"2024-05-28T23:52:01Z","merged_at":"2024-05-28T23:52:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"b2c61162f006504b192493e9ceeac9b89a87da65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17034/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17034/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17034/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/555f55b771eb95fc2399b05cf48bb095b1c4333f","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_bugfix_bind_symbolic_vars_in_match_cast","ref":"relax_bugfix_bind_symbolic_vars_in_match_cast","sha":"555f55b771eb95fc2399b05cf48bb095b1c4333f","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

`ComputePrimValue` transform is used to compute the value of symbolic expressions that may appear within a Relax function.  For example, to compute a boolean condition used for a `relax::If` node. These functions are used for small host-side computations, prior to launching a device kernel.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates `ComputePrimValue` to annotate the generated `PrimFunc` with `tir::attr::kIsHostFunc`.  This annotation is required for correct behavior in `tvm.dlight.ApplyDefaultSchedule`, to avoid erroneous scheduling of this function for the GPU, and for `tir::transform::BindTarget`, to ensure that the function is compiled for execution on the host.","created_at":"2024-05-28T13:27:48Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T14:29:38Z","closed_at":"2024-05-29T00:49:20Z","merged_at":"2024-05-29T00:49:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"c9d87ef54fbba29b16a0a8420fb61c669808a256","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17032/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17032/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17032/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/2d3300c2bd3aac4137e3cb44e82bce46c74ab925","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_bugfix_annotate_compute_prim_value_as_host","ref":"relax_bugfix_annotate_compute_prim_value_as_host","sha":"2d3300c2bd3aac4137e3cb44e82bce46c74ab925","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, variable replacement by `BindSymbolicVars` would fail to replace variables that occur within a `relax::MatchCast` node. This pattern is rare, because the `bind_symbolic_vars` method can only replace variables that are exposed as part of the function signature, and most uses of `relax::MatchCast` act as a definition for symbolic variables that are not exposed through the function signature.  This pattern is well-formed, though, since the `relax::MatchCast` node can also act as a user of previously-defined symbolic variables.\r\n\r\nThe root cause for this bug was in the `ExprMutator` visitor for `relax::MatchCast`, which did not visit the struct info field.  As a result, the virtual `ExprMutator::VisitPrimExpr` function was not called for expressions that occur within the `StructInfo` of a `relax::MatchCast`.  This commit updates `ExprMutator` to resolve this bug, and applies an analogous fix for `ExprVisitor`.","created_at":"2024-05-23T15:50:48Z","updated_at":"2024-05-29T14:29:42Z","closed_at":"2024-05-28T13:34:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"61effd1143a610c797624f2811daf83cf5cbb129","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/555f55b771eb95fc2399b05cf48bb095b1c4333f","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:relax_bugfix_bind_symbolic_vars_in_match_cast","ref":"relax_bugfix_bind_symbolic_vars_in_match_cast","sha":"555f55b771eb95fc2399b05cf48bb095b1c4333f","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

BYOC,  Marvell Compiler Config node defines the target compiler's  command line options, along with default values. When the user has not given any explicit command line options, these default values can be extracted from the configuration and passed to the TVM's Argument Parser.  Currently the support for extraction of default values from Config options is not there, this change introduces that support. Also this is done conditionally by interpreting the flag status of target compiler.

However, there are two loops with extent 12 and 4, which are not equal\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe root cause is, the Batch Loop will be treated the same way as the other two spacial loops, M and N Loops, the Batch Loop will be decomposed following the SSSRRSRS fashion. But `MultiLevelTilingTensorCoreNode::TransformIntermediateOutputLayout` has the assumption that the inner most two S should only have M and N loops' segments, which causes that, the following `AddWriteReuseTensorCore` adds an \"wmma.accumulator\" cache write block, and fuses some loop vars, which only belong to M and N Loops, and binds them to \"threadIdx.y\".  But the previous, also the first, fused loop bound to \"threadIdx.y\" contains Batch Loop's segment. So the inconsistency arises.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple, just skip the outer Batch Loop from sample_perfect_tile process and fuse it into \"blockIdx.y\".\r\n\r\nActually I also tried more complex strategy that decomposes Batch Loop into SSS, with each segment binds to \"blockIdx.y\" \"blockIdx.x\" \"threadIdx.y\" separately, so inner most two Ss contain no Batch Loop segment. But this strategy is less performant for several typical workload. I think that's because `AddWriteReuseTensorCore` will reorder the inner loop var across the Batch Loop segment, which cause less data locality.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow I also paste the trace before the fix (including postproc trace), you can replay it line by line and print the each loop extent to verify the inconsistency.\r\n```\r\nb0 = sch.get_block(name=\"T_batch_matmul_NT\",

to this commit, use of the `disco.Session` API to broadcast or scatter an array required several steps from the caller.\r\n\r\n1. Allocate memory on worker0\r\n2. Transfer data from the controller to worker0\r\n3. Allocate memory on each worker\r\n4. Broadcast/scatter data from worker0 to all workers\r\n\r\nWhile exposing these steps is necessary for performance, especially when used repeatedly, it can be tedious/error-prone to use for initialization that is only performed once.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds utility methods `Session.broadcast` and `Session.scatter`, which are implemented in terms of the existing lower-level methods `Session.broadcast_from_worker0` and `Session.scatter_from_worker0`.  These methods perform the transfer from the controller to worker0, and from worker0 to all other workers.","created_at":"2024-05-20T14:39:19Z","updated_at":"2024-05-28T13:51:39Z","closed_at":"2024-05-28T13:51:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"346957b480af7cbbcceeb19b597dd35ffd700e10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/3db94d52485d98e14256788ba73802d57be56db8","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:disco_broadcast_scatter_utility_methods","ref":"disco_broadcast_scatter_utility_methods","sha":"3db94d52485d98e14256788ba73802d57be56db8","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this PR, WebGPU errors such as OOM are only logged as a warning without affecting the program. This PR handles WebGPU error using `pushErrorScope()` and `popErrorScope()` following https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb/blob/main/design/ErrorHandling.md. \r\n\r\nWe replace `createBuffer()` with `tryCreateBuffer()`, in which we catch all three types of errors. For now, we treat any error occurred in `createBuffer()` fatal and hence do `device.destroy()`. When a device is initiated, we use `device.lost.then()` to listen to the event of `device.destroy()`, upon which we log the error and call `Instance.dispose()`, prompting the user to re-initialize.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm/issues/356 for motivation.\r\n\r\nTested end-to-end with WebLLM.","created_at":"2024-05-17T09:36:00Z","updated_at":"2024-05-17T16:41:58Z","closed_at":"2024-05-17T16:41:58Z","merged_at":"2024-05-17T16:41:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"afb64162342bc911cb101a5038139441cbbd8bbc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17005/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/17005/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/17005/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/7b98b31dbc4faf29111fc2379bc06df2676a3d03","head":{"label":"CharlieFRuan:pr-0517-web-oom","ref":"pr-0517-web-oom","sha":"7b98b31dbc4faf29111fc2379bc06df2676a3d03","user":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":717204711,"node_id":"R_kgDOKr-s5w","name":"tvm","full_name":"CharlieFRuan/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CharlieFRuan","id":53290280,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMjkwMjgw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/53290280?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan","html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CharlieFRuan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CharlieFRuan/tvm","description":"Open

commit adds a scalable `arm_cpu` conv2d NHWC schedule for fp32 which generates SME instructions by using the tensor intrinsics introduced in #16921.\r\n\r\nAlongside the SME schedule, the logic of the TE schedule `schedule_conv2d_gemm_native()` for both non-scalable and scalable vector implementations has also been translated into the new TIR schedule. This means that the TE compute definition `compute_conv2d_NHWC_hybrid()` is now compatible with both the original TE schedules (e.g. `schedule_conv2d_NHWC_hybrid()`) and the newly introduced TIR schedule `schedule_conv2d_NHWC_hybrid_TIR()`. The corresponding TOPI test has been extended to reflect that.\r\n\r\ncc @ekalda @lhutton1

to this commit, using `disco.Session` methods to transfer `NDArray` instances to workers could raise an exception if the `NDArray` is larger than the buffer allocated by the OS for the controller/worker pipe.  In these case, the first call to the `Read` method of `tvm::support::Pipe` would successfully return, but only with the initial bytes of the `NDArray`.  Receiving the full `NDArray` requires repeatedly calling the POSIX `read` function.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `Read` and `Write` methods of `tvm::support::Pipe` to repeatedly call the underlying read/write methods, until the full `NDArray` has been transferred.\r\n\r\nThis commit does not add any unit tests, as the existing unit test `tests/python/disco/test_ccl.py::test_attention[nccl-ProcessSession]` requires this change to pass.","created_at":"2024-05-13T15:09:02Z","updated_at":"2024-05-15T13:16:02Z","closed_at":"2024-05-14T14:39:16Z","merged_at":"2024-05-14T14:39:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9dbbc9154f947c989631e7a598152f0a045f9f2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16992/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16992/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16992/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/45f98390b5b8dfeabd73c8e1ceb01983a8613077","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:bugfix_disco_transfer_larger_than_pipe_buffer","ref":"bugfix_disco_transfer_larger_than_pipe_buffer","sha":"45f98390b5b8dfeabd73c8e1ceb01983a8613077","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, while the `num_workers` argument was provided to the `disco.Session` object, it could not be determined from an existing `disco.Session` object.  As a result, functions that interacted with a multi-GPU setup frequently required separate `num_workers` and `disco_session` argument, which could erroneously be out-of-sync (e.g. passing the incorrect `num_workers`, or omitting the `disco_session` argument when `num_workers>1`).\r\n\r\nTo remove this class of errors, this commit adds a `disco.Session.num_workers` property.  The separate `num_workers` argument is no longer necessary, as it can be determined from the `disco.Session` instance.","created_at":"2024-05-13T13:56:01Z","updated_at":"2024-05-13T17:23:43Z","closed_at":"2024-05-13T17:23:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ed0df9b6cb79e8cbc137ba3f44ec8bb63280413","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/25a2f95b1cdf314162871829d410382447766077","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:disco_query_num_workers","ref":"disco_query_num_workers","sha":"25a2f95b1cdf314162871829d410382447766077","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

to this commit, each disco worker needed to receive `DiscoAction::kShutdown` in order to close cleanly.  While this is sent from the destructor of `ProcessSessionObj`, which owns the worker processes, this does not guarantee that the disco workers will receive the shutdown command.  For example, the controller process holding the `ProcessSessionObj` may reach a timeout and be terminated, preventing it from sending the `DiscoAction::kShutdown` command.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the disco worker to check for a closed pipe that occurs between two packets, and to treat this as if the `DiscoAction::kShutdown` command were received.  A closed pipe that occurs at any other location is still treated as an error and reported.","created_at":"2024-05-13T13:52:09Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T14:39:04Z","closed_at":"2024-05-14T14:38:50Z","merged_at":"2024-05-14T14:38:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"93233a988e613bf6b6d70b093dedef2c294f949d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/863be2f739d300e590537223dc5056aea3036275","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:disco_perform_clean_shutdown_on_hangup","ref":"disco_perform_clean_shutdown_on_hangup","sha":"863be2f739d300e590537223dc5056aea3036275","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

is a patch for PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15473\r\nThat PR tried to solve the issues described in [RFC](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/improving-dataflow-pattern-matching-for-relay/15344), but introduced another issue, probably unintentionally.\r\nThe new issue occurs, when there are some leaf args of some OPs along the path during matching 'path' part for dominator pattern. For example, suppose we have a dominator pattern as follows:\r\n```python\r\n    conv2d_pat = is_op(\"nn.conv2d\")(wildcard(), wildcard())\r\n    eltwise_pat = (wildcard().has_attr({\"TOpPattern\": K_ELEMWISE}))(None)\r\n    broadcast_pat = (wildcard().has_attr({\"TOpPattern\": K_BROADCAST}))(None)\r\n    path_pat = eltwise_pat | broadcast_pat\r\n    injective_pat = (wildcard().has_attr({\"TOpPattern\": K_INJECTIVE}))(wildcard())\r\n    pattern = DominatorPattern(conv2d_pat, path_pat, injective_pat)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand we want to match the graph:\r\n```text\r\ninput  weight\r\n  \\     /\r\n   \\   /\r\n   conv2d  bias\r\n     \\     /\r\n      \\   /\r\n    bias_add\r\n        |\r\n      relu\r\n        |\r\n     reshape\r\n```\r\nThe pattern should match this graph since `conv2d` dominates `reshape` along `bias_add+relu`, provided that we accept the original definition of \"dominator\" in TVM. But the change in PR https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/15473 makes the matching fail because it treats `bias` as an addtional path.\r\n\r\nThis is fixed by skipping the leaf arguments when matching the 'path' part of the dominator pattern.\r\n\r\nThe issue may be rooted in some confusion of the definition of \"dominator\" in TVM, as described in [this post](https://discuss.tvm.apache.org/t/question-on-fuzzy-path-matching-matching-arbitrary-number-and-type-of-nodes-in-path/11493/3). But at present, since the original definition of \"dominator\" remains unchanged in the real codebase, I think my patch may still make sense.

commit extends the functionality of the SME dense and matmul schedules to support operations with fp16 inputs and an fp32 output, where `transpose_a=False` and `transpose_b=True`.\r\n\r\nFor

to this commit, the RAII handler in `NDArray` would always attempt to free a cuda memory allocation on destruction.  However, the call to `cudaFree` may throw an exception.  If this happens during stack unwinding due to a previously-thrown exception, this causes the program to immediately terminate, making it difficult to identify the source of the original error.\r\n\r\nThis can commonly occur if an async compute kernel performs an illegal memory access.  An exception is thrown from the next cuda API call following the asynchronous error, causing the stack to unwind.  If the stack contains any `NDArray` instances which reference cuda allocations, the destructor of these `NDArray` instances will attempt to free memory, triggering the segfault.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the `CUDADeviceAPI::FreeDataSpace` function to check if the program is currently unwinding the stack due to a thrown exception, while the cuda driver has been left in an unrecoverable state.  If this occurs, no attempt to free memory is made, as all cuda API calls will result in an error, and the original exception is allowed to propagate.\r\n\r\nIf the cuda driver is in an unrecoverable state, but no exception is currently unwinding the stack, then this may be the first cuda API call to occur after the asynchronous error.  In this case, the `cudaFree` call is still performed, which throws the initial

to this commit, the `SessionObj::Shutdown` method could be called from the C++ API, but could not be called through the Python API.  While it is implicitly called when the `SessionObj` is destructed, Python's garbage collection may result in the destruction occurring later than expected.\r\n\r\nThis commit exposes `SessionObj::Shutdown` through the Python API as `disco.Session.shutdown`, allowing it to be closed

to this commit, while the `num_workers` argument was provided to the `disco.Session` object, it could not be determined from an existing `disco.Session` object.  As a result, functions that interacted with a multi-GPU setup frequently required separate `num_workers` and `disco_session` argument, which could erroneously be out-of-sync (e.g. passing the incorrect `num_workers`, or omitting the `disco_session` argument when `num_workers>1`).\r\n\r\nTo remove this class of errors, this commit adds a `disco.Session.num_workers` property.  The separate `num_workers` argument is no longer necessary, as it can be determined from the `disco.Session` instance.","created_at":"2024-05-08T15:34:01Z","updated_at":"2024-05-14T14:39:03Z","closed_at":"2024-05-14T14:39:00Z","merged_at":"2024-05-14T14:39:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"54c68d6af492e885f5335ca0c5a8336d29277208","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16978/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/16978/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/16978/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/317f06229c0e99473d0aa967fdb02aab93e8b51b","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:disco_num_workers_property","ref":"disco_num_workers_property","sha":"317f06229c0e99473d0aa967fdb02aab93e8b51b","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open
