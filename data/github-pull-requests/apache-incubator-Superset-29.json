change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen the `PRESTO_EXPAND_DATA` feature flag was set to `True`, we've noticed that some of our Presto tables were able to be previewed, while some other failed, with the following traceback\r\n\r\n```\r\n2024-01-30 14:08:00,598:ERROR:flask_appbuilder.api:list index out of range\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File

of range\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe discriminating factor turned out to be the presence of `map` fields in nested rows, causing the `parent_data_type` argument passed to `PrestoEngineSpec._parse_structural_column` classmethod to be mis-parsed, as demonstrated:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n(Pdb) w\r\n...\r\n-> spec._parse_structural_column(\"test_column\", parent_data_type, accumulator)\r\n> /Users/br/wmf/apache/superset/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py(905)_parse_structural_column()\r\n-> stack: list[tuple[str, str]] = []\r\n(Pdb) parent_data_type\r\n'row(\"protocol\" varchar, \"request_headers\" map(varchar, varchar))'\r\n(Pdb) data_types\r\n['test_column row',\r\n '\"protocol\" varchar,\r\n \"request_headers\" map',\r\n 'varchar, varchar))']\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `\"request_headers\" map(varchar, varchar)` token was parsed into `['\"request_headers\" map', 'varchar, varchar))']`, which later on breaks on `['varchar, varchar))'][1]`, as demonstrated in the previous traceback.\r\n\r\nI've decided to fix this bug by removing the key/value types of the map itself from the `parent_data_type` string, as assuming they were parsed correctly, the types do not seem to be used by SQLAlchemy anyway:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n(Pdb) cls.get_column_spec('map')\r\nColumnSpec(sqla_type=Map(), generic_type=<GenericDataType.STRING: 1>, is_dttm=False, python_date_format=None)\r\n(Pdb) cls.get_column_spec('map(varchar, varchar)')\r\nColumnSpec(sqla_type=Map(), generic_type=<GenericDataType.STRING: 1>, is_dttm=False, python_date_format=None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, the `parent_data_type` string `'row(\"protocol\" varchar, \"request_headers\" map(varchar, varchar))'` becomes `'row(\"protocol\" varchar, \"request_headers\" map)', which gets successfully parsed as `['test_column row', '\"protocol\" varchar, \"request_headers\" map)']`.\r\n\r\n**Note**:  We also had the same issue with `array` types as well. A Presto `array(string)` column corresponds to a `sqlalchemy.types.ARRAY` type, so we can drop the `(string)` part of the column type.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| -- | -- |\r\n| ![image](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/480131/23cba810-0f1a-46c2-b0fd-040beaa9d282)| <img width=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-30 at 17 16 50\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/480131/5c9f99fc-7a5c-4174-a947-552a2237ef81\"> |\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nTypeScript enum names and keys should always be PascalCase, which is the commonly accepted best practice (see the official docs: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html). This PR does the following:\r\n- Adds ESLint rules to enforce both PascalCase for the enum names and their respective keys.\r\n- Fix the whole FS codebase, including `superset-ui` packages/plugins. The enum values have been left in tact so as to not cause a breaking change.\r\n\r\nNote, that I've made a few exceptions, where deviating from pascal case makes more sense, especially the locales and currencies, where it felt dangerous and less intuitive to move to pascal case.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Pull the codebase, try to rename a TS enum to snake case, and notice how the linter complains.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nWhen dependabot bumps packages for monorepo packages/plugins, it doesn't work out. It bumps package.json, but it's not smart enough to know that it needs to run `npm install` from the root of the `superset-frontend` folder. This action will keep an eye out for these PRs from dependabot on those paths, and run the installation command, and push the package lock file.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

Fixes <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/867\">#867</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/1012\">#1012</a>. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/hrsh7th\">hrsh7th</a> for implementing it in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/941\">#941</a>!</li>\n<li>[breaking change] Promise based reducers are no longer supported. Conceptually it is an anti pattern to hold on to drafts over time. If needed the old behavior can still be achieved by leveraging <code>createDraft</code> and <code>finishDraft</code>.</li>\n<li>[breaking change] ES5 mode (for legacy browsers) has been dropped. If your project relies on <code>enableES5()</code>, you SHOULD NOT upgrade Immer. <code>enableES5</code> has been removed.</li>\n<li>[breaking change] <code>produce</code> is no longer exposed as the <code>default</code> export. This improves eco system compatibility, and makes sure that there is only one correct way of doing things</li>\n<li>[breaking change] <code>enableAllPlugins</code> has been removed, use <code>enablePatches(); enableMapSet()</code> instead</li>\n<li>[breaking change] shortening the length of a JSON array now results in delete patches, rather than a mutation of the <code>length</code> property, in accordance with JSON spec. Thanks <a href=\"https://github.com/kshramt\">kshramt</a> for implementing this in <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/964\">#964</a>!</li>\n<li>Immer is now an ESM package that can be directly imported into the browser. CJS should still work, UMD support has been removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, there is a rough performance increase of 33% for Immer (and in some cases significantly higher), and the (non gzipped) bundle size has reduced from 16 to 11.5 KB, while the the minimal gzipped import of just <code>produce</code> has remained roughly the same at 3.3 KB.</p>\n<p>For more details, see <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/immerjs/immer/issues/1015\">#1015</a></p>\n<h2>Migration steps</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>If you have any <code>enableES5()</code> call, don't migrate</li>\n<li>When using getters/ setters icmw plain objects, call <code>useStrictShallowCopy(true)</code> at startup</li>\n<li>Replace all default imports: Replace <code>import produce from &quot;immer&quot;</code> with <code>import {produce} from &quot;immer&quot;</code></li>\n<li>Replace all calls to <code>enableAllPlugins()</code> with <code>enablePatches(); enableMapSet();</code> to be more specific and smoothen future migrations.</li>\n</ol>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR does a few things:\r\n\r\n* Splits the github action for docs in half\r\n  * One now only runs on pushes to master... it builds and deploys docs after checking for secrets\r\n  * One now only runs on PRs, and doesn't need secrets. It does typechecking (new step) and builds docs, and should run even on forks (e.g. dependabot bumps)\r\n * Fixes a couple of typescript checks that were noticed by the typechecking script.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nfixes ephemeral envs, broken by: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26473\r\n\r\nI'm taking the ephemeral build out of the docker/`pull_request` workflow trigger and placing it on

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis contribution delivers usability enhancements to the Custom Server Page Length feature in Superset. This upgrade now enables custom input values to persist in the drop-down list. The previous version of this feature posed an inconvenience as any new custom value entered by the user would disappear from the drop-down list when the user moved to a different choice.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation, however, ensures any custom value entered by the user remains in the drop-down list, thereby enriching user accessibility for frequent inputs. Moreover, the system now auto-arranges the drop-down list every time a new value is included, facilitating easy and efficient navigation.\r\n\r\nAdditional modifications include introducing a cap on the maximum custom page length value. The cap will be equivalent to either the total rows of data results or a fixed 10k rows in scenarios where the total rows of data exceed 10,000. \r\n\r\n### BEFORE SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/87610632/d6462d1f-1a74-4505-89f2-bf8f459147c5\r\n\r\n\r\n### AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/87610632/dbb1d509-5886-4452-a559-4bd465bb6e30\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n1. Navigate to the Charts page\r\n2. Choose any dataset\r\n3. Choose table chart\r\n4. Check the Server Pagination checkbox\r\n5. Enter a new value in the selection drop-down list\r\n6. Verify that the new input is sticky in the drop-down list\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an

SUMMARY\r\nWhen using the Time-series table chart, many times users want to compare the current value of a metric with the beginning of the time range. The problem is that the time lag is a fixed number of periods calculated from the last data point, and as time advances, users lose the initial reference, making it impossible to compare a value agains the beginning of the time range. This PR fixes this problem by allowing negative time lag values which will calculate the time period starting from the beginning of the time range, increasing the chart's flexibility. \r\n\r\n###

While working on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26772, I realized that the has-secret logic was broken for unclear reasons. Now after doing this fix, I looked and realized that there's similar logic across about a dozen other gh actions, and thought it'd be a good thing to refactor/fix this with a reusable action.\r\n\r\nNow many of these workflows are set to trigger on push-on-master only meaning it's less of an issue since a false positive on has-secret dpesn't matter in that context since there's always a secret.\r\n\r\nI still thought I should refactor this to something we can trust and build upon.\r\n\r\nThe solution introduces this new simple reusable action.\r\n\r\nOne minor note is in cases where we need multiple secrets, as in say DOCKERHUB_TOKEN and DOCKERHUB_USER, we simply look at one and assume that's clear-enough of an

SUMMARY\r\nThis commit reopens #26156, which resolves the issue detailed in https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26276 by excluding the changes in 'QueryAutoRefresh/index.tsx' and

working on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26772, I realized that the has-secret logic was broken for unclear reasons. Now after doing this fix, I looked and realized that there's similar logic across about a dozen other gh actions, and thought it'd be a good thing to refactor/fix this with a reusable action.\r\n\r\nNow many of these workflows are set to trigger on push-on-master only meaning it's less of an issue since a false positive on has-secret dpesn't matter in that context since there's always a secret.\r\n\r\nI still thought I should refactor this to something we can trust and build upon.\r\n\r\nThe solution introduces this new simple reusable action.\r\n\r\nOne minor note is in

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis patch fixes failures occuring when performing a schema preview of a Presto table.\r\n\r\nThe `PrestoBaseEngineSpec.where_latest_partition` method attempts to construct SQLAlchemy `Column` objects based on a name and a type. However, this leads to the following error, in our case:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nsqlalchemy.exc.ArgumentError: 'SchemaItem' object, such as a 'Column' or a 'Constraint' expected, got 'VARCHAR'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis comes from the fact that we [run](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/master/superset/db_engine_specs/presto.py#L510) `Column('column_name', 'VARCHAR')` instead of `Column('column_name', sqlalchemy.types.VARCHAR)`. We fix this particular error by passing the _actual_ type class (whether `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`, `TIMESTAMP`, etc), and not just a string representation of it.\r\n\r\n> [!NOTE]\r\n> This also fixes the same issue for Trino tables (as described in [this comment](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/26740#issuecomment-1906626757), as `TrinoEngineSpec` inherits\r\n> from `PrestoBaseEngineSpec`, the Presto db client class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n| Before | After |\r\n| -- | -- |\r\n| ![before](https://github.com/apache/superset/assets/480131/99d91b6e-cbdc-4498-9959-e66b46f0b384) | <video src=\"https://github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com/480131/299348658-68eb9530-6fbc-489b-aef3-6b139ddbc463.mov?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAVCODYLSA53PQK4ZA%2F20240124%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20240124T143612Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=c0d9b167cbe1cc843285f298c851696f2ddd109b9e01753231980544ed2e39fa&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&actor_id=480131&key_id=0&repo_id=39464018\"> |\r\n\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

the docker builds after merging a PR where I was getting a false positive since it was directly location on the main fork. Now when rebasing and executing docker from forks we get errors messages.\r\n\r\nThe root cause was this: https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26766/files#diff-bcd99032795eb96dd42d38ceeeec262f6d4ab3952e3dbfb75905763c116cd0d7R133-R134\r\n\r\nWhere I used the `apache/superset-cache` DockerHub instead of the main one, as it was recommended for optimization purposes. In this PR, I'll point it back to `apache/superset` after confirming the issue, so I can confirm the fix.\r\n\r\nError looked like this on cache-push:\r\n```\r\n#17 exporting cache to registry\r\n#17 preparing build cache for export\r\n#17 writing layer sha256:6574fa54520867ff3b1634aa74c4749441c37892c2ee032cf292b798e4ee6770\r\n#17 preparing build cache for export 0.1s done\r\n#17 writing layer sha256:6574fa54520867ff3b1634aa74c4749441c37892c2ee032cf292b798e4ee6770 0.1s done\r\n#17 ERROR: error writing layer blob: failed to authorize: failed to fetch oauth token: unexpected status from GET request to https://auth.docker.io/token?scope=repository%3Aapache%2Fsuperset-cache%3Apull%2Cpush&service=registry.docker.io: 401 Unauthorized\r\n\r\n#18 [auth] apache/superset-cache:pull,push token for registry-1.docker.io\r\n#18 DONE 0.0s\r\n------\r\n > exporting cache to registry:\r\n------\r\nERROR: failed to solve: error writing layer blob: failed to authorize: failed to fetch oauth token: unexpected status from GET request to https://auth.docker.io/token?scope=repository%3Aapache%2Fsuperset-cache%3Apull%2Cpush&service=registry.docker.io: 401 Unauthorized\r\nError: Process completed with exit code 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is confusing as we're able to push images and layers, but not use the hub as cache. Probably some permission setting of some kind. Though I think the security is a bit reversed, meaning people shouldn't be able to publish an actual image, say to `apache/superset:latest` from a fork, but the \"using the repo as a cache\" is less of an issue as no one would pull from random cache.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nAfter looking at an old PR where someone was updating the generated .json files, I thought I'd refresh myself on the actual translation

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nThis is the first PR in a series to improve our SQL parsing, in effort to clean up the code base and make it more secure.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have a class called `superset.sql_parse.ParsedQuery` that is used as an interface every time we need to parse or manipulate SQL. There are a few problems with the status quo:\r\n\r\n1. Even though the class is called `ParsedQuery`, it's designed to accept a single SQL **statement**, not necessarily a query. For example, it has a `set_or_update_query_limit` method that works only on the first statement, if there are multiple.\r\n2. Even though it's designed to accept a single statement, it doesn't raise an error when instantiated with a query that has multiple statements, so in several places the class is used with a full query.\r\n3. There are multiple places that import `sqlparse` directly to manipulate SQL. For example, when inserting RLS into a query, or when modifying a query to insert a `LIMIT` or `TOP`.\r\n4. In many places we manipulate SQL inefficiently, serializing and deserializing the SQL multiple times.\r\n\r\nIdeally we'd have a single abstraction that handles SQL parsing. Superset code should never parse code directly by importing a 3rd party library like `sqlparse`, `sqloxide`, or `sqlglot`; instead, it should only call the abstraction. Similarly, the abstraction should wrap library specific exceptions (like `sqlglot.errors.ParseError`) with its own.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new classes that aim to be those abstractions: `SQLScript` and `SQLStatement`. The `SQLStatement` strictly represents a single SQL statement. These classes are instantiated with SQL and an optional engine (a `BaseEngineSpec.engine` attribute), and should provide all the methods needed for manipulating and introspecting SQL queries and statements. The initial implementation uses `sqlglot`, but the clean interface allows the parser to be changed in the future if we want.\r\n\r\nMy plan for improving the SQL parsing is first to get rid of code outside of `sql_parse.py` that using `sqlparse` directly:\r\n\r\n- [x] Introduce `SQLScript` and `SQLStatement`, and replace any simple calls to `sqlparse` with calls to the new classes (this PR).\r\n- [ ] Implement a custom `SQLStatement` class for `Kusto`, since [it doesn't use conventional SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).\r\n- [ ] Implement `insert_rls_in_predicate` inside `SQLStatement`.\r\n- [ ] Implement `get_cte_query` inside `SQLStatement`.\r\n- [ ] Implement `apply_top_to_sql` in `SQLStatement`.\r\n\r\nAt this point we should have `sqlparse` being used only inside `sql_parse.py` by `ParsedQuery`. The last steps would be:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Replace all calls to `ParsedQuery` with calls to the new classes.\r\n- [ ] Get rid of the `sqlparse` dependency.\r\n\r\nNote that despite the big changes, no public interfaces will change. Also, we've been gradually changing the parser due to security issues, having introduced `sqlglot` as a dependency in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/26476. Because of this, I thought it wouldn't be necessary to write a SIP. I'm happy to write one if people think it's necessary.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nI noticed recently that we get many \"double-triggers\" of CI actions on some PRs, most notable on PRs opened from the main apache repo, triggering against the master branch (see screenshot bellow). This is typically one for the `push` action and one for the `pull_request` action, running effectively the exact same CI script twice. Note that I think the double triggers also on forks (I'd have to double check), but just doesn't show under the PR list of required CI steps, and is probably just associated with the fork of the user.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, so I went through all the githbub workflows and applied more restrictions. In most cases we apply the main pattern:\r\n```yaml\r\non:\r\n  push:\r\n    branches:\r\n      - 'master'\r\n  pull_request:\r\n    types: [synchronize, opened, reopened, ready_for_review]\r\n```\r\nThis will trigger for each change on the pull request, and for every commit as it merges on the `master` branch.\r\n\r\nIn some other cases, I added a `paths` statement

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nCurrently, exporting models functionality is slower than it can be.\r\n\r\n\r\nModel export is slow because models export their related models, and since related models cannot check if they have already been exported to the final archive, they are exported anyway. This leads to generating unnecessary export model files.\r\nFor example, exporting a dashboard with 2 charts will generate 4 files - a dashboard, two charts, a dataset, and a database, but ““behind the scenes” there will actually be 7 files generated, since each chart will re-export the dataset and database, and at the end, the highest-level export model (dashboard export) will remove these duplicates.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, it is proposed to start generating export files not immediately, but only when they are written to a file, by convert `file_content` to function that generates content when we call it.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\npay attention to speed up of generating an dashboard export archive!\r\n\r\n## Before\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/66589759/76551088-5d87-4c4d-b89d-fcc4c66f1b27\r\n\r\n\r\n## After \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/assets/66589759/4489b671-6c17-4f9a-a955-e5b285f5e5c4\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe feature change involves retaining search filter results across SQL Lab tabs by integrating search text into the Redux state.\r\n\r\nUnder the previous system, users would encounter the resetting of their search results each time they switched to a different SQL Lab tab and back. This process required users to repeatedly enter their search filters, resulting in a disrupted workflow.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement directly tackles this inconvenience. Upon rendering SQL Lab, it now utilizes the search text stored in Redux state as the filter value. This ensures that no matter how many tabs a user switches between, the search filter results remain persistent, no longer disappearing upon tab switching.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

on the resulting output table using the search box\r\n- Navigate to other  SQL editor tab\r\n- Return to the initial SQL editor tab\r\n- Notice that the previously input search text and filter results are still visible\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has

introduces a vital usability upgrade to the SQL Editor within Apache Superset. The enhancement consists of a coding modification that embeds the cursor position into the Redux state.\r\n\r\nTraditionally, every time users switch between SQL Lab tabs, the SQL editor viewport resets, forcing them to scroll from the top to locate their last worked-on position. This scenario presents an inconvenience that disrupts workflow and decreases editing efficiency.\r\n\r\nThis update directly addresses the issue. Upon rendering the SQL editor, it now auto-focuses on the saved cursor position from the Redux state, aligning the screen with the user's last point of work. Users can now effortlessly switch tabs, and upon their return, find the SQL Editor positioned exactly where they left off.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

Switch to other SQL editor tab\r\n- Switch back to the original SQL editor tab\r\n- Verify that cursor focus on exact location where it was placed before you switched tabs\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL
