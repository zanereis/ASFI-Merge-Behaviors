patch fixes thread safety with `ICUTokenizer` and makes it pass the `TestRandomStrings` and `TestRandomHugeStrings` of both `TestICUTokenizer` and `TestICUTokenizerCJK` test classes (see #269). This serves as proof that thread safety is broken in ICU4N's BreakIterator and the patch can be reverted once the thread safety issues have been addressed in ICU4N.\r\n\r\nThe `ThaiTokenizer` is also patched slightly better here, but it still occasionally fails the `TestRandomStrings` and `TestRandomHugeStrings` tests (see #269).\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains some performance improvements for `AttributeSource` that make the tests less likely to run slow due to threading contention issues or unnecessary dictionary

fixes #326 \r\n\r\n`Debugging.Assert()` overloads were created to replace `Debug.Assert()` so they don't get compiled out of production builds. In addition, the `message` parameter is a `Func<string>` so we don't have the performance impact (or errors) caused by building messages for succeeding asserts.\r\n\r\nThe task was expanded to include a workflow for turning off asserts when running tests. This is primarily to verify that the release build will function with asserts disabled, but can also be used to improve CI performance by reducing the amount of testing that

fixes a bottleneck (see #261) caused by unzipping the line docs file in RAM (~15MB) and then selecting a random line in the file. The .NET `GZipStream` is not seekable, so this was done by copying the entire contents into a `MemoryStream` first. This happened during a significant number of the tests (~20%), and happened in each one of those tests.\r\n\r\nThe fix was to set up the test framework to unzip the file to a temp file on the test machine. This happens in 1 of 3 different ways:\r\n\r\n1. If `LineFileDocs` is used directly in a class that does not specify `LuceneTestCase.UseTempLineDocsFile = true`, `LineFileDocs` will unzip the file before it is used (per instance of the class) and deleted when it is disposed.\r\n2. If `LuceneTestCase.UseTempLineDocsFile = true` is specified in the test fixture, the file will be unzipped in the `BeforeClass()` method and deleted in the `AfterClass()` method.\r\n3. If the test project makes heavy use of this file, adding a subclass of `LuceneTestFrameworkInitializer` to the test project (outside of all namespaces) will cause the file to be unzipped only once for all of the tests in that project and deleted after the last test is finished.\r\n\r\nThere are also several other patches in this PR:\r\n\r\n- The seek behavior of `LineFileDocs` was reverted back to Lucene's original implementation, which has revealed some (potential) false positives in some of the ICU tests. A `BufferedStream` was added to improve performance.\r\n- Removed unnecessary variable allocations.\r\n- Fixed a bug with the `Nightly`, `Weekly`, `Slow`, and `AwaitsFix` attributes so they will wait until NUnit runs the initialization code before running.\r\n- Added a `DeadlockAttribute` to time out tests that we are now seeing threading contention issues with after improving raw speed. This is to ensure that they will fail in the CI environment if they actually deadlock and also can be used to filter out these tests during runs.\r\n- Simplified some expressions to make them simpler to maintain.\r\n- Commented out dead code and unnecessary variable declarations that were carried over from Java.\r\n- Fixed a bug in the `ICUTokenizer` where it was calling `System.Char.IsWhiteSpace()` when it should have been calling `ICU4N.UChar.IsWhiteSpace()` to ensure it is reading the correct version of ICU.\r\n- Changed implementation of `DisposableThreadLocal` to that of RavenDB, [with permission from its maintainers](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENENET-640?focusedCommentId=17033146&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17033146).

fixes several Analysis.Common classes that were broken since 4.8.0-beta00008 in commit https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/commit/b733c4d158e5e1de62c6b12797c589ac70b4c1c7 because the `Character` class was changed to J2N which uses the current culture by default instead of Java's default of invariant culture for uppercasing and lowercasing. As a result, these classes were unintentionally modified in behavior. This patch reverts them back to the invariant culture (or specific culture for the class, where applicable).\r\n\r\nAlso, a bug was discovered where a cast from `int` to `char` caused many analysis classes to incorrectly process surrogate pairs, which this addresses.\r\n\r\nWe were also able to revert the `TurkishLowercaseFilter` back to its original implementation by utilizing `J2N.Character` to do the heavy lifting instead of

PR has several changes. Here are the highlights:\r\n\r\n1. Swapped in a faster `ICollection<T>.ToArray()` extension method that takes precedence over `IEnumerable<T>.ToArray()` from LINQ.\r\n2. Fixed `FSTTester` to delete while iterating forward over the list using `ConcurrentDictionary`  instead of using `ElementAt()` to iterate in reverse, which sped up the FST tests by 2/3.\r\n3. `Lucene.Net.Facet.Taxonomy.WriterCache.NameInt32CacheLRU`: Changed `Dictionary` to `ConcurrentDictionary` so items can be removed from the cache while iterating forward through it.\r\n4. Upgraded J2N to 2.0.0-beta-0009, ICU4N to 60.1.0-alpha.352 and Morfologik.Stemming to 2.1.6-beta-0007.\r\n5. Disabled build warnings that require .NET Standard 2.1, since we target more platforms\r\n6.

addresses the following:\r\n\r\n- Reverted testing conditions from 2200e79938ac6de7d002fe3ab8944d3c3cdeb211. The maximum random string length set at 20 instead of 10 was slowing down tests.\r\n- Refactored `Assert` class to use custom comparisons on all overloads. NUnit is way too slow, so we need our own conditions.\r\n- Imported our `Assert` class in some tests where it was being bypassed.\r\n- Replaced `LinkedList<T>` with `Queue<T>` in places where a queue provides a performance advantage.\r\n- Refactored `DirectoryTaxonomyReader<T>` to reduce locking and eliminated unnecessary type conversions.\r\n- Updated C# language version to 8.0\r\n- Added support for filtering public field scanning with a regex in `TestApiConsistency`\r\n- Consolidated empty array creation code so it is

addresses a fix for random failures in the TestRandomstrings and TestRandomHugeStrings. It seems that in the tight loop using the same Random variable creates some issues \"randomly\". This was not repeatable using a seed so my guess is it is due to the threads or some other concurrency within the subfunctions.\r\n\r\nI did a lot of work to prove that the outputs from RandomAnalysisString where consistent. The issue was CheckAnalysisConsistency and I didnt see an obvious or even obscure reason why it would fail.\r\n\r\nI havent run into any test fails so far but that doesnt mean there isnt one in the next run.

is a WIP to fix #308 \r\n\r\nThe first part is that this fixes a deadlock issues with MockDirectoryWrapper. \r\n\r\n* This was locking on `this` which seems common from the java port. This wasn't the problem but lock (this) shouldn't be used since there is no way of knowing if something else is locking on that object which will cause deadlocks. This has been changed to lock on a private field. I have verified that there is no other code that ever locks on a directory object so there was nothing important about locking on `this`.\r\n* Deadlocks are easily produced when there are recursive locks which happened often in MockDirectoryWrapper. Take for example the call to MockDirectoryWrapper.CreateOutput which takes a lock, then it calls into MaybeThrowDeterministicException which takes the same lock and then it calls into MaybeThrowIOExceptionOnOpen which also takes the same lock, then Init with the same lock and then within the same method is taking a recursive lock on the same lock, then in AddFileHandle again the same lock. This all occurs within the same method CreateOutput. Meanwhile, if any other thread calls any other method that uses this lock (which seems like all of them) you'll get a deadlock\r\n* This can be fixed by ensuring there's never recursive locks taken. Currently this means there are private methods suffixed with the term \"Locked\" which double check they are being called within a lock. The original methods that explicitly create the lock now call into their sister \"Locked\" methods.\r\n\r\nThere's currently a temp test in this code which allows to run the slow running test over and over until it runs for longer than the specified time. With the deadlock fixed I think i can now see where the slowness of the method comes from so will now look into profiling this.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-21T03:11:05Z","updated_at":"2021-03-19T19:24:51Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/312/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/312/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/312/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/8fd1c78b7445ca2d672f14febdc68c4aeacaebff","head":{"label":"apache:bugfix/308-TestAddIndexesWithCloseNoWait","ref":"bugfix/308-TestAddIndexesWithCloseNoWait","sha":"8fd1c78b7445ca2d672f14febdc68c4aeacaebff","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

is a WIP for creating benchmarkdotnet tests to see performance (currently for testing between nuget packages).\r\n\r\nI have asked about specifying different nuget package sources here https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/pull/922#issuecomment-658519567 (I feel like I had done this in some way when implementing that feature but can't remember now) since that will be needed to test the 'current' version. It is not possible to reference the 'current' projects and then also use 'WithNuget' because that results in Nuget errors.\r\n\r\nCurrently just added a single benchmark as an example, this is just the script from the home page. There's manual iterations specified in there so that we don't get warnings from BenchmarkDotNet about `MultimodalDistribution` or `MinIterationTime` since one less iterations are too fast to measure correctly. \r\n\r\nThis example benchmark isn't showing much since the results are nearly identical between versions, for example: \r\n\r\n``` ini\r\n\r\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.12.1, OS=Windows

PR contains several updates, here are the highlights:\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n- Removed ~75% of LINQ code that was slowing down performance\r\n- Optimized empty array creation\r\n- Optimized empty collection creation\r\n- Replaced `BitArray` with `BitSet`, as the extension methods that were used to \"patch\" `BitArray` are slow\r\n- Optimized ~75% of regular expression calls by replacing static methods with pre-compiled statically-cached Regex instances\r\n\r\nA few of these updates are very impactful affecting both the default codec and code that is common among most analyzers.\r\n\r\n## Housekeeping\r\n\r\n- Straightened up license headers\r\n- Changed entire solution to use expression style property syntax, when possible\r\n- Cleaned up leading whitespace to use spaces instead of tabs\r\n- Renamed private/internal fields camel case in all of the core tests\r\n- Removed most unnecessary fully-qualified exception names\r\n- Removed legacy .NET Core 1.x and .NET Standard 1.x support from project files and cleaned up dependencies","created_at":"2020-07-11T19:58:04Z","updated_at":"2020-07-11T20:00:22Z","closed_at":"2020-07-11T20:00:22Z","merged_at":"2020-07-11T20:00:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"081edeed35b190c1d535dcfdfeb91143f0ef818f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/309/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/309/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/309/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/3d540643962302f2956265b50003ae39b72d01e4","head":{"label":"NightOwl888:fix/4.8.0-performance-2","ref":"fix/4.8.0-performance-2","sha":"3d540643962302f2956265b50003ae39b72d01e4","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63890962,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzg5MDk2Mg==","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"NightOwl888/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet","description":"Mirror

are quite a lot of changes here. Just creating a PR for completeness with notes.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with docs before was that due to the nature of how the Lucene project is structured (this comes from Java), there are quite a few overlapping namespaces between projects and the way docfx works is that each namespace, class, etc... gets assigned its own ID (UID) which is based on how Roslyn queries those types so it's not very flexible to try to change the UID results. Previously we had a single docfx api docs site that would build the metadata for all projects and then build a single site. This seemed to work however you would quickly notice that the links weren't working which is due to overlapping/colliding UIDs (xrefs). The new docs format means we create a docfx 'site' per Lucene package (i.e. Core, Common Analysis, Facets, etc... ). This is actually the way that the Lucene api docs are structured too and how Microsoft's own docs are structured (more or less). \r\n\r\nNow each package site is build separately from each other which means no colliding UIDs and links work correctly. We then build the containing site and pass in all exported xref docs from each package so that the wrapping site can auto-link through to the package sites. This is still a little buggy because there is of course still colliding xrefs but we can fix this up more easily. See https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/issues/300\r\n\r\n* docs.ps1 has been updated with better script parameters allowing more granular control over the build\r\n* separating each package into it's own docfx files\r\n* separating the templates out so that we are not duplicating the need for assets in each package site\r\n* adds separate toc files for each package site to provide more granular control\r\n* uses JS extensions in templates to ensure that the Git source repo linked to when using the \"View Source\" button is always the main lucenenet git repo, else it can show up as your own local repository because this is controlled purely by git commands (not configurable in docfx)\r\n* Merged the new Codec docs into this one\r\n* Re-ran the docs conversion tool\r\n* Changed the documentation csproj to use PackageReference and adds support for a new environment variable extension\r\n* Adds convert.ps1 to assist with automating the docs conversion process\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-06-30T23:59:36Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T00:03:32Z","closed_at":"2020-07-01T00:03:28Z","merged_at":"2020-07-01T00:03:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"3d30140ddb95479f856cc705c8ce9436d996d23c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/304/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/304/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/304/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/07e1d137ddbe2f76b88c8de7eb1a3f2be7d971ef","head":{"label":"apache:docs-poc","ref":"docs-poc","sha":"07e1d137ddbe2f76b88c8de7eb1a3f2be7d971ef","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

fixes #267 by converting these asserts that were intended for control flow during testing into `InvalidOperationException`s. In the test framework, we are still throwing `Lucene.Net.Diagnostics.AssertionException` in order to differentiate an \"assert\" from other cases that are throwing `InvalidOperationException`.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to how Lucene 8.x behaves, and only affects legacy codecs for `Lucene3x` and `Lucene40`.\r\n\r\nAs for `BlockTreeTermsWriter`, its assert was failing due to lack of validation on the `Prefix` to ensure it is valid UTF-8. Since the problem is only when building the string in the assert, a private method was added to generate the string by catching exceptions due to invalid UTF-8 and falling back to just writing out the display of bytes in

fixes performance of several tests by eliminating boxing/unboxing when passing arguments to test asserts. We already had our own facade `Assert` class, but needed to extend it with overloads for primitive types.\r\n\r\nIn addition, one of the contributors of the slowness of `OfflineSorter` has been addressed, as well as the primary contributor to the slowness of the `Lucene.Net.Facet.Taxonomy.WriterCache.TestCharBlockArray.TestArray` test.\r\n\r\nBased on several runs on Azure DevOps, this reduces the average testing time by approximately 10 minutes (45min average instead of 55min).

Shad,\r\n\r\nI have completed a couple of the tasks that you set: \r\n\r\n1. Replace all private/internal nested IComparer<T> implementations (usually including the word \"Anonymous\" in the name) with the Comparer.Create() method (see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/28533921). This will eliminate a lot of unnecessary classes and make the code correspond to Java better, which uses anonymous classes to achieve similar code inlining. If you are unsure if one needs to be converted to inline code rather than a concrete class, check the Java implementation to see if it is inline (https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/tree/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.0/lucen\r\ne).\r\n\r\n2. Change overloads of OpenStringBuilder.Append(charsequence, start, end) to OpenStringBuilder.Append(charsequence, startIndex, charCount) to match the conventions in .NET\r\n(https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/1274197c39b4b229af7c6734d35840ff21\r\nd47e97/src/Lucene.Net.Analysis.Common/Analysis/Util/OpenStringBuilder.cs#L98\r\n). In Java, the convention is to use start index and end index to select text in a string, but in .NET, the corresponding convention is to use start index and length (count).\r\n\r\nOn building in Azure I noticed that the set BuildNumber step in the Build.ps1 file was failing. This is due to some changes to the Azure pipeline. These variables are now readonly. I commented this line to successfully run the build/test process but you may want to look at it in more detail.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nMichael\r\n","created_at":"2020-03-31T10:03:08Z","updated_at":"2020-04-01T15:26:32Z","closed_at":"2020-04-01T15:26:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9fdc3400527436a72b61fada6f5890ed2ae59ffd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/58be5bae2776dd9922d4255e5e4244aca8a7bc3f","head":{"label":"bongohrtech:master","ref":"master","sha":"58be5bae2776dd9922d4255e5e4244aca8a7bc3f","user":{"login":"bongohrtech","id":27625802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3NjI1ODAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/27625802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech","html_url":"https://github.com/bongohrtech","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bongohrtech/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1274197c39b4b229af7c6734d35840ff21d47e97","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

GitHub to see the actual code for this file (inception!)\r\n  * TODO: the facet demos all work but not the Lucene.Net.Demo yet, will do this week\r\n* Updatse to latest docfx and latest docfx nuget components\r\n* Fixes `documenation` spelling mistake\r\n* Fixes converted markdown for bold and italics since the previous format doesn't work with bullet points\r\n* Adds the website build to the azure pipelines build, BTW both the docs and the website successfully build now, you can see my custom setup https://shazwazza.visualstudio.com/Lucene.Net%20Build%20Test/_build?definitionId=1&_a=summary\r\n* Re-runs the docs migrator - which is why there's so many changes, these are due to the automation

Fixes build of csproj doc tools to not include the strong name signing\r\n* Fixes some namespaces issues in the JavaDocToMarkdownConverter\r\n* Re-executes the JavaDocToMarkdownConverter and commits updated files (incuding whitespaces so on next run there's no changes)\r\n* Fixes UI auto-expanding quirk with docfx and the docs (hamburger menu)\r\n* Fixes some links from the docs home page and removes the ICU `to be completed` note\r\n\r\nI have upload the result of this to our temporary docs site https://lucenenetdocs.azurewebsites.net/\r\n\r\n@NightOwl888 just regarding your comments here https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206#issuecomment-519378752\r\n\r\n### home page/package names\r\n\r\nCan you elaborate a bit more on this:\r\n\r\n> It would probably be easier to understand if we updated the names on the home page to reflect the package names\r\n\r\n... I've moved the Kuromoji and SmartCn headings outside of the big Analysis heading since they are separate packages and linked to them properly from the home page, is this the type of thing you mean? I also fixed the ICU link on the home page. \r\n\r\n(there's currently still an issue with docfx when there is overlapping namespaces between packages, i haven't yet researched into how to fix this but i can, the docfx team are very responsive)\r\n\r\n### build/build times\r\n\r\nA full clean build takes about 20 mins on my machine so should be ok for the build server. On the build server you'd want to run the powershell:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./websites/apidocs/docs.ps1 0 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is shorthand for\r\n\r\n```\r\n./websites/apidocs/docs.ps1 --ServeDocs 0 --Clean 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output website is in `./websites/apidocs/_site`\r\n\r\n### versioning\r\n\r\nI know that in the JavaDocToMarkdownConverter there's a TODO for passing in a tab/version which is for the method `RepoLinkReplacer` ... but, this method is looking for links in files like `overview.md` with this syntax `src-html`, but as far as i can see there is only 2x places in all of the source that contains these types of links which is in the `Lucene.Net/overview.md` file which is supposed to link to some demos. For this method it would prob just be easier to fix this file, unless there are more inline links i'm unsure of.\r\n\r\nApart from that is there another area where we need to have the version number/tag injected in places?\r\n\r\n_update: just noticed a version link here https://lucenenetdocs.azurewebsites.net/index.html#reference-documents ... so we'd need to pass a version into the build for that one, do you know of others?_\r\n\r\n### hosting\r\n\r\nThe docs are currently just hosted on my azure subscription which is also why it has that temporary dns name. I'm fine to leave it there for any length of time but we should look at getting these hosted properly, it's just static files so nothing special.

fixes the TestThreadInterruptDeadlock  and TestTwoThreadsInterruptDeadlock.\r\n\r\nI've added a ThreadClass::interrupted() to match Java's Thread.interrupted(). Most of the issues seems related to the interrupt flag not being cleared, which will cause a ThreadInterruptedException next time the thread blocks.\r\n\r\nChanging MaybeYield to actually yield seems to be needed to avoid some ThreadInterruptedException. It makes sense in my head, since a yield isn't a block and thus an exception isn't thrown, but I have no documentation or evidence that this argument actually holds true. Anyhow, changing to yield matches the Java behavior, so I think this is the correct behavior.","created_at":"2019-01-17T20:49:13Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T17:14:41Z","closed_at":"2019-08-21T18:04:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a0bfa3093184f037ecf358532696245627f45185","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/218/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/218/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/218/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/acb33afea4de8b1b21359350658bff0665c11133","head":{"label":"sisve:fix-testindexwriter","ref":"fix-testindexwriter","sha":"acb33afea4de8b1b21359350658bff0665c11133","user":{"login":"sisve","id":748375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODM3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/748375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve","html_url":"https://github.com/sisve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29899452,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTg5OTQ1Mg==","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"sisve/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sisve","id":748375,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0ODM3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/748375?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve","html_url":"https://github.com/sisve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sisve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sisve/lucenenet","description":"Mirror

Commit is for Review with comments about original Java Source for assistance.\r\n- [x] RevisionFile.Size - Please change to `Length` to .NETify\r\n- [x] IReplicator & IRevision: Please leave the \"I\" prefix in the actual name of the interfaces, but change the names of the files back to the original \"Replicator\" and \"Revision\". It is easier to maintain if the files are in the same order as they are in Java.\r\n- [x] Please change IReadOnlyCollection, IReadOnlyDictionary, etc to ICollection, IDictionary, etc.\r\n- [x] Please rename (the class only, not the file) IndexInputInputStream to IndexInputStream (since in .NET InputStream is just a Stream).\r\n- [x] ~~Please add the project.json and PROJECTNAME.project.json files to the projects (we use these for NuGet dependencies as well as for specifying NuGet package info). See the other projects for examples.~~ **See note**\r\n- [x] Please arrange the code so it is in a similar order as it was in Java. In cases where you need to order it differently (such as de-nesting types), add a \"LUCENENET specific\" comment to indicate it diverges from Java.\r\n- [x] ~~Please ensure it will compile and tests will pass on .NET Core (we use the Lucene.Net.Portable.sln file to do these tests).~~ **See note**\r\n- [x] Replace BinaryFormatter with Json\r\n- [x] Use DataInputStream and DataOutputStream instead of DataInput and DataOutput.\r\n\r\n**Note: Async -> Sync**: There is quite some Async to Sync bridging, ideally I would wan't to provide an Async interface around underlying Async operations, but it has to be done carefully and is therefore somewhat time consuming (I tried but if broke everything)... It wouldn't break compatibility though so it should be something that can be added in a later version.  \r\n\r\n**Note:** Missing .NET Core project files because of the current situation with .NET Core/Standard project files as discussed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENENET-565 \r\n\r\nAdditional tasks before merge:\r\n - [x] Remove all //Java:  comments, they are there for review purposes only.\r\n - [x] Move EnumrableExtensions to Lucene.Support? or Lucene.Util?\r\n - [x] Rethink HttpClientBase and HttpReplicator\r\n - [x] Rethink ReplicatorService, abstractions and AspNetCore implementation.\r\n - [x] Document with Examples of integration with all parts

this as a pull request so the team can discuss this approach vs the previous `ExecuteSearch` method (that was inadvertently removed from the API).\r\n\r\n## AcquireContext Example\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar searcherManager = new SearcherManager(indexWriter, true, null);\r\nusing (var context = searcherManager.AcquireContext())\r\n{\r\n\tIndexSearcher searcher = context.Reference;\r\n\tvar topDocs = searcher.Search(query, 10);\r\n\r\n       // use results...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n1. Eliminates the try-finally block.\r\n2. Doesn't swallow exceptions by default.\r\n3. Implicitly cleans up.\r\n4. Since the extension method is on `ReferenceManager<G>`, all of its subclasses automatically gain this functionality.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n1. If the user forgets the using block, cleanup is not automatic.\r\n\r\n## ExecuteSearch Example\r\n```c#\r\nvar searcherManager = new SearcherManager(indexWriter, true, null);\r\nsearcherManager.ExecuteSearch(searcher =>\r\n{\r\n\tvar topDocs = searcher.Search(query, 10);\r\n\r\n       // use results...\r\n}, exception => { Console.WriteLine(exception.ToString()); });\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n1. Eliminates the try-finally block.\r\n2. Implicitly cleans up.\r\n3. `ExecuteSearch` name makes it easier to find on the API.\r\n4. The user doesn't need to remember any special syntax to clean up.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n1. Swallows exceptions by default. To make the exception bubble, you have to re-throw it.\r\n2. API only applies to SearcherManager, so similar code needs to be repeated for other `ReferenceManager<G>` subclasses.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\nAlthough the `ExecuteSearch` method is well named and thus easier to find on the API, it has the disadvantage of swallowing exceptions by default. Exceptions do not automatically bubble - you have to re-throw the exception (in which case performance suffers and you lose the stack trace). Its main advantage is that there is no way for the user to accidentally forget to clean up.\r\n\r\nThe pattern seems to lend itself better to a using block. If all code examples are shown with a using block the user is not likely to forget it. However, admittedly, `AcquireContext` and `context.Reference` are probably not the most intuitive names (I was torn between `Context` or `Holder` for the name, but there might be a better choice than either of those). `context.Reference` was chosen because `ReferenceContext` is the name of the generic class that holds the reference and it applies to all subclasses of `ReferenceManager<G>`. Of course, the original API was named `Acquire()`, so it seems logical to use `AcquireContext()` or `AcquireHolder()` or something along those lines. Ideas welcome.","created_at":"2017-05-16T17:12:34Z","updated_at":"2017-07-13T18:38:36Z","closed_at":"2017-07-13T18:38:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"47eeb25ca6bced19c9c85dbfd0e18e499d08c32a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/207/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/207/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/207/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/dc9bbc056f678ee2cdd63b0a877c1ff75c37f14a","head":{"label":"NightOwl888:api-reference-context","ref":"api-reference-context","sha":"dc9bbc056f678ee2cdd63b0a877c1ff75c37f14a","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63890962,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzg5MDk2Mg==","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"NightOwl888/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet","description":"Mirror

is a PR to build both a new website and the API documentation using DocFx. \r\n\r\nThere are several changes:\r\n\r\n* build script for both the docs and the website\r\n* updates to the JavaDocToMarkdownConverter (which is the processor to convert the lucene Java docs to a usable md version for docfx ... this is an ongoing update to deal with all of the quirks)\r\n   * Whenever this is run, it will fix/update many of the md converted doc files\r\n* website files for docfx\r\n\r\nTo test the website you can run: `websites/site/site.ps1` which will build the site and start a webserver at http://localhost:8080, any changes made to the site just stop the script (ctrl + c) and re-run it and it will do an incremental build. To just build the website for deployment, run `websites/site/site.ps1 -ServeDocs 1 -Clean 1` which will clean all temp files and compile the website to a static website at `websites/site/_site`. \r\n\r\nTo test the docs you can run: `websites/apidocs/docs.ps1` which will build the site and start a webserver at http://localhost:8080, any changes made to the docs just stop the script (ctrl + c) and re-run it and it will do an incremental build. To just build the docs for deployment, run `websites/apidocs/docs.ps1 -ServeDocs 1 -Clean 1` which will clean all temp files and compile the website to a static website at `websites/apidocs/_site`. \r\n\r\n_(In both cases, the build operation takes a few minutes!)_\r\n\r\n* The new website is already live at https://lucenenet.apache.org/\r\n* A demo of the new docs site is here until we get this hosted properly: https://lucenenetdocs.azurewebsites.net/\r\n\r\nWebsite tasks to complete:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Ensure branding policies are adhered to http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/pmcs\r\n- [ ] Add Build server info to the Contributing section, see https://teamcity.jetbrains.com/project.html?projectId=LuceneNet_PortableBuilds&tab=projectOverview \r\n- [ ] Migrate any of the very important info from the wiki to the getting started section (don't need all of it, but there's probably some critical info there that should be front and center) https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/LUCENENET/Lucene.Net\r\n- [x] Copy/condense the important info from the GitHub readme to the Contributing section https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/README.md\r\n- [ ] Copy/condense the contributing info from the GitHub readme to the Contributing section https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\r\n- [x] Probably add a small section on version 3.0.3 and 2.9.4 with links\r\n- [ ] Add remaining effort on project to website to be *very* clear and obvious, some info is here: https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#porting-work---up-for-grabs and other info is here https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/daefe8f9511827212f00ff49d338a72ef1151c7a0aa6f2a7a1aac0de@%3Cdev.lucenenet.apache.org%3E, but there's also the ICU project that apparently needs work too\r\n- [ ] (Determine if this is absolutely required!) Update download page and include the CGI/mirror/signed zip thing, see 3rd section of this comment https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206#issuecomment-393800264 , source for that is here http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene.net/site/trunk/\r\n- [x] Figure out how to host the site, there is some info here https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/c54762baefb79b56c7bd5899ac198028c6435829a5918e302eda46a7@%3Cdev.lucenenet.apache.org%3E (it's currently using Apache CMS). Since the output of this is a static html/js site it should work (but need to sort out the CGI download page within this build), there are 3 hosting options for apache sites: http://www.apache.org/dev/project-site.html ... seems like `gitpubsub` is the easiest and most flexible to use.\r\n\r\nDocs tasks to complete:\r\n\r\n- [x] Style custom token replacement such as @lucene.experimental and @lucene.internal\r\n- [x] Customized Table of Contents so the nav bar isn't one giant list (we can do this with post build)\r\n- [ ] Ensure view port widths are optimized (might already be fixed with latest doc fx)\r\n- [ ] Fix all invalid cref issues listed in build\r\n- [ ] Part of the build process should be to fetch the 4.8 java source from https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/releases/tag/releases%2Flucene-solr%2F4.8.0 to run the JavaToMarkdownConverter program against that prior to running the docs generator (instead of manually doing this)\r\n- [ ] Remove the TestFramework namespace from the docs (easy to do in the docfx json file i think)\r\n- [ ] Version the Docs URLs, for example, the current docs are here http://lucenenet.apache.org/docs/3.0.3/Index.html, the 4.8.0 ones should be here: http://lucenenet.apache.org/docs/4.8.0/Index.html , this will need to be part of the docs build script to pass along a version number, see 2nd section in this comment https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206#issuecomment-393800264\r\n- [ ] Figure out how to host the docs site\r\n\r\nAdditional tasks (nice to have):\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update the build server to generate all docs + website + zips, deploy to staging, have a vote, etc... see comment: https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/pull/206#issuecomment-393834720\r\n- [ ] Differentiate between .NET Standard and .NET Framework. This is supposed to be possible with docfx though I'm unsure it will be the ideal way we want yet\r\n- [ ] Investigate overlapping namespaces with DocFx, might be that we need to ask on the DocFx GH site, see

is a branch of #191 and supersedes that pull request. To build this branch, see the instructions on #191.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to work on the API here to keep from releasing several successive releases with breaking API changes. Once the API is relatively stable, we can merge to master and create a release that can be consumed without having to worry about so many breaking API changes between releases.\r\n\r\n> DO NOT MERGE this pull request until the API is stable and failing tests are addressed.\r\n\r\n## API Polishing\r\n\r\nThis fixes several API issues that were making Lucene.Net deviate from looking like a normal .NET application - mainly by using properties and methods the way that are specified in the [MSDN guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229054(v=vs.100).aspx) and following .NET naming conventions for properties, methods, fields, parameters, and types. Also several types are being renamed and/or moved to address naming collisions, incorrect porting corrected, bugs fixed, and other issues such as CLS compliance are being addressed.\r\n\r\nThese specific changes are being made that make Lucene.Net differ from Lucene because they are framework conventions that are different between Java and .NET:\r\n\r\n1. Interfaces start with \"I\"\r\n2. `Size()` changed to `Count` or `Length` property\r\n3. `Comparator` changed to `Comparer` on all classes, interfaces , properties, methods, documentation and comments\r\n4. Type names in methods and properties being .NETified. For example instead of `.SetLongValue(long)`, we will have `.SetInt64Value()`. NOTE: This isn't done yet. I could use some advice on if or how this one should be done, since `WriteVInt64()` admittedly looks odd. The class and interface names are being changed to match. In certain special cases, type names are being changed to differentiate \"Single\" (the datatype) from \"Singular\" (meaning one) because there are types in the same context that use both, and it would be confusing.\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nThis branch is now more stable than master.\r\n\r\nThe Test Framework is now randomizing Codec, InfoStream, Time Zone, and Culture (the same as Lucene). This has revealed many new issues, most of which have now been addressed. There are now no tests failing constantly, and a few that fail randomly.\r\n\r\n#### Key:\r\n\r\n1. Type and Member Accessibility\r\n2. Properties vs Methods\r\n3. Properties vs Fields\r\n4. Method, Property, Field, and Parameter Naming Conventions\r\n5. Class and Interface Naming Conventions\r\n6. Eliminate Nullable Enums, if Possible (see [this discussion](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1795657/c-sharp-enums-nullable-or-unknown-value))\r\n7. Parameter and Return Types (IDictionary and IList rather than Dictionary and List)\r\n8. Change Property Setters with no Getter (per MSDN, this is not a good practice) - either add a getter or change to a setter method\r\n9. CLS Compliant\r\n10. Compiler Warnings Remaining (corresponding test project included)\r\n11. TODOs Remaining (search for `LUCENENET TODO|LUCENE TO-DO` using the regular expression option to find them)\r\n-------\r\n\r\n| Project | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 |\r\n|  :---      | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |  :---: | \r\n| Core                       | X |  | X |  | X |  | X | X | X | 14 | 117 |\r\n| Analysis.Common  | X |  | X |  | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 33 |\r\n| Analysis.Stempel    | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 2 |\r\n| Classification          | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 0 |\r\n| Codecs                   | X | X | X |  | X |  | X | X | X | 0 | 18 |\r\n| Expressions            | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 0 |\r\n| Facet                      |  X |  | X |  | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 1 |\r\n| Grouping               |  X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 0 |\r\n| Highlighter            |  X | X | X |  | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 6 |\r\n| Join                        | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 0 |\r\n| Memory                 |  X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 0 |\r\n| Misc                       |  X | X | X | X | X |  | X | X | X | 4 | 4 |\r\n| Queries                  |  X | X | X |  | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 15 |\r\n| QueryParser           |  X | X | X |  | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 21 |\r\n| Sandbox                 |  X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 0 |\r\n| Spatial                    |  X | X | X |  | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 3 |\r\n| Suggest                  | X | X | X |  | X | X | X | X | X | 0 | 4 |\r\n| Test Framework      | N/A | N/A | N/A |  N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A | 4 | 5 |\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nDo note that currently this branch has more failing tests than master. In fact, the test suite is currently crashing for several tests, making the whole thing bomb before it can finish. Right now, the priority is finishing the API changes before addressing these problems. \r\n\r\nHowever, if you would like to help out by debugging the failing tests, please fork [this branch](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/tree/api-work) and submit the pull request back here. Due to the fast changing state of the API, please fix one bug at a time and submit the pull request to [this branch](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/tree/api-work) (not master) ASAP.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Comments\r\n\r\nAlso up-for-grabs is to complete the documentation comments in the following sections:\r\n\r\n1. Lucene.Net.Core (project)\r\n   1. Codecs (namespace)\r\n   2. Index (namespace) (Except for types starting with letter A-D, LiveIndexWriterConfig, IndexWriter, IndexWriterConfig, IndexReader, and TieredMergePolicy)\r\n   3. Search (namespace)\r\n   4. Support (namespace)\r\n   5. Util (namespace) (Except for Util.Fst)\r\n2. Lucene.Net.Codecs (project)\r\n\r\nWhile it is assumed that the documentation comments for the other projects are finished, they could probably all use a review.\r\n\r\nThe automated Java converter brought much of the comment structure over, however some comments have been left behind in Lucene, and they need to be formatted and corrected to match [MSDN's guidelines](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5ast78ax.aspx). Some common issues that need to be addressed:\r\n\r\n1. Change `seealso` to `see` (`seealso` are for the links that go at the bottom of the documentation page, not the direct links within the content).\r\n2. `{@code paramName}` or `<code>paramName</code> need to be changed to `<paramref name=\"paramName\">`. Note that not all of the \"code\" are parameter names, and the normal case need to be in `<c></c>` tags for single line and `<code></code>` tags for multiline code examples. Do note the code also needs to be converted to match our API.\r\n3. `{@link TypeName}` need to be changed to the appropriate `<see cref=\"TypeName\"/>` or anchor tag (if external).\r\n4. Many times in the documentation, the types are referred to (in Pascal case) with no link. In these cases a link to the type should be added (change `TypeName` to `<see cref=\"TypeName\"/>`).\r\n\r\n> Be sure to check the comments against [Lucene 4.8.0](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/tree/releases/lucene-solr/4.8.0/lucene) to ensure they are correct and complete!\r\n\r\nPull requests should be directed to [this branch](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/tree/api-work) (not master).\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-25T06:29:28Z","updated_at":"2017-04-28T20:53:44Z","closed_at":"2017-04-25T11:50:56Z","merged_at":"2017-04-25T11:50:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"1495bff05968258e1b24b3a1f9c0f07713ba8caf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/203/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/203/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/203/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/1495bff05968258e1b24b3a1f9c0f07713ba8caf","head":{"label":"apache:api-work","ref":"api-work","sha":"1495bff05968258e1b24b3a1f9c0f07713ba8caf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache

adds the remaining Grouping classes, the Grouping tests, as well as the support classes (`TreeSet` and `LinkedHashMap`) required by Grouping. 12/12 test are passing.\r\n\r\nThere is also a sweeping bug fixed in the test framework - the `TestUtil.RandomRealisticUnicodeString()` method was returning only random series of numbers, not Unicode characters. Fortunately, the impact wasn't as bad as I thought it would be - there are ~6 additional tests solution-wide failing due to this fix.\r\n\r\nI am posting this as a pull request rather than pushing it to master for 2 reasons:\r\n\r\n1. I am hoping it helps get #191 merged to master sooner (@conniey, let me know if it would be more helpful or harmful to merge this before you finish the .NET core integration).\r\n2. There are a few things about this that need more work and further discussion.\r\n\r\nAPI Refactoring\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDue to the liberal use of Java wildcard generics, it was a challenge putting something together that would compile. One of the solutions I came up with was to use .NET covariance to fix some of the issues. Unfortunately, covariance in .NET is only supported on interfaces and the fact that the Lucene designers made everything into abstract classes didn't help. Basically, we now have abstract classes that are backed by another abstraction (interfaces).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, since the Collector abstraction is also an abstract class rather than an interface, it means these Collector interfaces cannot also be Collectors (which means lots of casting). This is because interfaces cannot inherit abstract classes. So, there are 3 different ways to go from here to get rid of most of the casting:\r\n\r\n1. Change the Collector abstract class into an interface\r\n2. Create an interface to back the Collector, similar to what was done for Grouping\r\n3. Use a different solution than covariant interfaces to mimic Java wildcard generics\r\n\r\nI am hoping someone can present another option than covariant interfaces that doesn't result in lots of casting, but that may not be a possibility. IMO, it would make more sense to change Collector into an interface (since it has no code and only public members) than to create a backing interface, which would help to avoid confusion over the double-abstraction.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean is that pretty much every place where Collector abstract class is used now would need to change to the Collector interface to ensure that covariant Collector interfaces can inherit Collector, thus making them into a Collector. Keeping a Collector abstract class around after it is essentially no longer called out anywhere (except in subclasses) might be cause for confusion.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be helpful if someone would work with Grouping and let us know of any other issues with the API that could be improved.\r\n\r\nC5's TreeSet & TreeMap\r\n----\r\n\r\nI brought over the TreeSet and TreeDictionary from C5, along with the applicable tests. Unfortunately, this drags most of the C5 library along with it. We could alternatively reference it via NuGet, but there is not yet .NET core support (just an open [pull request](https://github.com/sestoft/C5/pull/50)).\r\n\r\nAlso, despite being a \"set\", it does not implement `ISet`, which I have now done. It isn't a problem yet, but may eventually be needed.\r\n\r\nLinkedHashMap\r\n-----\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the `LurchTable` that worked well for an LRU cache doesn't keep track of insertion order (even when you specify that option) and therefore doesn't replace `LinkedHashMap` as was advertised. So, I ended up modifying [this solution](http://qiita.com/matarillo/items/c09e0f3e5a61f84a51e2) (the second option) to be backed by `HashMap` rather than `Dictionary` so it can support `null` keys.\r\n\r\n`LinkedHashMap`'s main reason for being is that it keeps track of the insertion order of items. We have unwittingly replaced it with `Dictionary` in several places. The fact that the tests pass is happenstance - `Dictionary` doesn't guarantee insertion order, but if you add items only and don't delete and re-add, they will enumerate in insertion order. That said, there is nothing stopping someone from changing this behavior from one .NET version to another and we can't rely on it. We should go back and find all of the places where `LinkedHashMap` is used in Lucene where we are using Dictionary, replace, and test thoroughly.","created_at":"2016-11-07T21:45:44Z","updated_at":"2016-11-10T11:49:22Z","closed_at":"2016-11-10T11:46:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b76abca1d1d8ad041369d9da9ba3775acf1675cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/96d38effd9f91433a21ddcbd781eb7c0b0c3df02","head":{"label":"NightOwl888:grouping","ref":"grouping","sha":"96d38effd9f91433a21ddcbd781eb7c0b0c3df02","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63890962,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzg5MDk2Mg==","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"NightOwl888/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet","description":"Mirror

Prerequisites\r\n\r\n* Visual Studio 2015 with Update 3\r\n* [.NET Core 1.0.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)\r\n\r\n## Building Lucene.Net.Portable.sln\r\n\r\nThis will build Lucene.NET for .NET Standard and .NET 4.5.1.\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\n\r\nThere is a build script, `Build.ps1` that performs build steps. For more information, execute `Get-Help Build.ps1 -Full` in Powershell.\r\n\r\n#### Building\r\n\r\n1. Go to repository root\r\n2. Execute: `Build.ps1 -CreatePackages`\r\n\r\n#### Testing\r\n\r\n* Execute all tests:  `Build.ps1 -RunTests`\r\n* Execute specific tests: `Build.ps1 -RunTests -ProjectsToTest @(\"Lucene.Net.Tests\", \"Lucene.Net.Tests.Facet\")`\r\n* Execute Manually: \r\n    1. `cd` to any of the testing projects\r\n    2. `dotnet test --where=\"Category!=LongRunningTest && Category != DtdProcessingTest && Category != HasTimeout\"`\r\n\r\n## Building Lucene.Net.sln\r\n\r\nThis will build Lucene.NET using the old projects for .NET 4.5.1. **Hopefully Lucene.Net.sln can be removed in the future because the .NET Core projects compile for .NET 4.5.1 already.**\r\n\r\n* Visual Studio\r\n   1. Open solution in Visual Studio 2015\r\n   2. Restore NuGet packages (right-click on solution, restore NuGet packages)\r\n   3. Build solution\r\n* Command Line \r\n   1. Open a Visual Studio 2015 developer command prompt\r\n   2. Restore packages using NuGet v3\r\n   3. Execute `msbuild Lucene.Net.sln`\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nThese are some explicit things to highlight about changes that were made in order to get it to build for .NET Standard 1.5\r\n\r\n### Compiler preprocessors\r\n\r\nSince .NET Standard is a subset of the full .NET Framework, there are some features that are not supported, so they had to be compiled out until support for them was enabled.  The following preprocessors were added to the code:\r\n\r\n* FEATURE_SERIALIZABLE - Binary serialization (ie. `[Serializable]`) is [not supported](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/6564) in .NET Core.\r\n* FEATURE_CLONEABLE - `ICloneable` interface isn't being brought back until .NET Standard 2.0 (Spring 2017)\r\n* FEATURE_DTD_PROCESSING - `DtdProcessing.Parse` and `XmlResolver` isn't being brought back until .NET Standard 2.0 (Spring 2017). Issues [#4376](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/4376), [#10322](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/10322)\r\n* FEATURE_THREADPOOL_UNSAFEQUEUEWORKITEM - Will be added back in .NET Standard 2.0. Issue [#11633](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/11633)\r\n* FEATURE_TASKMERGESCHEDULER - [`ConcurrentMergeScheduler`](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Index/ConcurrentMergeScheduler.cs) has a lot of `Thread` management that is not supported in .NET Standard until 2.0.  This enables exclusive usage of [TaskMergeScheduler](https://github.com/apache/lucenenet/blob/master/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Index/TaskMergeScheduler.cs).\r\n* FEATURE_EMBEDDED_RESOURCE - Embedding resources using .xproj/project.json results in different resource names than using .csproj.  This was added to support existing logic in Lucene.Net.sln.\r\n* NET451 - Using xproj, this compiler processor is automatically defined but had to be added to the csproj because support for setting  `CultureInfo.CurrentCulture` did not exist until .NET 4.6.\r\n\r\n### ICU and Build Architecture\r\n\r\n* Replaced with ICU4NET with [icu-dotnet](https://github.com/sillsdev/icu-dotnet) because Visual C++ does not exist on .NET Core.  I migrated their code to .NET Core in this [branch on my repository](https://github.com/conniey/icu-dotnet/tree/migrateToNetStandard).\r\n\r\n### NUnit\r\n\r\n* Added `[HasTimeout]` attribute because NUnit on .NET Core does not have `[Timeout]`.  As a result, we could have tests that run forever.  See nunit/nunit#1658.  These tests are skipped during a test run using [Build.ps1's `$ExcludeTestCategoriesNetCore` parameter](https://github.com/conniey/lucenenet/blob/netcoremigration/Build.ps1#L86)\r\n* Currently, tests run against `netcoreapp1.0` because Visual Studio Test Explorer fails to show tests when they are compiled against multiple frameworks. nunit/dotnet-test-nunit#37.  It would work in the command-line though, so we have to decide whether or not to only run tests from command-line or have an experience in Visual Studio.  (We can manually edit the project.json to run  tests against net451, too, when we are executing `dotnet test` from command line. Not sure how ideal this would be.)\r\n* I had to migrate the tests to NUnit 3 because dotnet-test-nunit uses NUnit 3\r\n* At first, I tried to migrate the tests to xUnit, but there are a lot of issues.  Mainly that xUnit tests run in parallel and with the static properties in Lucene.NET tests and test framework, it made it hard to break those dependencies and run the tests reliably.\r\n\r\n## Test

16 tests are passing.\n\nI ended up porting over `DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream` and their corresponding interfaces from Java to save time. There is probably a way to make `Egothor.Stemmer` work with `BinaryReader` and `BinaryReader`, but these classes write the bytes in reverse order from Java and also do not have the corresponding `WriteUTF` and `ReadUTF` methods that use a proprietary UTF-8 format. The upside is that it now writes files that are _probably_ compatible with Java, however since these are temp files I doubt it matters very much.\n","created_at":"2016-10-03T15:18:57Z","updated_at":"2016-10-23T13:02:01Z","closed_at":"2016-10-23T13:02:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f06a0bb9fe4aea0a2a6f2308a7507213201b5217","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/190/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/190/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/190/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/a5de6b6064e622b84c41475db04cd59aae73cf42","head":{"label":"NightOwl888:analysis-stempel","ref":"analysis-stempel","sha":"a5de6b6064e622b84c41475db04cd59aae73cf42","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63890962,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzg5MDk2Mg==","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"NightOwl888/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet","description":"Mirror

fixes the 23 Analysis tests that were failing all of the time, and 1 test that was failing about 10% of the time.\n\n> NOTE: This includes the commits from #185.\n\nAlso, the CharArraySet and CharArrayMap classes were refactored:\n1. An `ICharArrayMap` interface was introduced to allow CharArraySet to hold a reference to CharArrayMap without knowing its generic type.\n2. A `MapValue` class was introduced to emulate Java's ability to put an `object()` instance into a generic type, whose only purpose is to make the value non-null (since null has a special meaning and default(TValue) would break the null check anyway if we were dealing with value types).\n3. A `ValueCollection` class and `ValueEnumerator` class were introduced to house the logic that converts the `MapValue` to a real value, and to override the `ToString()` method to output the correct representation of the data for the tests.\n4. A similar `KeyCollection` and `KeyEnumerator` were introduced to break the infinite recursion between CharArraySet/CharArrayMap without consuming RAM.\n5. Overloads were created for all main methods of CharArrayMap and CharArraySet for `char[]`, `ICharSequence`, `string` and `object`. \n6. Extension methods were created for the main methods for string-able value types, converting them to strings automatically using the invariant culture.\n7. The generic closing type of CharArrayMap and CharArraySet was changed from object to string (similar to how it was done in Lucene.Net 3.0.3).\n8. Added a `CharArrayMap` class to house the static methods and public classes of `CharArrayMap<TValue>` so they can be accessed without specifying a generic class type for CharArrayMap (`CharArrayMap.Copy(x)` rather than `CharArrayMap<object>.Copy(x)`).\n\n> NOTE: I know this looks a lot like a .NET 1.0 type with all of the overloads, but I ran some experiments and determined that it is 11x - 17x faster to do have several overloads than to have a single overload (whether it is generic or object) that checks the type and takes the appropriate action.\n","created_at":"2016-10-01T13:11:01Z","updated_at":"2016-10-02T15:02:39Z","closed_at":"2016-10-02T15:02:39Z","merged_at":"2016-10-02T15:02:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"87d05125bb8d3df1bbe2b42bd6893b7d123b0b28","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/189/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/189/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/189/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/87d05125bb8d3df1bbe2b42bd6893b7d123b0b28","head":{"label":"NightOwl888:analysis-bugz","ref":"analysis-bugz","sha":"87d05125bb8d3df1bbe2b42bd6893b7d123b0b28","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63890962,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzg5MDk2Mg==","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"NightOwl888/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet","description":"Mirror

the 64 failing Facet tests, refactored the public API to be more .NET friendly (changing methods to properties and vice versa, renaming Size to Count, MaxSize to Capacity, Close() to Dispose(), etc.),

may need attention - the original implementation used a LinkedHashMap as a cache and switched it out for HashMap when the size grew large. The LRUHashMap is the closest thing we currently have to LinkedHashMap, but using it doesn't work. A plain old generic Dictionary works fine, but may use more RAM than the designers intended.\n","created_at":"2016-09-26T07:52:45Z","updated_at":"2016-10-04T20:01:45Z","closed_at":"2016-10-04T20:01:45Z","merged_at":"2016-10-04T20:01:45Z","merge_commit_sha":"ddfb46c1024e57609f2c3df26ffd921ac95bb663","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/188/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/188/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/188/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/ddfb46c1024e57609f2c3df26ffd921ac95bb663","head":{"label":"NightOwl888:facet-bugz","ref":"facet-bugz","sha":"ddfb46c1024e57609f2c3df26ffd921ac95bb663","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63890962,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzg5MDk2Mg==","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"NightOwl888/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet","description":"Mirror

pull request contains Lucene.Net.Misc, Lucene.Net.Suggest, and Lucene.Net.Memory. There is also some cleanup of the compiler warnings in Analysis/QueryParser as well as renaming the QueryParser namespace to QueryParsers to avoid naming collisions with classes named QueryParser (similar to the Document namespace being Documents).\n\nNote that this pull request contains the commits from #185 (which has already been reviewed), so you should pull that one first so you don't have to review the same thing twice. \n# Current Status\n## Misc\n\n40 tests passing/42\n#### 2 Failing Tests\n1. Misc.Document.TestLazy() - The document is returning exactly (values \\* fields). The test [expects (values \\* fields) + 1](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/8fdf89690404c0e65784b2c5477552b9dec58591/lucene/misc/src/test/org/apache/lucene/document/TestLazyDocument.java#L122). Without knowing what the +1 is supposed to represent, this is a wild goose chase. Any ideas?\n2. Misc.Index.Sorter.TestEarlyTerminationDifferentSorter() - This test fails before it gets to the class under test due to a bug somewhere in the core. It fails about 15-20% of the time, but since the test is setup to run at least 5 times, the test fails about 90% of the time. I am unable to make it fail with manual input, so it is hard to figure out which random iteration will fail. The cause is a null reference exception due to the priority Queue being all nulls (its initial state). The UpdateBottom() method sets the Bottom member variable to null, and then the [code tries to access Bottom.Slot](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/misc-suggest/src/Lucene.Net.Core/Search/TopFieldCollector.cs#L397-L398). So, apparently some call is missing to update the priority queue and/or something is misbehaving and clearing it out. If I catch the exception, or put a null check before accessing the value (defaulting to 0), then the test passes. It seems like that null safety check should be there - or was the null check left out intentionally in Java to make it blow up when the PQ is empty?\n#### Not Yet Ported\n\nThe Misc.Store directory. There is some C++ code in there for native Windows, Unix and Posix directories. I am not sure it makes any sense to port it.\n## Suggest\n\n141 tests passing/141\n## Memory\n\n10 tests

I looked into the failing tests briefly - they are all failing due to incorrect results from the RAMUsageEstimator, not due to problems with the PackedInts class.\n\nThere is [1 FST test](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/ef889cebdeaa180d0bb232afd8e5ab3865cd41bc/src/Lucene.Net.Tests/core/Util/Fst/TestFSTs.cs#L312) that I estimate will take around 10-14 hours to run.

have completed most of the Standard and Core namespaces and managed to get the number of failing tests down to 11 (out of 251).\n\nThere is still some work to be done on CharArrrayMap and CharArraySet. One (and I suspect more) of the failing tests are because we are not passing an object reference into CharArraySet so it gets out of sync with CharArrayMap. Unfortunately it isn't easy because of the CharArrayMap is generic and CharArraySet is not. Ideas I have been kicking around:\n1. Since in Java, you would just call CharArrayMap.Copy(), CharArrayMap.UnmodifiableMap(), etc. without specifying the generic type of CharArrayMap, perhaps there should be a static CharArrayMap class that contains these methods (and make the methods themselves generic as well as extension methods for the CharArrayMap instance).\n2. One option for fixing the referencing issue would be to create a non-generic ICharArrayMap interface to pass to CharArraySet. The members would just access the generic internal type as an object member of the interface (which is really no worse than what we have now). I did this in BoboBrowse.Net, which had _many_ issues with generics such as this, and it worked well.\n\nUnfortunately, I didn't do as much cleanup work as I had hoped to here, but I hope you will be lenient since this is a WIP branch and I suspect you are chomping at the bit to get some more progress done on this. I have some urgent business to attend to and might not be available for a few days so I am leaving you with what I have so

is an improvement from PR #172.  The difference is that all the existing constructors are maintained with some additions. \n\nThis PR would allow an easier transition to using xUnit. xUnit by default, runs its tests in parallel and asynchronously. The current use of mutable static fields limits in test cases the ability to utilise this.\n- Changing existing static variables to static readonly so we are explicit that these variables are set once and do not change.\n- Change OLD_FORMAT_IMPERSONATION_IS_ACTIVE to non-static field since other tests share and use this variable\n- Change ClassEnvRule to non-static since every test class generates

have ported much of the QueryParser + the tests.\n# Current Status\n\nMost of (about 2/3) of the tests are passing. The good news is that the Classic.QueryParser is passing on all tests (except for one that I was unable to translate).\n## Not Yet Ported\n1. The entire QueryParser.Flexible namespace.\n2. The [QueryParser.Surround.Query.SrndTruncQuery.VisitMatchingTerms](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/queryparser/src/Lucene.Net.QueryParser/Surround/Query/SrndTruncQuery.cs#L87) method.\n3. The [TestDateRange](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/queryparser/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.QueryParser/Util/QueryParserTestBase.cs#L751) test for the classic QueryParser.\n## Points of Interest\n1. The [Locale and Timezone](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/queryparser/src/Lucene.Net.QueryParser/Flexible/Standard/CommonQueryParserConfiguration.cs#L77-L85) features of the QueryParser seem a bit incompatible with .NET. The TimeZone property is not actually hooked to anything since there doesn't seem to be a sensible way to use it in .NET. And in .NET we normally set the culture on the current thread or pass it to a method for a one-off. It doesn't make a lot of sense to make it a member of QueryParser, since a single parser instance could be used on different cultures just by switching the culture of the current thread. Thoughts?\n2. I refactored the [QueryParserConstants](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/queryparser/src/Lucene.Net.QueryParser/Classic/QueryParserConstants.cs#L20) a bit since it is not possible to add constants to an interface as was done in Java. I weighed the options and ended up splitting them into separate static classes, since there doesn't seem to be a way to reference them in .NET from multiple classes (at least not without a base class) without putting an identifier before the member (`Something.Constant`). I went with `RegexpToken` and `LexicalToken` based on what was in the comments, but feel free to rename them or suggest a different approach.\n3. I think that it would be best to use a `[Flags]` enum in .NET for the [`SimpleQueryParser` constants](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/queryparser/src/Lucene.Net.QueryParser/Simple/SimpleQueryParser.cs#L98-L121), since passing these flags to the API as an `int` is not very intuitive. However, currently there are 9 tests failing that all directly involve these constants and I don't want to throw another variable in to the debugging effort. I would be happy to change this as soon as the tests are passing if you agree with this assertion.\n4. I ended up adding a couple of flags to `SimpleQueryParser` to [indicate a \"not set\" state](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/queryparser/src/Lucene.Net.QueryParser/Simple/SimpleQueryParser.cs#L529), since it is not possible to set an enum to null in .NET and IMO a nullable variable type should not be part of a public API.\n5. I have run into a wall with debugging the 9 failing tests on the `SimpleQueryParser`. The [documentation](https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_7_0/queryparser/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/simple/SimpleQueryParser.html) and [comments](https://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/8fdf89690404c0e65784b2c5477552b9dec58591/lucene/queryparser/src/java/org/apache/lucene/queryparser/simple/SimpleQueryParser.java#L102) both indicate that passing a flag is to _enable_ the option. However, the [test names](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/queryparser/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.QueryParser/Simple/TestSimpleQueryParser.cs#L603-L696) indicate they are testing to _disable_ the feature. As a result the wrong type of query is being returned to pass the tests.\n6. I have also run into a wall with the failing tests (which are all of the tests) for the Surround.Parser.QueryParser. For example [this test](https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet/blob/queryparser/src/Lucene.Net.Tests.QueryParser/Surround/Query/Test02Boolean.cs#L128) first correctly identifies the AND token, it then immediately tries to look for a `(` and then blows up because it doesn't exist. I triple checked the code and is doing nothing more than running the initialization code and then doing this check. A little assistance would be appreciated, as I don't have the Java version setup to run to check what it _should_ do.\n","created_at":"2016-08-02T14:39:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-11T21:30:51Z","closed_at":"2016-09-11T21:30:46Z","merged_at":"2016-09-11T21:30:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"ab5c0595b64bdcaab41a604552f10dfa695e1f78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/176/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/176/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/176/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/ab5c0595b64bdcaab41a604552f10dfa695e1f78","head":{"label":"NightOwl888:queryparser","ref":"queryparser","sha":"ab5c0595b64bdcaab41a604552f10dfa695e1f78","user":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63890962,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzg5MDk2Mg==","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"NightOwl888/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"NightOwl888","id":1538288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzgyODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1538288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888","html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NightOwl888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/NightOwl888/lucenenet","description":"Mirror

`Name()`, `FieldType()`, `GetBoost()` and `BinaryValue()` into property getters for consistency with the other getters in the `IndexableField` type. So we have all properties instead of a mixed bag of properties and methods. For example...\n\n``` c#\npublic SerializableField(IndexableField field)\n{\n    name = field.Name();\n    if (field.NumericValue != null)\n    {\n        fieldsData = field.NumericValue;\n    }\n

 else\n    {\n        throw new NotSupportedException(\"Doesn't support this field type so far\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nnow looks like...\n\n``` c#\npublic SerializableField(IndexableField field)\n{\n

PR would allow an easier transition to using xUnit.  xUnit by default, runs its tests in parallel and asynchronously.  The current use of mutable static fields limits in test cases the ability to utilise this.\n- Changing existing static variables to static readonly so we are explicit that these variables are set once and do not change.\n- Change `OLD_FORMAT_IMPERSONATION_IS_ACTIVE` to non-static field since other tests share and use this variable\n- Change `ClassEnvRule` to non-static since every test class generates its own rule during test\n- Change dependent static methods in LuceneTestCase to non-static because their state depended on the state of these non-static variables\n","created_at":"2016-07-15T16:32:31Z","updated_at":"2016-08-08T18:58:24Z","closed_at":"2016-08-04T18:46:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45c161ee6720889d7d4b5582310fe8cfd4d4d562","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/issues/172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/lucenenet/statuses/de38397169db66c1caacecc23b7bfaf9a9ad9fed","head":{"label":"conniey:staticLuceneTestCase","ref":"staticLuceneTestCase","sha":"de38397169db66c1caacecc23b7bfaf9a9ad9fed","user":{"login":"conniey","id":10136526,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTM2NTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10136526?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey","html_url":"https://github.com/conniey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/conniey/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1d8582f2c65c7e7d3f62d803250943457cb75223","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":161001,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjEwMDE=","name":"lucenenet","full_name":"apache/lucenenet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/lucenenet","description":"Apache
