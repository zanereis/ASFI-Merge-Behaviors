provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n- Streamlines the configuration of `AbstractAWSProcessor` subclasses\r\n- Adds default configuration verification to `AbstractAWSCredentialsProviderProcessor` subclasses, which verifies that the relevant AWS service client can be created and the region has been set (if applicable).\r\n- Adds specific verification to perform actual listing/retrieval/invocation for `GetDynamoDB`, `FetchS3Object`, `InvokeAWSGatewayApi`\r\n\r\nSince the AWS service clients do not support a mode of checking API connections without actually performing the API call, I chose not to add any additional verification to processors that perform writes (e.g., `PutDynamoDB` or `PutS3Object`).\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9354 Removes the `material-design-icons` dependency from `package.json` in `nifi-registry-web-ui`.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-registry-bootstrap.js` imports the Material Design font from the `covalent/core` module, which supports application usage of icons using the Angular `mat-icon` component. The `material-design-icons` dependency is 31 MB compressed and almost 400 MB uncompressed, consisting of over 89,000 files.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdds config verification support to:\r\n- `GCPCredentialsControllerService` - failure can be seen if providing valid but incomplete JSON\r\n- `ConsumeGCPubSub` - Added steps for parsing the subscriber name from the Subscription, and creating the Subscriber\r\n- `PublishGCPubSub` - Added step for creating the Publisher\r\n- `PutBigQueryBatch/PutBigQueryStreaming` - Added a step for creating the BigQuery client service\r\n- `DeleteGCSObject/PutGCSObject` - Added a step for creating the Storage client service\r\n- `FetchGCSObject` - Added steps for creating the Storage client service and actually fetching the object (the fetched bytes are displayed in a success message)\r\n- `ListGCSBucket` - Added steps for creating the Storage client service and actually listing the bucket, displaying the number of listed blobs in the success message.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9342 Upgrades direct dependencies on Netty from 4.1.65 to 4.1.69 and upgrades existing dependency overrides from Netty 3.6.9 and 3.7.1 to 3.10.6. Additional changes include new transitive dependency overrides in several modules to depend on the current Netty 3 and Netty 4 versions defined in root Maven configuration properties. These updates address several potential vulnerabilities associated with earlier Netty versions.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9332 Corrects `SecureHasher` unit test methods annotated with `EnabledIfSystemProperty` to honor the annotation. Removing the `GroovyTestCase` parent class causes the JUnit 5 runner to handle the test methods as designed. Additional changes include replacing `shouldFail()` with `assertThrows()`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9331 Corrects `ThreadUtils.createStackTrace()` handling of [MonitorInfo.getLockedStackFrame()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/management/MonitorInfo.html#getLockedStackFrame--) in cases where the method returns `null`. Changes include using `Objects.equals()` to handle comparison of nullable arguments, removing unused arguments, and adding a unit test for `ThreadUtils` to confirm expected behavior. This change corrects behavior of the `LongRunningTaskMonitor` and other components that gather thread information.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9326 Adds a `Socket Keep Alive` property to the `ListenSyslog` processor to support enabling TCP socket keep alive probes. The property instructs the `NettyEventServerFactory` to set the [SO_KEEPALIVE](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/SocketOptions.html#SO_KEEPALIVE) channel option for the socket bootstrap configuration. The property defaults to `false` to maintain current behavior. As noted in the property description, the details of socket keep alive settings are specific to the underlying operating system.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

In the aforementioned circumstances, connection cleanup/reuse has been included. I ran the solution using FetchSFTP, and the number of keep-alive, reader, and sftp-threads was exactly one during the run and they disappeared after the cleanup.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

If the property is set to true and the request method is GET, it will update the FlowFile's filename with a value fetched from the url. In ideal situation it will be the last element of the path, but I tried to prepare for edge cases, so for example for a \"bare url\" without path and query params it will be the hostname.\r\n\r\nThere are two things that I wasn't sure about:\r\n- In this processor boolean properties can either start with uppercase or lowercase letter. I wasn't sure which one to use, so I've checked out other processors and the ones I saw used lowercase so I used that one. Although it raises the question that wouldn't it worth to make them consistent?\r\n- It seems to me one processor means strictly one test class. I wanted to write a parameterized test but with junit4 a separate class needs to be created. I tried to write it in HTTPInvokeTest without @Parameterized, but it became really hacky so I decided to stay with the separate class approach. Is it good like that?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what do you think about my two questions and of course also about the whole pr.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

According to the release notes it shouldn't lack any additional functionality (I verified the Guava version avoids [JAVA-2923](https://datastax-oss.atlassian.net/browse/JAVA-2923))\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-21T16:29:57Z","updated_at":"2021-10-22T15:32:58Z","closed_at":"2021-10-22T07:52:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a26fcf6afbd1c27a6290ef7aff2ed233e38a425","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2446989579,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDQ2OTg5NTc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/hacktoberfest-accepted","name":"hacktoberfest-accepted","color":"2DA44E","default":false,"description":"Hacktoberfest

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Adding PublishGCPubSubLite and ConsumeGCPubSubLite processors\r\n\r\nThis pull request is adding two processors to interact with GCP Pub/Sub Lite. I initially thought about improving the existing processors but since it uses quite different APIs, I decided to go with new processors.\r\n\r\nI did some extensive testing in a GCP environment and it seems to be working as expected including under high load and with concurrent tasks.\r\n\r\nPlease note that I had to use the compute engine credentials or the application credentials. If providing a service account JSON payload/file in the controller service, it seems that some gRPC calls are ignoring this authentication method. It seems to be specific to Pub/Sub Lite as I was able to use the GCS, PubSub and BigQuery processors using the service account JSON file.\r\n\r\nSome screenshots of my tests:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1417\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-10-16 at 14 14 57\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11541012/137587930-f45c8304-6aea-444f-8a13-b000169f0fb4.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1782\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-10-16 at 14 16 52\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11541012/137587934-a5bf6886-d0b8-4f75-8bc1-68aa2cddd490.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1785\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-10-16 at 14 17 06\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11541012/137587939-be564e74-61ff-477e-88c2-1eee2bfb9546.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"756\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-10-16 at 14 18 03\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11541012/137587947-f7c63425-fe65-496f-adc4-ddd4cebdc533.png\">\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [x] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-14T11:32:39Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T21:46:08Z","closed_at":"2022-01-18T21:46:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3656a76244bc4a0abc5542f09f220873cc2b594b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5458/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5458/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5458/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/0463e81da5d63ee9a87dd2297c6830e0ff40b2fb","head":{"label":"sedadgn:NIFI-7865","ref":"NIFI-7865","sha":"0463e81da5d63ee9a87dd2297c6830e0ff40b2fb","user":{"login":"sedadgn","id":92508554,"node_id":"U_kgDOBYORig","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92508554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn","html_url":"https://github.com/sedadgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":417103425,"node_id":"R_kgDOGNx-QQ","name":"nifi","full_name":"sedadgn/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sedadgn","id":92508554,"node_id":"U_kgDOBYORig","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/92508554?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn","html_url":"https://github.com/sedadgn","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sedadgn/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sedadgn/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7322 Adds `SignContentPGP` and `VerifyContentPGP` Processors to the `nifi-pgp-processors` module and includes related updates to `DecryptContentPGP` and `EncryptContentPGP`.\r\n\r\nThe `SignContentPGP` Processor supports the following features:\r\n\r\n- Configurable `Signing Strategy` property supporting `SIGNED` messages with signature and message, or `DETACHED` signatures\r\n- Configurable `Compression Algorithm` supporting OpenPGP compression options\r\n- Configurable `File Encoding` support `BINARY` or `ASCII` Armor encoding\r\n- Configurable `Hash Algorithm` for signature generation supporting a subset of RFC 4880 options based on current security best practices: `SHA256`, `SHA384`, and `SHA512`, with `SHA512` as the default value\r\n- Configurable `Private Key Service` requiring a PGP Private Key Service\r\n- Configurable `Private Key ID` supporting standard 16 character hexadecimal key identifiers\r\n- Writing PGP signature algorithm FlowFile attributes based on configured values\r\n\r\nThe `VerifyContentPGP` Processor supports the following features:\r\n\r\n- Configurable `Public Key Service` which the processor uses to find matching PGP Public Keys using the key identifier found on OpenPGP signature packets\r\n- Writing PGP signature algorithm FlowFile attributes based on parsed values\r\n\r\nThe `DecryptContentPGP` Processor includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- New `Decryption Strategy` property, defaulting to `DECRYPTED`, maintaining the current default behavior of decrypting content and unpacking literal data packets without signature verification\r\n- `PACKAGED` setting for `Decryption Strategy` instructing the processor to write decrypted contents as an OpenPGP message to support sending to `VerifyContentPGP` when signature verification is expected after decryption\r\n\r\nThe `EncryptContentPGP` Processor includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- Internal detection of OpenPGP packets in FlowFile contents to support encryption after signing without wrapping the content inside a new PGP Literal Data packet\r\n\r\nAll new processors and features include unit tests to demonstrate expected behavior.\r\n\r\nNIFI-7322 included a request to support the Cleartext Signature Framework described in [RFC 4880 Section 7](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880#section-7), however this capability is not included for several reasons.  The Cleartext Signature Framework, also described as [clearsigning](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/r684.html) in GPG documentation, is not suitable for generalized processing.  Clearsigning requires text input and involves specialized end-of-line handling. Clearsigning also appends the signature to the end of the message in a format specific to GPG processing.  As mentioned in RFC 4880 Section 7, [RFC 3156](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3156) describes a more generalized standard for packaging signature and content using MIME formatting.  Using standard OpenPGP message formatting for signed information provides the widest compatibility across OpenPGP implementations, and also supports any handling any type in input contents.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Adds configuration verification to AbstractListProcessor and subclasses_\r\n\r\nThe following processors will now support verifying their configuration by performing an unfiltered and filtered listing:\r\n- ListFile\r\n- ListSFTP\r\n- ListFTP\r\n- ListAzureBlobStorage\r\n- ListAzureDataLakeStorage\r\n\r\nRunning config verification will report failures during listing, or an explanation of success in a format like \"Found X objects matching the filter.  Of those, Y match the filter.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-11T19:12:15Z","updated_at":"2021-10-21T16:35:43Z","closed_at":"2021-10-21T16:22:51Z","merged_at":"2021-10-21T16:22:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2f8f97b10a3e5f45d31cebf743e5240ca215b85","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2446989579,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDQ2OTg5NTc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/hacktoberfest-accepted","name":"hacktoberfest-accepted","color":"2DA44E","default":false,"description":"Hacktoberfest

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9285 Upgrades transitive dependencies on ZooKeeper 3.4 to [3.4.14](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.14/releasenotes.html). As described in the ZooKeeper releases notes, this version addresses a small number of bug fixes and includes other transitive dependency updates. ZooKeeper client 3.4 is compatible with at least ZooKeeper Server 3.4 and 3.5. This update avoids moving to ZooKeeper 3.5 for now in order to maintain the widest level of compatibility and the least amount of changes.\r\n\r\nThis change impacts a selected number of NiFi extension components that depend on versions of ZooKeeper between 3.4.5 and 3.4.13.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9284 Adds `qlog.conf` to `src/test/resources` in `nifi-framework-core` in order to set the default logging level for QuestDB to `ERROR`. The following test classes now produce significantly fewer log messages:\r\n\r\n- `EmbeddedQuestDbStatusHistoryRepositoryForComponentsTest`\r\n- `EmbeddedQuestDbStatusHistoryRepositoryForNodeTest`\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-05T18:00:25Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T21:50:55Z","closed_at":"2021-10-06T07:40:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"89c6af60043ccb0edf12c1986496f72c54525bec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2446989579,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDQ2OTg5NTc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/hacktoberfest-accepted","name":"hacktoberfest-accepted","color":"2DA44E","default":false,"description":"Hacktoberfest

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9283 Excludes Log4j 1.2 using Maven coordinates `log4j:log4j` from all referencing modules and also upgrades older versions of Log4j2 to 2.14.1.\r\n\r\nThe Encrypt Config Tool included direct usage of Log4j 1.2 and now depends on SLF4J Simple logging. Several unit tests included unnecessary references to the Log4j 1.2 BasicConfigurer.\r\n\r\nThese changes address several vulnerabilities associated with optional Socket Appenders  in Log4j 1.2 and earlier versions of Log4j2.\r\n\r\nThe Maven Enforcer Plugin configuration also includes `log4j:log4j` as a banned dependency to avoid potential future inclusion of Log4j 1.2.  As noted in comments and changes, `log4j-over-slf4j` should be used to provide a runtime bridge from Log4j to SLF4J.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-10-05T17:06:06Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T21:50:45Z","closed_at":"2021-10-06T15:17:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"85ec2d0072f24800a526b8b4a8312e116b1d4bd4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2446989579,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNDQ2OTg5NTc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/labels/hacktoberfest-accepted","name":"hacktoberfest-accepted","color":"2DA44E","default":false,"description":"Hacktoberfest

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9271 Upgrades the version of Quartz referenced in MiNiFi from 2.2.1 to 2.3.2 in order to address associated vulnerability  CVE-2019-13990. The aligns with the version of Quartz used in the rest of NiFi.\r\n\r\nQuartz 2.3.2 depends on `com.mchange:c3p0:0.9.5.4`, which makes the current exclusion of `c3p0:c3p0` not applicable. The [c3p0 library](https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/) is available for redistribution under the compatible Eclipse Public License 1.0, and it is already included through other dependencies, removing the need for the exclusion.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9254 Updates the default Sensitive Properties Algorithm and Sensitive Properties Key values for NiFi Stateless to more secure settings.  Following the default configuration of the NiFi framework, `NIFI_PBKDF2_AES_GCM_256` is the new standard Sensitive Properties Algorithm, replacing the deprecated `PBEWITHMD5AND256BITAES-CBC-OPENSSL` setting.\r\n\r\nChanges also include replacing a hard-coded default Sensitive Properties Key with a random generation key.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include a new unit test for parsing Stateless properties and confirming random Sensitive Properties Key generation.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-09-29T19:30:36Z","updated_at":"2021-10-01T19:55:33Z","closed_at":"2021-10-01T19:55:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d00340598c2e0e85ec78a2b347e50bcfaff0e50d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5424/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5424/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5424/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/341d81eea6334657f5a47ae239c6a6b77c1f8fbb","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9254","ref":"NIFI-9254","sha":"341d81eea6334657f5a47ae239c6a6b77c1f8fbb","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9253 Corrects `SSLSocketChannel` to avoid intermittent unit test and runtime failures related to TLSv1.3.  The `available()` method implementation resulted in sporadic unit test failures for TLSv1.3 due to partial reads from the connected channel while attempting to determine available bytes.  Partial reads produced incomplete TLS messages, causing AES-GCM decryption failures reported as `Tag mismatch` messages with `SSLException`.\r\n\r\nThe previous unit test used a loop for checking the `available()` bytes, causing intermittent failures. The updated unit test class includes separate methods with and without calls to `available()` in order to reproduce the potential problem. The corrected `available()` method in `SSLSocketChannel` avoids direct reads from the socket channel and instead returns the size of the application data buffer.  This approach aligns with the documentation for `InputStream.available()`, which states that the method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that may be read, without blocking. Additional changes include refactoring and isolating the `readChannel()` and `unwrap()` methods in `SSLSocketChannel` for more streamlined handling of buffer underflow status.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9241 Refactors the [Cross Site Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) mitigation strategy to use a random token cookie with a custom HTTP request header to implement the [Double Submit Cookie](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#double-submit-cookie) pattern. The implementation leverages standard Spring Security CSRF filtering with a custom CSRF Token Repository.\r\n\r\nThis approach replaces the current strategy based on comparing the `Authorization` header with the JSON Web Token provided in a cookie header. The new strategy sets a random token in a cookie named `__Secure-Request-Token` and expects browser clients to send the value in a custom HTTP Header named `Request-Token`. This strategy applies to both Token-based and Certificate-based authentication, removing the need for a custom Cross Origin Request Filter configuration implemented for NIFI-5595 in #3024. As a result of removing the CORS Filter, the HTTP `OPTIONS` method is now unnecessary and disallowed.\r\n\r\nThese changes also remove the need for storing the NiFi JSON Web Token in sessionStorage. Instead of storing the token, the browser client stores the session expiration time in seconds, parsed from the `exp` claim of the JSON Web Token. This approach maintains support for indicating login status based on the presence of a token in sessionStorage, while eliminating the need to store the entire token. With Token-based authentication supported through a cookie, multiple browser tabs can be opened for an authentication session.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include refactoring Request URI construction using a new class named `RequestUriBuilder`. This class supports building a URI based on request information and optional proxy headers. `RequestUriBuilder` provides consistent URI construction and path resolution for both REST Resource classes as well as cookie paths.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9251 Adds an `AuthenticationManager` Bean definition to the NiFi Registry Spring Security configuration to avoid unnecessary automatic configuration, which generates and logs a random password. NiFi Registry authentication does not use the generated password, so this update clarifies the expected behavior and removes unexpected log messages.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdd hook to `AbstractHadoopProcessor.resetHDFSResources()`, allowing subclasses to operate on `FileSystem` after initialization.  Processor `PutHDFS` uses this hook to query the HDFS endpoint for default ACL.  If a default ACLis present, log warning when PutHDFS umask is configured, as HDFS ignores it by design.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-6617 Refactors the configuration properties for Encrypted Repositories and reduces duplication in implementing classes. Notable highlights include the addition of a `nifi-repository-encryption` module under `nifi-common`, rewritten Encrypted Repository configuration details in the User Guide, and significant reduction in implementation code.\r\n\r\nThe new configuration properties provide the ability to enable encryption for all repositories using a single set of properties. These properties include an Encryption Protocol Version, which represents the combination of cipher algorithms and repository classes that provide repository encryption. The new properties also support configuring a shared Key Provider, as opposed to a separate Key Provider for each type of repository. Based of the lack of documentation for the `FileBasedKeyProvider`, and the lack of inherent security in the `StaticKeyProvider`, the new configuration properties support the `KEYSTORE` Key Provider implementation based on the current java.security.KeyStore implementation.\r\n\r\nThe new configuration approach and implementation classes maintain backward compatibility with current repository encryption properties.  The internal implementation supports falling back to the existing per-repository configuration properties when found, allowing existing deployments to be upgraded.\r\n\r\nCurrent interfaces and classes supporting encryption and decryption contained a large amount of duplicate code, with some subtle differences. The new `RepositoryEncryptor` interface provides the high-level contract for encryption and decryption operations.  Implementing classes support the current cipher algorithm approach, using AES/CTR for stream-based repositories and AES/GCM for byte-array-based repositories. The new `RecordMetadataReader` interface abstracts the process of reading serialized record metadata, and implementations provide an approach to reading serialized Java objects that maintains backward compatibility. These changes minimize the amount of code necessary to implement the current encryption strategy. Additional minor changes removed the need for the `CryptoUtils` class and associated unit tests.\r\n\r\nThe rewritten section of the User Guide removes the previous experimental warnings associated with repository encryption, but retains notes about potential performance impacts.  Additional documentation updates a section of the Administrator's Guide describing the new Repository Encryption Properties. The User Guide no longer describes the `StaticKeyProvider` or `FileBasedKeyProvider`, which should be considered deprecated.\r\n\r\nBoth the User Guide and Administrator's Guide provide example property settings, which should be helpful in evaluating these changes.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
