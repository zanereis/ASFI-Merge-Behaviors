ProcessFn did not explicitly invoke the underlying fn's `@Setup` and `@Teardown` methods - it was assuming that those methods would get invoked on that fn externally.

have lifecycle methods of ProcessFn delegate to the underlying fn.\r\n\r\nAlso, adds a getter for fn (a runner may need it to create a proper ProcessContext when creating the

this update Python BoundedSource/RangeTracker API can report consumed and remaining number of split points while performing a source read operations.

overview is available at https://s.apache.org/beam-fn-api\r\n\r\nI would start by looking at the API/object model definitions found in [beam_fn_api.proto](https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam/blob/fn_api/sdks/common/fn-api/src/main/proto/beam_fn_api.proto)\r\n\r\nThen depending on your interest, look at the following:\r\n* [FnHarness.java](https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam/blob/fn_api/sdks/java/harness/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/fn/harness/FnHarness.java) is the main entry point.\r\n* [org.apache.beam.fn.harness.data](https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam/tree/fn_api/sdks/java/harness/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/fn/harness/data) contains the most interesting bits of code since it is able to multiplex a gRPC stream into multiple logical streams of elements bound for multiple concurrent process bundle requests. It also contains the code to take multiple logical outbound streams and multiplex them back onto a gRPC stream.\r\n* [org.apache.beam.runners.core](https://github.com/lukecwik/incubator-beam/tree/fn_api/sdks/java/harness/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/runners/core) contains additional runners akin to the DoFnRunner found in runners-core to support sources and gRPC endpoints.\r\n\r\nUnless your really interested in how domain sockets, epoll, nio channel factories or how stream readiness callbacks work in gRPC, I would avoid the packages org.apache.beam.fn.harness.channel and org.apache.beam.fn.harness.stream. Similarly I would avoid org.apache.beam.fn.harness.fn and org.apache.beam.fn.harness.fake as they don't add anything meaningful to the api.\r\n\r\nCode package descriptions:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.beam.fn.harness.FnHarness: main entry point\r\norg.apache.beam.fn.harness.control: Control service client and individual request handlers\r\norg.apache.beam.fn.harness.data: Data service client and logical stream multiplexing\r\norg.apache.beam.runners.core: Additional runners akin to the DoFnRunner found in runners-core to support sources and gRPC endpoints\r\norg.apache.beam.fn.harness.logging: Logging client implementation and JUL logging handler adapter\r\norg.apache.beam.fn.harness.channel: gRPC channel management\r\norg.apache.beam.fn.harness.stream: gRPC stream management\r\norg.apache.beam.fn.harness.fn: Java 8 functional interface extensions\r\n```\r\n\r\nBe sure to do all of the following to help us incorporate your contribution\r\nquickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Make sure the PR title is formatted like:\r\n   `[BEAM-<Jira issue #>] Description of pull request`\r\n - [x] Make sure tests pass via `mvn clean verify`. (Even better, enable\r\n       Travis-CI on your fork and ensure the whole test matrix passes).\r\n - [ ] Replace `<Jira issue #>` in the title with the actual Jira issue\r\n       number, if there is
