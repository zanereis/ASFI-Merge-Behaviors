What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we can't encode top level null object into internal row, as Spark SQL doesn't allow row to be null, only its columns can be null.\n\nThis is not a problem before, as we assume the input object is never null. However, for outer join, we do need the semantics of null object.\n\nThis PR fixes this problem by making both join sides produce a single column, i.e. nest the logical plan output(by `CreateStruct`), so that we have an extra level to represent top level null obejct.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew test in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn benchmarks involving tables with very wide and complex schemas (thousands of columns, deep nesting), I noticed that significant amounts of time (order of tens of seconds per task) were being spent generating comments during the code generation phase.\n\nThe root cause of the performance problem stems from the fact that calling toString() on a complex expression can involve thousands of string concatenations, resulting in huge amounts (tens of gigabytes) of character array allocation and copying.\n\nIn the long term, we can avoid this problem by passing StringBuilders down the tree and using them to accumulate output. As a short-term workaround, this patch guards comment generation behind a flag and disables comments by default (for wide tables / complex queries, these comments were being truncated prior to display and thus were not very useful).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis was tested manually by running a Spark SQL query over an empty table with a very wide schema obtained from a real workload. Disabling comments brought the per-task time down from about 16 seconds to 600 milliseconds.\n","created_at":"2016-05-31T20:24:26Z","updated_at":"2016-06-01T01:11:24Z","closed_at":"2016-06-01T00:31:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3eb8e130ef4effd504089460917002427836c8de","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13421/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13421/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13421/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db4624166bbb5e104923e77f222ce69c89c260fa","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:disable-line-comments-in-codegen","ref":"disable-line-comments-in-codegen","sha":"db4624166bbb5e104923e77f222ce69c89c260fa","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSpark currently incorrectly continues to use cached data even if the underlying data is overwritten.\n\nCurrent behavior:\n\n``` scala\nval dir = \"/tmp/test\"\nsqlContext.range(1000).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(dir)\nval df = sqlContext.read.parquet(dir).cache()\ndf.count() // outputs 1000\nsqlContext.range(10).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(dir)\nsqlContext.read.parquet(dir).count() // outputs 1000 <---- We are still using the cached dataset\n```\n\nExpected behavior:\n\n``` scala\nval dir = \"/tmp/test\"\nsqlContext.range(1000).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(dir)\nval df = sqlContext.read.parquet(dir).cache()\ndf.count() // outputs 1000\nsqlContext.range(10).write.mode(\"overwrite\").parquet(dir)\ndf.count() // outputs 1000\nsqlContext.read.parquet(dir).count() // outputs 10 <---- We are not using the cached dataset\n```\n\nThis patch fixes this bug by modifying the `ListingFileCatalog` logic that used to only compare the directory name (as opposed to individual files) while comparing 2 plans. Note that in theory, this could lead to a slight regression (for large number of files) but I didn't notice any regression for micro-benchmarks with 1000s of files.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests for overwrites and appends in `ParquetQuerySuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-05-31T19:00:45Z","updated_at":"2016-06-11T04:41:38Z","closed_at":"2016-06-11T04:41:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"db08bb14aae7ff0db649b6848ff1dcced3024bd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13419/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13419/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13419/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a21013ab27a7400c850aebe66dfcd0e7e6c2ea3c","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:drop-cache-on-write","ref":"drop-cache-on-write","sha":"a21013ab27a7400c850aebe66dfcd0e7e6c2ea3c","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen creating a Hive Table (not data source tables), a common error users might make is to specify an existing column name as a partition column. Below is what Hive returns in this case:\n\n```\nhive> CREATE TABLE partitioned (id bigint, data string) PARTITIONED BY (data string, part string);\nFAILED: SemanticException [Error 10035]: Column repeated in partitioning columns\n```\n\nCurrently, the error we issued is very confusing: \n\n```\norg.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.HiveException: MetaException(message:For direct MetaStore DB connections, we don't support retries at the client level.);\n```\n\nThis PR is to fix the above issue by capturing the usage error in `Parser`. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test case to `DDLCommandSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-05-31T18:18:02Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T20:24:58Z","closed_at":"2016-06-13T20:24:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c6a50a55c828502a889909a40d535b91216b6363","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13415/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13415/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13415/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4207e3c185a13a7f2866b0f12fcde5b28b8d948","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:partitionColumnsInTableSchema","ref":"partitionColumnsInTableSchema","sha":"f4207e3c185a13a7f2866b0f12fcde5b28b8d948","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current implementation of \"CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE USING datasource...\" is NOT creating any intermediate temporary data directory like temporary HDFS folder, instead, it only stores a SQL string in memory. Probably we should use \"TEMPORARY VIEW\" instead.\n\nThis PR assumes a temporary table has to link with some temporary intermediate data. It follows the definition of temporary table like this (from [hortonworks doc](https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.3.0/bk_dataintegration/content/temp-tables.html)):\n\n> A temporary table is a convenient way for an application to automatically manage intermediate data generated during a complex query\n\n**Example**:\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"CREATE temporary view  my_tab7 (c1: String, c2: String)  USING org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.csv.CSVFileFormat  OPTIONS (PATH '/Users/seanzhong/csv/cars.csv')\")\nscala> spark.sql(\"select c1, c2 from my_tab7\").show()\n+----+-----+\n|  c1|   c2|\n+----+-----+\n|year| make|\n|2012|Tesla|\n...\n```\n\nIt NOW prints a **deprecation warning** if \"CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE USING...\" is used.\n\n```\nscala> spark.sql(\"CREATE temporary table  my_tab7 (c1: String, c2: String)  USING org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.csv.CSVFileFormat  OPTIONS (PATH '/Users/seanzhong/csv/cars.csv')\")\n16/05/31 10:39:27 WARN SparkStrategies$DDLStrategy: CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tableName USING... is deprecated, please use CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW viewName USING... instead\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test.\n","created_at":"2016-05-31T17:42:09Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T22:23:54Z","closed_at":"2016-06-07T22:23:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54d313ac48861b376e6e2c881e243b4ecd1fc320","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13414/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13414/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13414/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/127c30962bcea93a26ed9572c5e680e3d01e0430","head":{"label":"clockfly:create_temp_view_using","ref":"create_temp_view_using","sha":"127c30962bcea93a26ed9572c5e680e3d01e0430","user":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":57937220,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NzkzNzIyMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"clockfly/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"clockfly","id":2595532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTU1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly","html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/clockfly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/clockfly/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR improves the error handling of `RowEncoder`. When we create a `RowEncoder` with a given schema, we should validate the data type of input object. e.g. we should throw an exception when a field is boolean but is declared as a string column.\n\nThis PR also removes the support to use `Product` as a valid external type of struct type.  This support is added at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/9712, but is incomplete, e.g. nested product, product in array are both not working.  However, we never officially support this feature and I think it's ok to ban it.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in `RowEncoderSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-05-31T03:38:41Z","updated_at":"2016-06-05T23:01:47Z","closed_at":"2016-06-05T23:01:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a75a0c0e6d4c289f78fc71d4c9d4bee49620aae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13401/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13401/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13401/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f23891c6fdf1a307de2a761342cf0428f97bfc15","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:bug","ref":"bug","sha":"f23891c6fdf1a307de2a761342cf0428f97bfc15","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen fetching the partitioned table, the output contains wrong results. The order of partition key values do not match the order of partition key columns in output schema. For example, \n\n``` SQL\nCREATE TABLE table_with_partition(c1 string) PARTITIONED BY (p1 string,p2 string,p3 string,p4 string,p5 string)\n\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE table_with_partition PARTITION (p1='a',p2='b',p3='c',p4='d',p5='e') SELECT 'blarr'\n\nSELECT p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, c1 FROM table_with_partition\n```\n\n```\n+---+---+---+---+---+-----+\n| p1| p2| p3| p4| p5|   c1|\n+---+---+---+---+---+-----+\n|  d|  e|  c|  b|  a|blarr|\n+---+---+---+---+---+-----+\n```\n\nThe expected result should be \n\n```\n+---+---+---+---+---+-----+\n| p1| p2| p3| p4| p5|   c1|\n+---+---+---+---+---+-----+\n|  a|  b|  c|  d|  e|blarr|\n+---+---+---+---+---+-----+\n```\n\nThis PR is to fix this by enforcing the order matches the table partition definition.\n#### How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR fixes Python examples to use the new ML Vector and Matrix APIs in the ML pipeline based algorithms.\n\nI firstly executed this shell command, `grep -r \"from pyspark.mllib\" .` and then executed them all.\nSome of tests in `ml` produced the error messages as below:\n\n```\npyspark.sql.utils.IllegalArgumentException: u'requirement failed: Input type must be VectorUDT but got org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.VectorUDT@f71b0bce.'\n```\n\nSo, I fixed them to use new ones just identically with some Python tests fixed in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12627\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested for all the examples listed by `grep -r \"from pyspark.mllib\" .`.\n","created_at":"2016-05-29T10:40:40Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:35Z","closed_at":"2016-06-11T01:31:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d363379cfcbf55b74696ec2f948dd3d331084d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13393/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13393/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13393/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0ddb1f40c0be65dea3fa6372c40fed026eb0ff7c","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-14615","ref":"SPARK-14615","sha":"0ddb1f40c0be65dea3fa6372c40fed026eb0ff7c","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

The number of branches in case when clause should be `branches.size + elseBranch.size`. \n- `maxCaseBranchesForCodegen` is the maximum boundary for enabling codegen. Thus, we should use `<=` instead of `<`.\n\nThis PR is to fix this boundary case and also add missing test cases for verifying the conf `MAX_CASES_BRANCHES`.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIt seems Parquet has been upgraded to 1.8.1 by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13280. So,  this PR enables string and binary predicate push down which was disabled due to [SPARK-11153](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11153) and [PARQUET-251](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-251) and cleans up some comments unremoved (I think by mistake).\n\nThis PR also replace the API, `fromByteArray()` deprecated in [PARQUET-251](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PARQUET-251).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in `ParquetFilters`\n","created_at":"2016-05-29T05:07:08Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:41Z","closed_at":"2016-07-05T09:01:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"79fa7b0dcb6f02878b1c1b14a0e53b2063e8023e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13389/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13389/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13389/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5611978e03f0d1a3f5e2481c07d28a645e2751d2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:parquet-1.8-followup","ref":"parquet-1.8-followup","sha":"5611978e03f0d1a3f5e2481c07d28a645e2751d2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWhen `spark.sql.hive.convertCTAS` is true, for a CTAS statement, we will create a data source table using the default source (i.e. parquet) if the CTAS does not specify any Hive storage format. However, there are two issues with this conversion logic.\n1. First, we determine if a CTAS statement defines storage format by checking the serde. However, TEXTFILE/SEQUENCEFILE does not have a default serde. When we do the check, we have not set the default serde. So, a query like `CREATE TABLE abc STORED AS TEXTFILE AS SELECT ...` actually creates a data source parquet table.\n2. In the conversion logic, we are ignoring the user-specified location.\n\nThis PR fixes the above two issues. \n\nAlso, this PR makes the parser throws an exception when a CTAS statement has a PARTITIONED BY clause. This change is made because Hive's syntax does not allow it and our current implementation actually does not work for this case (the insert operation always throws an exception because the insertion does not pick up the partitioning info).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI am adding new tests in SQLQuerySuite and HiveDDLCommandSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-05-28T23:43:17Z","updated_at":"2016-06-26T04:59:26Z","closed_at":"2016-06-02T00:57:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"19626fd362de0cfea1c217756339ecb1d7288355","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13386/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13386/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13386/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/88e742204164592eb438aa84e8413066095038dc","head":{"label":"yhuai:SPARK-14507","ref":"SPARK-14507","sha":"88e742204164592eb438aa84e8413066095038dc","user":{"login":"yhuai","id":2072857,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzI4NTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2072857?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai","html_url":"https://github.com/yhuai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yhuai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1f43562daf9454428796317203d9dcc9030a46eb","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently if some partitions of a partitioned table are used in join operation we rely on Metastore returned size of table to calculate if we can convert the operation to Broadcast join. \nif Filter can prune some partitions, Hive can prune partition before determining to use broadcast joins according to HDFS size of partitions that are involved in Query.So sparkSQL needs it that can improve join's performance for partitioned table.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nintegration tests\n","created_at":"2016-05-28T05:41:40Z","updated_at":"2017-06-04T07:05:34Z","closed_at":"2017-06-04T07:05:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"54c3e7723cc1ec73f91b0ca20ef6fedefbe8bc9f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13373/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13373/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13373/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a6e2c57019f93963ca5b4ba7607d68884ebd7c27","head":{"label":"lianhuiwang:partition_broadcast","ref":"partition_broadcast","sha":"a6e2c57019f93963ca5b4ba7607d68884ebd7c27","user":{"login":"lianhuiwang","id":545478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTQ3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang","html_url":"https://github.com/lianhuiwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20906966,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDkwNjk2Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"lianhuiwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lianhuiwang","id":545478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTQ3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang","html_url":"https://github.com/lianhuiwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lianhuiwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe base class `SpecificParquetRecordReaderBase` used for vectorized parquet reader will try to get pushed-down filters from the given configuration. This pushed-down filters are used for RowGroups-level filtering. However, we don't set up the filters to push down into the configuration. In other words, the filters are not actually pushed down to do RowGroups-level filtering. This patch is to fix this and tries to set up the filters for pushing down to configuration for the reader.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should be

this case, the result type of the expression becomes DECIMAL(38, 36) as we promote the individual string literals to DECIMAL(38, 18) when we handle string promotions for `BinaryArthmaticExpression`.\n\nI think we need to cast the string literals to Double type instead. I looked at the history and found that  this was changed to use decimal instead of double to avoid potential loss of precision when we cast decimal to double. \n\nTo double check i ran the query against hive, mysql. This query returns non NULL result for both the databases and both promote the expression to use double.\nHere is the output.\n- Hive\n\n``` SQL\nhive> create table l2 as select (cast(99 as decimal(19,6)) + '2') from l1;\nOK\nhive> describe l2;\nOK\n_c0                     double \n```\n- MySQL\n\n``` SQL\nmysql> create table foo2 as select (cast(99 as decimal(19,6)) + '2') from test;\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)\nRecords: 1  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0\n\nmysql> describe foo2;\n+-----------------------------------+--------+------+-----+---------+-------+\n| Field

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch reduces the verbosity of aggregate expressions in explain (but does not actually remove any information). As an example, for the following command:\n\n```\nspark.range(10).selectExpr(\"sum(id) + 1\", \"count(distinct id)\").explain(true)\n```\n\nOutput before this patch:\n\n```\n== Physical Plan ==\n*TungstenAggregate(key=[], functions=[(sum(id#0L),mode=Final,isDistinct=false),(count(id#0L),mode=Final,isDistinct=true)], output=[(sum(id) + 1)#3L,count(DISTINCT id)#16L])\n+- Exchange SinglePartition, None\n   +- *TungstenAggregate(key=[], functions=[(sum(id#0L),mode=PartialMerge,isDistinct=false),(count(id#0L),mode=Partial,isDistinct=true)], output=[sum#18L,count#21L])\n      +- *TungstenAggregate(key=[id#0L], functions=[(sum(id#0L),mode=PartialMerge,isDistinct=false)], output=[id#0L,sum#18L])\n         +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#0L, 5), None\n            +- *TungstenAggregate(key=[id#0L], functions=[(sum(id#0L),mode=Partial,isDistinct=false)], output=[id#0L,sum#18L])\n               +- *Range (0, 10, splits=2)\n```\n\nOutput after this patch:\n\n```\n== Physical Plan ==\n*TungstenAggregate(key=[], functions=[sum(id#0L),count(distinct id#0L)], output=[(sum(id) + 1)#3L,count(DISTINCT id)#16L])\n+- Exchange SinglePartition, None\n   +- *TungstenAggregate(key=[], functions=[merge_sum(id#0L),partial_count(distinct id#0L)], output=[sum#18L,count#21L])\n      +- *TungstenAggregate(key=[id#0L], functions=[merge_sum(id#0L)], output=[id#0L,sum#18L])\n         +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#0L, 5), None\n            +- *TungstenAggregate(key=[id#0L], functions=[partial_sum(id#0L)], output=[id#0L,sum#18L])\n               +- *Range (0, 10, splits=2)\n```\n\nNote the change from `(sum(id#0L),mode=PartialMerge,isDistinct=false)` to `merge_sum(id#0L)`.\n\nIn general aggregate explain is still very verbose, but further work will be done as follow-up pull requests. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually.\n","created_at":"2016-05-27T22:40:48Z","updated_at":"2016-05-28T21:16:19Z","closed_at":"2016-05-28T21:16:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e92a2b57401cbb4567dfa53ee7e2abf8f0ad48a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/88f84608628332cf4dd04e281875483743d7adbe","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-15636","ref":"SPARK-15636","sha":"88f84608628332cf4dd04e281875483743d7adbe","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAt https://github.com/aunkrig/janino/blob/janino_2.7.8/janino/src/org/codehaus/janino/ClassLoaderIClassLoader.java#L80-L85, Janino's classloader throws the exception when its parent throws a ClassNotFoundException with a cause set. However, it does not throw the exception when there is no cause set. Seems we need to use a special ClassLoader to wrap the actual parent classloader set to Janino handle this behavior.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI have reverted the workaround made by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11636 ( https://github.com/apache/spark/compare/master...yhuai:SPARK-15622?expand=1#diff-bb538fda94224dd0af01d0fd7e1b4ea0R81) and `test-only *ReplSuite --

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a simple patch that makes package names for Java 8 test suites consistent. I moved everything to test.org.apache.spark to we can test package private APIs properly. Also added \"java8\" as the package name so we can easily run all the tests related to Java 8.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis is a test only

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`EmbedSerializerInFilter` implicitly assumes that the plan fragment being optimized doesn't change plan schema, which is reasonable because `Dataset.filter` should never change the schema.\n\nHowever, due to another issue involving `DeserializeToObject` and `SerializeFromObject`, typed filter _does_ change plan schema (see [SPARK-15632](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15632)). This breaks `EmbedSerializerInFilter` and causes corrupted data.\n\nThis PR disables `EmbedSerializerInFilter` when there's a schema change to avoid data corruption. The schema change issue should be addressed in follow-up PRs.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew test case added in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI found that Spark does not have TeradataDialect.I want to add the TeradataDialect.scala to support Teradata database better.\nI override three functions in  TeradataDialect.scala:\n1.The url: jdbc:teradata\n2.The JDBCType:Teradata database does not support \"TEXT\",so we replace it with \"VARCHAR(255)\".Also we replace \"BLOB\" with \"VARBYTE(4)\".\n3.Teradata database does not support sql like \"LIMIT 1\",so we replace it with \"TOP 1\".\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n(Please explain how this patch was tested. E.g. unit tests, integration tests, manual tests)\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, Spark raises exceptions only when decimal `scale` > `precision`. However, the value becames `null` if `scale` = `precision`. We should raise exceptions for that case, too.\n\n**Before**\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"select cast('1' as Decimal(2,1))\")\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(2,1)): decimal(2,1)]\n\nscala> sql(\"select cast('1' as Decimal(2,2))\")\nres1: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [CAST(1 AS DECIMAL(2,2)): decimal(2,2)]\n\nscala> sql(\"select cast('1' as Decimal(2,3))\")\norg.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException:\nDecimal scale (3) cannot be greater than precision (2).\n\nscala> sql(\"select cast('1' as Decimal(2,1))\").head\nres2: org.apache.spark.sql.Row = [1.0]\n\nscala> sql(\"select cast('1' as Decimal(2,2))\").head\nres3: org.apache.spark.sql.Row = [null]\n```\n\n**After**\n\n``` scala\nscala> sql(\"select cast('1' as

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSee [SPARK-15605](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15605) for the detail of this bug. This PR fix 2 major bugs in this example:\n- The java example class use Param `maxIter`, it will fail when calling `Param.shouldOwn`. We need add a public method which return the `maxIter` Object. Because `Params.params` use java reflection to list all public method whose return type is `Param`, and invoke them to get all defined param objects in the instance.\n- The `uid` member defined in Java class will be initialized after Scala traits such as `HasFeaturesCol`. So when `HasFeaturesCol` being constructed, they get `uid` with null, which will cause `Param.shouldOwn` check fail.\n\nso, here is my changes:\n- Add public method:\n  `public IntParam getMaxIterParam() {return maxIter;}`\n- Use Java anonymous class overriding `uid()` to defined the `uid`, and it solve the second problem described above.\n- To make the `getMaxIterParam` can be invoked using java reflection, we must make the two class (MyJavaLogisticRegression and MyJavaLogisticRegressionModel) public. so I make them become inner public static class.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nOffline tests.\n","created_at":"2016-05-27T08:10:58Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T02:31:31Z","closed_at":"2016-06-02T16:12:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e28c112aaf35fe6ad93efa71f015872d468e161f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13353/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13353/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13353/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b6e5f2868e3d13f27a1c21235a304f36b3a5d81c","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-15605","ref":"spark-15605","sha":"b6e5f2868e3d13f27a1c21235a304f36b3a5d81c","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

The class allocated 4x space than needed as it was using `Int` to store the `Byte` values\n2. If CircularBuffer isn't full, currently toString() will print some garbage chars along with the content written as is tries to print the entire array allocated for the buffer. The fix is to keep track of buffer getting full and don't print the tail of the buffer if it isn't full (suggestion by @sameeragarwal over https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12194#discussion_r64495331)\n3.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\norg.apache.spark.sql.expressions.Aggregator currently requires defining the zero value for an aggregator. This is actually a limitation making it difficult to implement APIs such as reduce. In reduce (or reduceByKey), a single associative and commutative reduce function is specified by the user, and there is no definition of zero value.\nA small tweak to the API is to change zero to init, taking an input, similar to the following:\n\n``` scala\nabstract class Aggregator[-IN, BUF, OUT] extends Serializable {\n  def init(a: IN): BUF\n  def reduce(b: BUF, a: IN): BUF\n  def merge(b1: BUF, b2: BUF): BUF\n  def finish(reduction: BUF): OUT\n}\n```\n\nThen reduce can be implemented using:\n`f: (T, T) => T`\n\n``` scala\nnew Aggregator[T, T, T] {\n  override def init(a: T): T = identify\n  override def reduce(b: T, a: T): T = f(b, a)\n  override def merge(b1: T, b2: T): T = f(b1, b2)\n  override def finish(reduction: T): T = identify\n}\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis changes the behavior of --num-executors and spark.executor.instances when using dynamic allocation. Instead of turning dynamic allocation off, it uses the value for the initial number of executors.\n\nThis changes was discussed on [SPARK-13723](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-13723). I highly recommend using it while we can change the behavior for 2.0.0. In practice, the 1.x behavior causes unexpected behavior for users (it is not clear that it disables dynamic allocation) and wastes cluster resources because users rarely notice the log message.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch updates tests and adds a test for Utils.getDynamicAllocationInitialExecutors.\n","created_at":"2016-05-26T22:43:57Z","updated_at":"2016-06-23T19:47:39Z","closed_at":"2016-06-23T19:05:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26552e27185abc78228f23f40dc4cc6890df47d9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0352883dba5aef4fd56d6aaddba129071b1d22ea","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-13723-num-executors-with-dynamic-allocation","ref":"SPARK-13723-num-executors-with-dynamic-allocation","sha":"0352883dba5aef4fd56d6aaddba129071b1d22ea","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes a few integer overflows in `UnsafeSortDataFormat.copyRange()` and `ShuffleSortDataFormat copyRange()` that seems to be the most likely cause behind a number of `TimSort` contract violation errors seen in Spark 2.0 and Spark 1.6 while sorting large datasets.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a test in `ExternalSorterSuite` that instantiates a large array of the form of [150000000, 150000001, 150000002, ...., 300000000, 0, 1, 2, ..., 149999999] that triggers a `copyRange` in `TimSort.mergeLo` or `TimSort.mergeHi`. Note that the input dataset should contain at least 268.43 million rows with a certain data distribution for an overflow to occur.\n","created_at":"2016-05-26T20:48:57Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T02:25:51Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T22:51:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"425adce0b4e2dff76f5940422003eefd4d9bb56f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f722e44917fd46d5ecb722e72b82e60fed24fa27","head":{"label":"sameeragarwal:timsort-bug","ref":"timsort-bug","sha":"f722e44917fd46d5ecb722e72b82e60fed24fa27","user":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20599564,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU5OTU2NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"sameeragarwal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sameeragarwal","id":166454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NjQ1NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/166454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal","html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sameeragarwal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sameeragarwal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nProfiling a Spark job spilling large amount of intermediate data we found that significant portion of time is being spent in DiskObjectWriter.updateBytesWritten function. Looking at the code, we see that the function is being called too frequently to update the number of bytes written to disk. We should reduce the frequency to avoid this.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by running the job on cluster and saw 20% CPU gain  by this change.\n","created_at":"2016-05-26T18:55:47Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T18:24:29Z","closed_at":"2016-05-27T18:24:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"134d31d947ad830b82915e9509eb964d0cc00e23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5169e36823425413a072c483d650e9f6500929e9","head":{"label":"sitalkedia:DiskObjectWriter","ref":"DiskObjectWriter","sha":"5169e36823425413a072c483d650e9f6500929e9","user":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51496876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQ5Njg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"sitalkedia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR addresses two related issues:\n1. `Dataset.showString()` should show case classes/Java beans at all levels as rows, while master code only handles top level ones.\n2. `Dataset.showString()` should show full contents produced the underlying query plan\n   \n   Dataset is only a view of the underlying query plan. Columns not referred by the encoder are still reachable using methods like `Dataset.col`. So it probably makes more sense to show full contents of the query plan.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTwo new test cases are added in `DatasetSuite` to check `.showString()` output.\n","created_at":"2016-05-26T18:03:27Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T23:05:03Z","closed_at":"2016-05-26T23:25:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d787a7aa8920903f7a4c76f70ffa3d9a4cd59b68","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/13331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/13331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d688034b24e5250271556d7ff2ee4cdc91862740","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-15550-ds-show","ref":"spark-15550-ds-show","sha":"d688034b24e5250271556d7ff2ee4cdc91862740","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror
