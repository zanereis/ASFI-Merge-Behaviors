But due to [refactoring](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5208), we made minor tweaks to hfile scanner apis. Apparently, it could cause a latency hit w/ on-demand lookup when compared to full scan. The issue is, we switched [reseekTo](https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/da171c341eab8adebab756743243d94477a9074f/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/io/hfile/HFileScanner.java#L66)(Key) to [seekTo](https://github.com/apache/hbase/blob/da171c341eab8adebab756743243d94477a9074f/hbase-server/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hbase/io/hfile/HFileScanner.java#L51)(Key). Difference between seekTo() and reseekTo() is, both of them moves the cursor to the key of interest, but at the end of the call, seekTo() will rewind the cursor to the beginning of data block in Hfile, while reseekTo will leave the cursor at the same position. \r\nRef from HfileScanner docs:\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * SeekTo or just before the passed <code>cell</code>.  Examine the return\r\n   * code to figure whether we found the cell or not.\r\n   * Consider the cell stream of all the cells in the file,\r\n   * <code>c[0] .. c[n]</code>, where there are n cells in the file.\r\n   * @param cell\r\n   * @return -1, if cell &lt; c[0], no position;\r\n   * 0, such that c[i] = cell and scanner is left in position i; and\r\n   * 1, such that c[i] &lt; cell, and scanner is left in position i.\r\n   * The scanner will position itself between c[i] and c[i+1] where\r\n   * c[i] &lt; cell &lt;= c[i+1].\r\n   * If there is no cell c[i+1] greater than or equal to the input cell, then the\r\n   * scanner will position itself at the end of the file and next() will return\r\n   * false when it is called.\r\n   * @throws IOException\r\n   */\r\n  int seekTo(Cell cell) throws IOException;\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Reseek to or just before the passed <code>cell</code>. Similar to seekTo\r\n   * except that this can be called even if the scanner is not at the beginning\r\n   * of a file.\r\n   * This can be used to seek only to cells which come after the current position\r\n   * of the scanner.\r\n   * Consider the cell stream of all the cells in the file,\r\n   * <code>c[0] .. c[n]</code>, where there are n cellc in the file after\r\n   * current position of HFileScanner.\r\n   * The scanner will position itself between c[i] and c[i+1] where\r\n   * c[i] &lt; cell &lt;= c[i+1].\r\n   * If there is no cell c[i+1] greater than or equal to the input cell, then the\r\n   * scanner will position itself at the end of the file and next() will return\r\n   * false when it is called.\r\n   * @param cell Cell to find (should be non-null)\r\n   * @return -1, if cell &lt; c[0], no position;\r\n   * 0, such that c[i] = cell and scanner is left in position i; and\r\n   * 1, such that c[i] &lt; cell, and scanner is left in position i.\r\n   * @throws IOException\r\n   */\r\n  int reseekTo(Cell cell) throws IOException;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe sort all the keys before any on-demand look up to ensure we would not need to go back in position once the search for a given key. Bcoz, next key is going to be lexicographically greater than the current key being searched. \r\n\r\nThis patch fixes it back to reseekTo(Key). \r\nAlso, found another bug where in we missed to sort keys to look up in base files in HoodieBackedTableMetadata in [recent patch for RecordLevelIndex](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/8758/files#r1230256239). Fixed the sorting towards this. Also, removed sorting from HfileData blocks, since now we have repeated sorting. So, the fix is to sort once per file Slice within lookupKeysFromFileSlice, so that individual look ups (base file, each log files) does not need to sort. \r\n\r\nFixed argument names and variable names in downstream consumers to avoid ambiguity on whether they keys are sorted or not. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis should improve the on-demand lookup with Hfile by a large factor. From our micro-benchmarking, we found latency improvement from 10s of seconds to 100 to 200ms(when 1000s are keys are looked up in a Hfile containing 100k entries). \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none,

Change Logs\r\nDuring spark stage retries, spark driver may have all the information to reconcile the commit and proceed with next steps, while a stray executor may still be writing to a data file and complete later (beyond reconcile step, before the JVM exit).\r\n\r\nExtra files left on the dataset, excluded from reconcile commit step could show up as data quality issue for query engines with duplicate records (without use of metadata table)\r\n\r\nThis change brings completion markers which tries to prevent the dataset from experiencing data quality issues, in such corner case scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis change, would prevent the second/subsequent tasks/executors from creating additional files (with a different write token) and reuse the write status of successfully completed data files, by storing the serialized write status in the completion marker file (Available only with Direct Markers, but can be extended to timeline server based markers as well).  During the second and subsequent attempts, write status stored in the completion marker is returned so that the same data file created by the first attempt can be reused.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nImproved reliability, data quality due to infrastructure related failures, resulting in stage/task retries.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\nLow/Medium:  This change has been in production for about a year now at Uber.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\nENFORCE_COMPLETION_MARKER_CHECKS - Allows configuring whether to fail the job or continue with retries, when an already completed file is being retried.   With a planned change, this would allow the second/subsequent attempt to create a file to succeed using the previously created copy of data.\r\n\r\nENFORCE_FINALIZE_WRITE_CHECK - Allows configuring whether to fail the job if commit reconciliation step has been completed and the write stage is retried (say a block from writeStatus RDD is found to be lost, when iterating over write statues for record index update).   Single executor writing to multiple files (data spilling over to more than one file) and stage failure post reconciliation results in data quality issues.  This flag is helpful in failing the job, instead of creating incorrect commit.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis pr is the first subtask of [HUDI-4373](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4373).\r\nIt focuses on 2 things:\r\n1. Refactor the code of consistent hashing bucket index, extract common utility to client common module\r\n2. Flink write progress support consistent hashing bucket index.\r\nThe solution is to introduce a bucket assigner operator, which to decide the the location of the incoming record based on the consistent bucket index metadata. If it finds a new partition, it send a request to the coordinator to create the partition metadata. It could avoid multiple subtasks are trying to initialize metadata for the same partition. \r\nThen, the result data stream would be shuffle by `fileid`, finally the data stream would be passed to downstream write tasks.\r\n\r\nIt would not cover (would be done in the following subtasks):\r\n1. generate resize plan\r\n2. resolve the case which the resize happen during the write process \r\n\r\n\r\nps:  This work is follow up of [pr6737](https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6737). Thanks for contribution @YuweiXiao \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nAll documents update would be introduced in the final subtask of [HUDI-4373](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-4373).\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPass in Spark Engine Context Wrapper for DeltaSync instead of spark engine context. This ensures more flexibility and configuration of the spark context by the Deltastreamer when calling DeltaSync\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe current constructor of DeltaSync takes in the JavaSparkContext directly as argument. Instead, pass in the Hudi wrapper class HudiSparkEngineContext for more flexibility. Ensured backward compatibility for DeltaSync.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis change fixes the transitions from requested to inflight, requested to complete, requested to rollback and inflight to rollback in IncrementalTimelineSyncFileSystemView\r\n\r\nThere are some cases, where incremental file sync breaks. Especially if there are rollbacks on replacecommits or logcompaction commits. \r\nFor example, if current writer saw pending replacecommit or logcompaction commit, and other writers rollbacked those commits, now if the current writer tries to incrementally sync those rollback commits it would cause failure.\r\n\r\nApart from the above change, there is also no standard way of passing timeline object to various file system views. In some places caller's are passing completedAndCompactionTimeline and in some cases active timeline is passed. This change is trying to bring some standardizing around this. Main idea is always pass active timeline and the views themselves will figure out how to construct file groups and sync instants and then caller can use various APIs to fetch completed or inflight views.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo public facing API but the impact is medium\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nHigh\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nAll the required documentation is provided within the code.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis change implements a new clustering strategy to execute parquet tools commands for rewriting use cases.\r\nIf there is a use case of pruning some columns to save storage memory, current approach of clustering will iterate over every record and remove the unused column, this is so much time consuming. By directly using ParquetTools we can achieve this by running a command within the clustering strategy.\r\nHere, the logic goes through the process of creating marker files, so that on any event of failure it could rely on rollback's MarkerBasedRollbackStrategy to remove the inflight files and parquet files.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNo impact addition of a new feature.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the pre-commit validatorsbased on Spark SQL (`SqlQueryInequalityPreCommitValidator` and `SqlQueryEqualityPreCommitValidator`).  Before this PR, for the before state in the validation, the `getRecordsFromCommittedFiles` returns an empty data frame without a schema, causing SQL with column name reference to fail (see the stacktrace below).  This PR fixes the issue by either using the table schema if present, or the schema from after state, if the table is empty.\r\n```\r\nCaused by: java.util.concurrent.CompletionException: org.apache.spark.sql.AnalysisException: cannot resolve 'driver' given input columns: []; line 1 pos 49;\r\n'Aggregate [unresolvedalias(count(1), None)]\r\n+- 'Filter isnull('driver)\r\n   +- SubqueryAlias staged_table_1_before\r\n      +- View (`staged_table_1_before`, [])\r\n         +- LocalRelation <empty>\r\n```\r\nA new set of tests are added in `TestCOWDataSourceStorage#testPreCommitValidationWithSQLQueryEqualityInequality`.

Change Logs\r\n\r\n#7561 introduced a bug where in a case, the partition changes may be missed in the meta sync, e.g., the following active timeline:\r\n\r\n```\r\nts3.rollback, ts50.commit, ts51.commit, ts52.commit, ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nand ts49.commit and ts48.commit are archived.\r\n\r\nIf ts47 is the last sync commit time, and ts48.commit or ts49.commit has partition changes, meta sync misses such changes.\r\n\r\nThis above issue is solved by a separate PR #8388 where the hive sync client returns the right timeline which gives write commits only for checking.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure the problematic API implementation (`TimelineUtils.getCommitsTimelineAfter`) is still fixed.\r\n\r\nExisting tests are enhanced:\r\n- `TestTimelineUtils.testGetCommitsTimelineAfter`: this test fails before this PR and passes after the PR.\r\n- `TestHiveSyncTool. testBasicSync`: this test passes before and after this PR on master.  Note that, without #8388, this test would fail without this PR.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFixes a bug.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nWe need to update release notes on the regression.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-15T21:57:35Z","updated_at":"2023-06-16T20:21:12Z","closed_at":"2023-06-16T20:21:11Z","merged_at":"2023-06-16T20:21:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"db741da47ba455504dec0ec6768f1fdfbe01a848","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2228366714,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjI4MzY2NzE0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/meta-sync","name":"meta-sync","color":"87C7C5","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe jira aims to add a new API for fetching transformed schema in the Transformer. It adds the following API.\r\n```\r\nStructType transformedSchema(JavaSparkContext jsc, SparkSession sparkSession, StructType incomingStruct, TypedProperties properties\r\n```\r\nwhich returns StructType. The StructType represents the schema of the dataset after transformation is complete. The API has a default implementation provided.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR improves archival to automatically adjust the archival configs (`hoodie.keep.min.commits` and `hoodie.keep.max.commits`) based on the cleaning configs, working for both \"KEEP_LATEST_BY_HOURS\", \"KEEP_LATEST_COMMITS\" cleaning policy, if archival is configured to be more aggressive than the cleaning.  Before this change, an error is thrown and the user has to manually fix the configurations.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nImproves the user experience of archival and cleaning.\r\n\r\n### Risk

Change Logs\r\n\r\nOne can create his own implementation of instant management by inheriting `HoodieActiveTimeline`, just like `HoodieMetaserverBasedTimeline` in RFC-36. Therefore, the operations of instants like creation , deletion, and existence \r\n should be managed uniformly through `HoodieActiveTimeline`.\r\n\r\nSo in this PR:\r\n- Unified instant management. Instant cannot be created/deleted directly from the file system(**this breaks RFC-36**), it's better to use the interface in `HoodieActiveTimeline`. (In fact, I wonder how can RFC-36 run successfully without this change)\r\n- **Since instant can't just be a file in FS (in RFC-36, it's a record in database)**, change the interfaces' name to make them more universal:\r\n  - deleteInstant\r\n  - instantExists\r\n  - createInstant\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, I will also modify some test cases so that they all use the above interface.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAs above\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnone\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIncremental Clean ignore partitions affected by append write commits/delta commits. In append write, we may write thousands of files in different partitions in one commit, and we know that we don't need to clean them at all.  However current incremental clean will try to list the partitions anyway. This pr fix this and we won't list those partitions affected by append write commits. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nDo not fetch commit metadata and list partition for append writes ( we will still list replace commits) \r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nTo query Hudi table from bigquery, the current BigQuerySyncTool creates two bigquery external tables, one over the data files and the other over a manifest file that contains the data file name. Based on these two tables, it creates a View to reflect the latest version of data using the following query: `SELECT * FROM data_table WHERE _hoodie_file_name IN ( SELECT filename FROM manifest_file_table)`.\r\n\r\nThe direct reason for such a workaround is that bigquery cannot support manifest file. However, bigquery is rolling out its [manifest file support](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/information-schema-table-options#options_table) now. This feature allows users to use manifest files rather than data files as source URIs. Right now the roll-out seems to cover non-partitioned external tables (using hive partition would return an error `not supported for hive partition`), which should be covering partitioned external tables soon.\r\n\r\nGiven this new bigquery feature, it would be better to update BigQuerySyncTool correspondingly:\r\n\r\n1. Allow creating a bigquery compatible manifest file which expects absolute path of data files. This has been done in [HUDI-6254](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-6254).\r\n2. Allow using the new manifest file to create external table directly. Users can set the option `hoodie.gcp.bigquery.sync.use_bq_manifest_file` introduced in this PR to control whether to use the bq manifest file feature. When this options is true, BigQuerySyncTool will create a manifest file with absolute path and issue a `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE ... OPTIONS (uris=[MANIFEST_FILE_URI], format=\"PARQUET\", file_set_spec_type=\"NEW_LINE_DELIMITED_MANIFEST\", ...)` query to bigquery.\r\n3. Avoid breaking existing user workflows.  In case there are some users relying on the view-based workaround, it probably make sense to keep the workaround alive at least for now. That would require maintaining two versions of manifest files.\r\n4. Provide a temporary workaround for using bigquery manifest file support till this feature extends to partitioned table. The partition columns will not be recognized by creating a hive-partitioned external table. A non-partitioned external table will only have columns from the parquet data files. To keep the partition columns, a workaround is to set the `hoodie.datasource.write.drop.partition.columns` as false and allow users to not specify the `hoodie.gcp.bigquery.sync.source_uri_prefix`, such that the partition columns can be written into the parquet files and the BigQuerySyncTool will  create a non-partitioned external table. Query this external table will produce the same results as  querying the aforementioned View.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nA more efficient way to query Hudi table from bigquery.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nNone. The existing view-based approach will still work.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the support of Apache Hudi on Spark 3.4.0.\r\n\r\nThere are a few changes in Spark 3.4.0 that the Hudi Spark integration needs to adjust to, particularly:\r\n- `SQLConf.PARQUET_INFER_TIMESTAMP_NTZ_ENABLED` (`spark.sql.parquet.inferTimestampNTZ.enabled`) is required for parquet reading\r\n- case class changes of `MergeIntoTable` (five to six arguments)\r\n```\r\nBefore Spark 3.4.0 (five arguments):\r\n case class MergeIntoTable(\r\n    targetTable: LogicalPlan,\r\n    sourceTable: LogicalPlan,\r\n    mergeCondition: Expression,\r\n    matchedActions: Seq[MergeAction],\r\n    notMatchedActions: Seq[MergeAction]) extends BinaryCommand with SupportsSubquery\r\n   \r\nSince Spark 3.4.0 (six arguments):\r\n case class MergeIntoTable(\r\n    targetTable: LogicalPlan,\r\n    sourceTable: LogicalPlan,\r\n    mergeCondition: Expression,\r\n    matchedActions: Seq[MergeAction],\r\n    notMatchedActions: Seq[MergeAction],\r\n    notMatchedBySourceActions: Seq[MergeAction]) extends BinaryCommand with SupportsSubquery\r\n```\r\n- API change of `SchemaUtils.checkColumnNameDuplication`\r\n- `PartitionedFile` change\r\n```\r\nBefore Spark 3.4.0,\r\ncase class PartitionedFile(\r\n  partitionValues: InternalRow,\r\n  filePath: String,\r\n  start: Long,\r\n  @transient locations: Array[String] = Array.empty)\r\n\r\nSince Spark 3.4.0, the filePath is switch to [[SparkPath]] for type safety:\r\ncase class PartitionedFile(\r\n  partitionValues: InternalRow,\r\n  filePath: SparkPath,\r\n  start: Long,\r\n  length: Long,\r\n  @transient locations: Array[String] = Array.empty,\r\n  modificationTime: Long = 0L,\r\n  fileSize: Long = 0L)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo support Apache Hudi on Spark 3.4.0, here the changes made:\r\n- Adds adapter support for Spark 3.4 in `SparkAdapterSupport` and `HoodieSparkUtils`.\r\n- Adds adapter framework changes and Hudi-related logic adjustment:\r\n  - To account for the config `SQLConf.PARQUET_INFER_TIMESTAMP_NTZ_ENABLED` (`spark.sql.parquet.inferTimestampNTZ.enabled`) required for parquet reading in Spark 3.4.0, the config is set now in `HoodieSparkFileReaderFactory`.\r\n  - To account for case class changes of `MergeIntoTable` (five to six arguments), a new function `def unapplyMergeIntoTable(plan: LogicalPlan): Option[(LogicalPlan, LogicalPlan, Expression)] in `HoodieCatalystPlansUtils` and corresponding implementation in each Spark version are added in the Spark adapter framework.\r\n  - To account for the API change of `SchemaUtils.checkColumnNameDuplication`, `HoodieSchemaUtils` and `checkColumnNameDuplication` function and corresponding implementation in each Spark version are added to the Spark adapter framework.\r\n  - To account for `PartitionedFile` change where the filePath is switch to [[SparkPath]] for type safety, the `HoodieSparkPartitionedFileUtils` and corresponding implementation in each Spark version are added to the Spark adapter framework.\r\n  - Creates `BASE_PATH_PARAM = \"basePath\"` as Spark 3.4.0 uses `FileIndexOptions.BASE_PATH_PARAM` instead `PartitioningAwareFileIndex.BASE_PATH_PARAM`\r\n  - Uses the above adapter functions to adjust logic in `BaseFileOnlyRelation`, `HoodieBaseRelation`, `HoodieBootstrapRelation`, `HoodieDataSourceHelper`, `Iterators`, `MergeOnReadSnapshotRelation`, `HoodieCDCRDD`, `AlterHoodieTableAddColumnsCommand`, and `HoodieAnalysis`.\r\n- Spark 3.4 now supports vectorized reader on nested fields.  However, Hudi does not support this yet due to custom schema evolution logic.  So we add logic to override `supportBatch` in `HoodieParquetFileFormat` for Spark 3.4.\r\n- Uses `ColumnVector` instead of `WritableColumnVector` to get general in `Spark32PlusHoodieVectorizedParquetRecordReader`\r\n- Adds `hudi-spark3.4.x` module by mainly copying the code from `hudi-spark3.3.x` module and making following adjustments (more details below on the code comparison):\r\n  - `Spark32PlusHoodieParquetFileFormat` is removed.  Each spark version module has its own file format class.  `Spark34HoodieParquetFileFormat` adds custom logic on when to enable vectorized reader based on various conditions, compared to `Spark33HoodieParquetFileFormat`.\r\n  - `HoodieSpark34PartitionedFileUtils` is different from `HoodieSpark33PartitionedFileUtils ` because of `PartitionedFile` changes\r\n  - `Spark34ResolveHudiAlterTableCommand` adjusts logic based on `AlterColumn` class changes.\r\n  - `HoodieSpark3_4ExtendedSqlAstBuilder` adjusts logic based on Spark 3.4.\r\n  - `HoodieSpark34CatalystExpressionUtils` adjusts logic based on `ParseToTimestamp` change and removal of `AnsiCast` compared to `HoodieSpark33CatalystExpressionUtils`.\r\n  - `HoodieSpark34CatalystPlanUtils` adjusts logic based on `MergeIntoTable` change.\r\n  - `HoodieSpark34SchemaUtils` is different from `HoodieSpark33SchemaUtils` because of API change of `SchemaUtils.checkColumnNameDuplication`\r\n- Adds Github Actions to run Spark tests and bundle validation on Spark 3.4.0.\r\n- Adjusts tests due to changes in Spark 3.4.0.\r\n  - TestHoodieRecordSerialization: expected record size has changed.\r\n  - Error messages for Spark SQL have changed in a few tests in `TestInsertTable`, `TestMergeIntoTable`, `TestIndexSyntax` (`table.identifier.quotedString` now also has catalog name as the prefix), `TestCopyToTempViewProcedure`.  New error messages in Spark SQL are presented in https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/error/error-classes.json.\r\n\r\nThis PR address all compatibility issues in Hudi Spark integration across Spark versions on top of the #8826, which adds support of Hudi for Spark 3.4.0 on Hudi 0.13.1 release only.  @mansipp, @rahil-c, @CTTY, and @umehrot2 have significantly contributed to #8826 to make Hudi 0.13.1 release work on Spark 3.4.0 for EMR release.  This PR makes sure all recent changes in Hudi Spark integration since Hudi 0.13.1 are considered and taken care of, including:\r\n- #7871\r\n- #8714 \r\n- #8764 \r\n- #8280\r\n- #8445\r\n- #8708 \r\n\r\n#### More details\r\n\r\nMajor changes from `hudi-spark3.3.x` to `hudi-spark3.4.x` module:\r\n`Spark33HoodieParquetFileFormat` vs `Spark34HoodieParquetFileFormat`:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1919\"

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAt present, the default value of `read.streaming.skip_clustering` is false, which could cause the situation that streaming reading reads the replaced file slices of clustering, so that streaming reading may read T-1 day data when clustering the data of T-1 day to cause duplicated data and could not restore from checkpoint. Therefore streaming read should skip clustering instants for all cases to avoid reading the replaced file slices.
