cleanTest was getting various errors from Go due to the Go module caches inside /.gogradle directories being read-only, so clean was unable to delete them. I adjusted this with the following:\r\n\r\n1. Add -modcacherw to GOFLAGS on any commonly used gogradle tasks.\r\n2. Avoid using gofmt on nested Gradle modules, as it would try to format the contents of /.gogradle.\r\n\r\nSidenote: The boot.go change is a result of running gofmt. It seemed appropriate to leave it in.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

is towards a migration to save 3-5% of CPU for small bundles by effectively merging the QueueingBeamFnDataClient at a higher level within the inbound observer removing some unnecessary timed polling/take calls. The existing implementation relied on the timeouts to prevent a stuckness issue since they were not able to propagate the cancellation cleanly to the producer or consumer.\r\n\r\nJMH benchmarks based upon the complete change:\r\n```\r\nResult \"org.apache.beam.fn.harness.ProcessBundleBenchmark.testTinyBundle\":\r\n  55980.588 ±(99.9%) 1410.852 ops/s [Average]\r\n  (min, avg, max) = (51231.160, 55980.588, 59024.162), stdev = 1883.447\r\n  CI (99.9%): [54569.736, 57391.440] (assumes normal distribution)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBenchmark before the complete change:\r\n```\r\nResult \"org.apache.beam.fn.harness.ProcessBundleBenchmark.testTinyBundle\":\r\n  54228.952 ±(99.9%) 1415.909 ops/s [Average]\r\n  (min, avg, max) = (47791.452, 54228.952, 57266.584), stdev = 1890.198\r\n  CI (99.9%): [52813.043, 55644.862] (assumes normal distribution)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso note that I'm breaking this change up across multiple PRs since the end goal is to deprecate and replace `BeamFnDataGrpcMultiplexer` with `BeamFnDataGrpcMultiplexer2` and similarly for the inbound observer which is why the `2` in the name.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
