scripts/sparkDML.sh to remove some hard-coded parameters and fix a path of SystemML configuration in spark-submit command-line options.\n\nThe sparkDML.sh overwrite $SPARK_HOME and $SYSTEMML_HOME by hard-coded parameters. If these environment variables is already defineded, using it without overwritting is helpful for users. And, some default parameters (eg. driver_memory, num_executors, ...) for spark-submit are hard-coded too. I think that these parameters setting in ($SPARK_HOME | $SPARK_CONF_DIR)/conf/spark-defaults.conf is better than hard-coded in the shell-script. This PR fixes these.\n\nIn addition, this PR change a path of SystemML-config.xml in spark-submit comand-line options. Because, SystemML-config.xml is placed under conf/
