Proposed changes\r\nFor #7433\r\nThis PR proposes to implement a V2 version of partition prune algorithm.  We use session variable `partition_prune_algorithm_version`  as the control flag, with a default value of 2.\r\n\r\n## Design notes\r\n### Introduce `ColumnRange` to represent all the predicates for a column. It's extension of the current `PartitionColumnFilter`.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of predicates for a column: `is null` predicate and other predicates that the value of a column is not null, e.g., `col=1`, `col>2`, `col in (1,2,3)`, etc.\r\nThis can represent both conjunctive and disjunctive predicates for a column.\r\nThe meaning of the predicates is: `conjunctiveIsNull` AND (`rangeSet` OR `disjunctiveIsNull`).\r\n\r\n### For single column partition, unify the logic for both list and range partition prune. \r\n1. Convert partition keys to `ColumnRange` for every partition, get a candidate RangeMap `candidate`. The key of the `candidate` is partitions' column range, and the value of the `candidate` range map is partition ID. \r\n2. Apply the `ColumnRange` of all the predicates to the `candidate` to prune partitions. \r\n\r\n### For multiple-column partition, list partition prune is improved and range partition prune is just like v1 version.\r\nFor **multiple-column list partitions**, it's a little different from the logic of single column partition.\r\nFirstly, we group partition ranges by the range of each column, to compare with the filters. \r\nThen we apply the ranges in predicates to prune partitions like what we do for the single-column partition. \r\n\r\nFor **multiple-column range partition**,  it's a little complex to unify the logic of pruning multiple columns partition with list range partitions.\r\n   \r\nThe key point is that the list partition's values are the explicit values of partition columns, however, the range-bound for a partition column in multiple columns partition is dependent on both other partition columns' range values and the range value itself:\r\n\r\nLet's say we have two partition columns k1, k2:\r\nFor partition [(1, 5), (1, 10)), the range for k2 is [5, 10).\r\nFor partition [(1, 5), (2, 10)), the range for k2 is (-∞, +∞).\r\nFor partition [(1, 10), (2, 5)), the range for k2 is (-∞, 5) union [10, +∞).\r\n \r\nWe could try to compute the range-bound of every column in multiple columns partition and unify the logic like pruning multiple list columns partition for multiple range ones in the future.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n   Add a config `repair_slow_replica`    \r\n    when this config is true, Doris will try to delete the replica\r\n    with the largest number of versions, and then rebalance the replica.\r\n    Usually, when the number of versions of a certain replica is much higher\r\n    than that of other replicas, there are some problems with the current be's compilation.\r\n    Migrating to other machines can typically solve this problem.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that

manually or accidentally. In any case, this poses a great threat to the stability of the cluster.\r\nTherefore, we need more precise SQL block methods. \r\n\r\nIt should :\r\n1. Just bolck query statement \r\n2. Let the explain statement execute\r\n3. Block large queries before being executed, but after being planned to get core information of OlapScanNode \r\n\r\nClose related #7202 (replace it with issue number if it exists).\r\n\r\nDescribe the overview of changes, and introduce why we need it.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [x] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #7202 ) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nClose related #7389\r\n\r\nSupport create Iceberg external table in Doris. \r\n\r\nThis is the first step to support Iceberg external table.\r\n\r\n### Create Iceberg external table\r\nThis pr describes two ways to create Iceberg external tables. Both ways do not require explicitly specifying column definitions, Doris automatically converts them based on Iceberg's column definitions.\r\n\r\n1. Create an Iceberg external table directly\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n    CREATE [EXTERNAL] TABLE table_name \r\n    ENGINE = ICEBERG\r\n    [COMMENT \"comment\"]\r\n    PROPERTIES (\r\n    \"iceberg.database\" = \"iceberg_db_name\",\r\n    \"iceberg.table\" = \"icberg_table_name\",\r\n    \"iceberg.hive.metastore.uris\"  =  \"thrift://192.168.0.1:9083\",\r\n    \"iceberg.catalog.type\"  =  \"HIVE_CATALOG\"\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create an Iceberg database and automatically create all the tables under that db.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n    CREATE DATABASE db_name \r\n    [COMMENT \"comment\"]\r\n    PROPERTIES (\r\n    \"iceberg.database\" = \"iceberg_db_name\",\r\n    \"iceberg.hive.metastore.uris\" = \"thrift://192.168.0.1:9083\",\r\n    \"iceberg.catalog.type\" = \"HIVE_CATALOG\"\r\n    );\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Show table creation\r\n\r\n1. For individual tables you can view them with `help show create table`.\r\n\r\n```sql \r\nmysql> show create table iceberg_db.logs_1;\r\n+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| Table  | Create Table                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\r\n+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| logs_1 | CREATE TABLE `logs_1` (\r\n  `level` varchar(-1) NOT NULL COMMENT \"null\",\r\n  `event_time` datetime NOT NULL COMMENT \"null\",\r\n  `message` varchar(-1) NOT NULL COMMENT \"null\"\r\n) ENGINE=ICEBERG\r\nCOMMENT \"ICEBERG\"\r\nPROPERTIES (\r\n\"iceberg.database\" = \"doris\",\r\n\"iceberg.table\" = \"logs_1\",\r\n\"iceberg.hive.metastore.uris\"  =  \"thrift://10.10.10.10:9087\",\r\n\"iceberg.catalog.type\"  =  \"HIVE_CATALOG\"\r\n) |\r\n+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. For Iceberg database, you can view it with `help show table creation`.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nmysql> show table creation from iceberg_db;\r\n+--------+---------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| Table  | Status  | Create Time         | Error Msg                                               |\r\n+--------+---------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n| logs   | fail    | 2021-12-14 13:50:10 | Cannot convert unknown type to Doris type: list<string> |\r\n| logs_1 | success | 2021-12-14 13:50:10 |                                                         |\r\n+--------+---------+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+\r\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\n  This is a new syntax.\r\n  \r\n  Show table creation records in Iceberg database:\r\n  \r\n  Syntax:\r\n  ```sql\r\n      SHOW TABLE CREATION [FROM db] [LIKE mask]\r\n  ```\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [x] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-14T06:03:33Z","updated_at":"2022-01-27T02:28:31Z","closed_at":"2022-01-27T02:22:47Z","merged_at":"2022-01-27T02:22:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"3b8d48f08b7c53abd236e41a16791c38a6aa847d","assignee":{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"morningman","id":2899462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4OTk0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2899462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman","html_url":"https://github.com/morningman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/morningman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1099563192,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDk5NTYzMTky","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/feature","name":"kind/feature","color":"c7def8","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Refactor the scheduling logic of broker load. Details see #7367 \r\n2. Fix bug that loadedBytes in SHOW LOAD result is wrong.\r\n3. Cancel the thread of LoadTimeoutChecker\r\n   Now for PENDING load jobs, there will be no timeout. And the timeout of a load job\r\n   start when pending load task is scheduled.\r\n4. Fix a bug that the loading task is never submitted to the pool.\r\n   The logic of BlockedPolicy is wrong. We should make sure the task is submitted to the pool,\r\n   or the RejectedExecutionException should be thrown.\r\n5. Now the transaction of a load job will begin in pending task, instead of when submitting the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR.

   This PR mainly prohibits operations such as aggregation/sorting/window functions\r\n    on lateral views containing subqueries.\r\n    For example:\r\n    select min(e1) from (select c1 from table group by c1)tmp1 lateral view explode_split(c1, \",\") tmp2 as e1\r\n    But the query can be written in another way, and the result is the same.\r\n    select min(e1) from (select e1 from (select c1 from table group by c1)tmp1 lateral view explode_split(c1, \",\") tmp2 as e1) tmp3\r\n\r\n    The reason is that when the results of a inline view are subjected to a lateral view,\r\n    and the outer query performs aggregation or sorting operations on non-table-function columns.\r\n    The output slot id of the table function node is empty or has fewer columns.\r\n\r\n    The essential reason is that when the inner layer contains an inline view,\r\n    the outer expression needs to be mapped to the correct tuple through the substitute method\r\n    according to the smap instead of the virtual tuple.\r\n    But the substitute method of slot ref cannot recurse to its own source exprs.\r\n\r\n    E.g\r\n    SlotRef: c2 <source expr min(c1)> from agg tuple\r\n    smap: <c1, c3>\r\n    before: c2 <source expr min(c1)>\r\n    after: c2 <source expr min(c1)> no changed\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nFix the problem that when the source column of the lateral view comes from a inline view,\r\nthe column in the inline view cannot be materialized correctly.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, fix the problem that the correct output column cannot be projected\r\nwhen the source column of the lateral view comes from a inline view.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that when the column in the query is from a inline view column.\r\nDuring semantic analysis and planning, it needs to be converted from tuple(virtual) to real tuple.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-06T12:40:51Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T02:23:34Z","closed_at":"2021-12-07T02:23:34Z","merged_at":"2021-12-07T02:23:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"2ae9c41aa1ef40b9f2c4d2984849b067484a546e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes

Proposed changes\r\n\r\ncode refactor: improve code's readability, avoid const_cast\r\n\r\n1. make loop simpler and clearer by using range-based loop grammar, it's safer than old loop style\r\n2. iteration for _row_desc.tuple_descriptors() use index replace index and iterator mixed\r\n3. add new function To cast_to(From from), use this union-based casting between two types to replace reinterpret_cast,  this new cast is more readable\r\n4. avoid using the same variable name for nested loop, it's dangerous\r\n5. add const keyword for member functions followed CppCoreGuidelines\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [x ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-06T06:58:52Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T14:36:37Z","closed_at":"2021-12-09T14:36:37Z","merged_at":"2021-12-09T14:36:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"80c11da3df0d4b599256c23c1965f94ee5747ca6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2039763841,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM5NzYzODQx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/approved","name":"approved","color":"00ff00","default":false,"description":"Indicates

My colleagues and I stepped on the pit when building the debugging environment, so I want to improve this chapter in combination with my own stepping on the pit experience.\r\n\r\nThe following is my explanation of the changes: \r\n\r\n1. mkdir -p ./thirdparty/installed/bin\r\nexplain: When I downloaded versions 0.14 and 0.15, there were no files under thirdparty, so I didn't know whether to create it myself or what to do. Finally, I decided to create it myself. I think it's necessary to add instructions here.\r\n\r\n2. Add installation thrift@0.13.0 Failed handling method. \r\nexplain: My colleagues and I failed to find the installation package when executing the installation command, and finally found a solution on GitHub. Therefore, I added the handling method of the problem to avoid other Mac users from getting stuck in this place.\r\n\r\n3. Fixed an error in the generated code description.\r\nexplain: Before I finished building the code, I debugged FE, and I failed all the time. Idea hints that no files can be found. Later, after consulting with morningman in wechat group, it was understood that `mvn install -DskipTests` does not need to execute `mvn generate-sources` after execution. This is inconsistent with the description in the document and needs to be corrected.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-05T13:07:05Z","updated_at":"2021-12-13T08:26:46Z","closed_at":"2021-12-13T08:26:46Z","merged_at":"2021-12-13T08:26:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"ef2ea1806e4fb77369ab17a02d20fc8a286be43e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1127326390,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTI3MzI2Mzkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/good%20first%20issue","name":"good

Proposed changes\r\n\r\ndate_trunc() is a very useful function in Hive, MySQL and Presto. We should add it to Doris. The date_trunc document and some test case is added to this commit, and the implementation code will be supplemented by others. \r\n\r\nBy the way, in my understanding, the registration of functions is involved, so the order of function implementation is BE to FE. I can complete the development of the FE side, but because my C++ is not very good, I hope someone will supplement the implementation of the BE side, and then I will attach the FE side code.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-04T15:16:25Z","updated_at":"2022-07-21T13:17:00Z","closed_at":"2022-07-21T13:16:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86b4bb4b45d21c1a2f2e75183e93d290328a6d23","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2040870921,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQwODcwOTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/area/sql/function","name":"area/sql/function","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nbrief description:\r\nthe tuple String Slot's ptr and len are not assigned appropriately on send side, the receive side may crash in some situation. \r\n\r\ndetail description:\r\non send side, when we call RowBatch::serialize(PRowBatch* output_batch) to pack RowBatch, the Tuple::deep_copy() will be called,  for each String Slot,  only String Slots that is not null will set ptr and len with proper value, the null String Slots will keep original status, the ptr member will point randomly and the len member may unexpect. \r\n\r\non recv side, unpack is processed by RowBatch::RowBatch(const RowDescriptor&, const PRowBatch&...), in this function, each String Slot will transfer offset to valid string_val->ptr whether the String Slot is null or not. \r\n\r\nbut some business logic depends on string_val->len=0, such as AggregateFuncTraits::init(), HyperLogLog::deserialize() will return correctly if slice.size<=0. so if string_val->len is set to 0 in send side, everything will be ok, otherwise server may crash.\r\n\r\nby netcomm viewpoint, we should make sure transfer correct data, it's sender's responsibility to set data with proper value, and do not make any presume which way the recv side will use it.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n-

Proposed changes\r\n[Improvement](Lateral view) Support lateral view based on subquery (#6746)\r\nissue: #6746\r\n\r\nSupport lateral view of the result column in subquery.\r\nFor example:\r\n  ```\r\n  select e1 from (select k2 as a from test_explode group by a) tmp1\r\n  lateral view explode_split(a, \",\") tmp2 as e1;\r\n  ```\r\nThe lateral view will parse the inline view column\r\nand put the table function node above the subquery.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nConvert the binary predicate of the form\r\n`<CastExpr<SlotRef(ResultType=BIGINT)>> <op><DecimalLiteral>` \r\nto the binary predicate of \r\n`<SlotRef(ResultType=BIGINT)> <new op> <new DecimalLiteral>`, \r\nthereby allowing the binary predicate The predicate pushes down and completes the bucket clipped.\r\n\r\nFor query `select * from T where t1 = 2.0`, when the ResultType of column t1 is equal to BIGINT, in the binary predicate analyze, the type will be unified to DECIMALV2, so the binary predicate will be converted to `<CastExpr<SlotRef>> <op In the form of ><DecimalLiteral>`, because Cast wraps the t1 column, it cannot be pushed down, resulting in poor performance.We convert it to the equivalent query `select * from T where t1 = 2` to push down and improve performance.\r\n\r\nSSB test:\r\n1. query `select * from LINEORDER3 where LO_ORDERKEY <2.2`\r\nPerformance improvement: `1.587s` -> `0.012s`,\r\nThe result and performance of `select * from LINEORDER3 where LO_ORDERKEY <3` are equivalent, and the other comparison methods are the same.\r\n2. query `select * from LINEORDER3 where LO_ORDERKEY = 2.2`\r\nPerformance improvement: `0.012s` -> `0.006`.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nWhen a broker load's task is failed, it may be retried by holding the\r\nLoadJob's write lock and submit loading task to a thread pool.\r\n\r\nBut submitting a task to thread pool may be blocked for at most 60 seconds\r\n(depends on BlockPolicy), so it will hold write lock for too long.\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Doris?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n- [ ] Code refactor (Modify the code structure, format the code, etc...)\r\n- [ ] Optimization. Including functional usability improvements and performance improvements.\r\n- [ ] Dependency. Such as changes related to third-party components.\r\n- [ ] Other.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have created an issue on (Fix #ISSUE) and described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] If these changes need document changes, I have updated the document\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at dev@doris.apache.org by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-30T05:42:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-07T01:58:50Z","closed_at":"2021-12-07T01:58:50Z","merged_at":"2021-12-07T01:58:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"03ad8c1fe39dd8a0974a00d8fdbde1a8b5f47139","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":665965626,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NjU5NjU2MjY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/doris/labels/kind/fix","name":"kind/fix","color":"e11d21","default":false,"description":"Categorizes
