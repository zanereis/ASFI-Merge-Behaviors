What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFor push based shuffle metrics, when writting out the event to log file, the field name is [\"Push Based Shuffle\"](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/JsonProtocol.scala#L548).\r\nBut when parsing it out in SHS, the expected field name is [\"Shuffle Push Read Metrics\"](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/util/JsonProtocol.scala#L1264). This mismatch makes all the push shuffle metrics 0 from SHS rest calls.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWithout this change, all the push shuffle metrics will not be rendered correctly through SHS rest calls.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nLaunched Spark-shell application in Yarn client mode in our cluster, get the log file to local, and started a local Spark History Server to parse the log file. The metrics are shown correctly after this patch.","created_at":"2023-04-12T00:04:04Z","updated_at":"2023-07-24T00:20:53Z","closed_at":"2023-07-24T00:20:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a7ebbd366b9fad6609a7ebae79a477d5bbbaabd0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40749/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40749/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40749/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/75a6bd6dbb4f7d9beb2fdc692455b6fc43deb97e","head":{"label":"linkedin:SPARK-43100","ref":"SPARK-43100","sha":"75a6bd6dbb4f7d9beb2fdc692455b6fc43deb97e","user":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":285879539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODU4Nzk1Mzk=","name":"spark","full_name":"linkedin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"linkedin","id":357098,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjM1NzA5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/357098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin","html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/linkedin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/linkedin/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds recursive query feature to Spark SQL.\r\n\r\nA recursive query is defined using the `WITH RECURSIVE` keywords and referring the name of the common table expression within the query.\r\nThe implementation complies with SQL standard and follows similar rules to other relational databases:\r\n- A query is made of an anchor followed by a recursive term.\r\n- The anchor terms doesn't contain self reference and it is used to initialize the query.\r\n- The recursive term contains a self reference and it is used to expand the current set of rows with new ones.\r\n- The anchor and recursive terms must be joined with each other by `UNION` or `UNION ALL` operators.\r\n- New rows can only be derived from the newly added rows of the previous iteration (or from the initial set of rows of anchor term). This limitation implies that recursive references can't be used with some of the joins, aggregations or subqueries.\r\n\r\nPlease see `cte-recursive.sql` for some examples.\r\n\r\nThe implemetation has the same limiation that [SPARK-36447](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36447) / https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/33671 has: \r\n\r\n> With-CTEs mixed with SQL commands or DMLs will still go through the old inline code path because of our non-standard language specs and not-unified command/DML interfaces.\r\n\r\nwhich means that recursive queries are not supported in SQL commands and DMLs.\r\nWith https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42036 this restriction is lifted and a recursive CTE only doesn't work when the CTE is force inlined (`spark.sql.legacy.inlineCTEInCommands=true` or the command is a multi-insert statement).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRecursive query is an ANSI SQL feature that is useful to process hierarchical data.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, adds recursive query feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new UTs and tests in `cte-recursion.sql`.

However, this is done in a tricky way, as `PythonUDF` does not extend `AggregateFunction` and we need to add special handling of it here and there. This is pretty error-prone, and we have hit issues such as https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39824\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `PythonUDAF` expression which extends `AggregateFunction`. Now python udaf will be handled the same as normal aggregate functions, except for the places that we need to extract python functions. After this, we can remove most of the special handling of `PythonUDF`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr aims to refactor `Add a directory when spark.sql.legacy.addSingleFileInAddFile set to false` in `HiveCatalogedDDLSuite` to test using a temporary directory with non-fixed root directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBefore this PR, this test case used a fixed directory `/tmp/spark/addDirectory/` as the root directory of the temporary directory for testing, this can lead to the following scenarios\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Execute the following command to test \r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -Phadoop-3 -pl sql/hive -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveCatalogedDDLSuite -am\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Execute `ls -R /tmp/spark`, we can see the permission of the `/tmp/spark/addDirectory` directory is `drwxrwxr-x` and  the content of `/tmp/spark/addDirectory`  was cleaned up, but the xx directory still exists\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/spark:\r\ntotal 4\r\ndrwxrwxr-x 2 userA groupA 4096 Apr 11 10:55 addDirectory\r\n\r\n/tmp/spark/addDirectory:\r\ntotal 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Switch to userB to re-run the test commands\r\n\r\n```\r\nbuild/mvn clean install -Phadoop-3 -pl sql/hive -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.hive.execution.HiveCatalogedDDLSuite -am\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen we can see the test fail with following message:\r\n\r\n```\r\n- Add a directory when spark.sql.legacy.addSingleFileInAddFile set to false *** FAILED ***\r\n  java.io.IOException: Failed to create a temp directory (under /tmp/spark/addDirectory/) after 10 attempts!\r\n  at org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.createDirectory(Utils.scala:314)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.util.Utils$.createTempDir(Utils.scala:334)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.DDLSuite.$anonfun$new$371(DDLSuite.scala:2497)\r\n  at org.scalatest.OutcomeOf.outcomeOf(OutcomeOf.scala:85)\r\n  at org.scalatest.OutcomeOf.outcomeOf$(OutcomeOf.scala:83)\r\n  at org.scalatest.OutcomeOf$.outcomeOf(OutcomeOf.scala:104)\r\n  at org.scalatest.Transformer.apply(Transformer.scala:22)\r\n  at org.scalatest.Transformer.apply(Transformer.scala:20)\r\n  at org.scalatest.funsuite.AnyFunSuiteLike$$anon$1.apply(AnyFunSuiteLike.scala:226)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.SparkFunSuite.withFixture(SparkFunSuite.scala:190)\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this pr changes the case to use a temporary directory with non-fixed root directory for tesing to solve the bad case mentioned above, and ensure the temporary directory for testing under root dir is better cleaned up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Manual checked: the temporary directory has been cleaned from the first level under root after

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure Spark satisfies distribution and ordering requirements during CTAS/RTAS by carrying the analyzed plan to exec nodes and building `AppendData` for the new table.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed for multiple reasons:\r\n- Some data sources may require a specific distribution/ordering/num partitions for **correctness**. All of that information is now being requested from Spark via `RequiresDistributionAndOrdering`, which is ignored by CTAS/RTAS commands. As a result, a data source may ask for a particular distribution or ordering and Spark may not respect it. This can cause correctness issues.\r\n- Ignoring `RequiresDistributionAndOrdering` may severely degrade the write **performance** or even fail jobs as the underlying write may produce lots of small files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport bin pack task scheduling on executors. This is controlled by `spark.scheduler.binPack.enabled`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDynamic allocation only remove or decommission idle executors. The default task scheduler use round robin to do task assignment on executors. This leads to resource waste.\r\n\r\nFor example, we have 4 tasks to run, 4 executors(each has 4 cpu cores). Default task scheduler will assign 1 task per executors. With bin pack, 1 executor will be assigned 4 tasks, then dynamic allocation could remove other 3 idle executors to reduce resource waste.\r\n\r\nIn prod, we have seen 20~50 percent resource save based on executor size, the more saving with more cpu cores per executor. For the issue could be caused by bin-packed executors, it's still possible to happen when all executor cores are occupied. If it indeed happen, the better solution might be large partition num.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of change is to provide one more scheduling option, customer still can use the old way.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test in TaskSchedulerImplSuite\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-10T23:16:52Z","updated_at":"2023-07-31T00:20:23Z","closed_at":"2023-07-31T00:20:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3ba9d56a7dac0ed41bd6f5fe7b0b1514a44c73a5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40730/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40730/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40730/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6bb1a2748986f161da0f3d80c82af20fea8e99bd","head":{"label":"warrenzhu25:binpack","ref":"binpack","sha":"6bb1a2748986f161da0f3d80c82af20fea8e99bd","user":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":217627454,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTc2Mjc0NTQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"warrenzhu25/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"warrenzhu25","id":1633312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2MzMzMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1633312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25","html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/warrenzhu25/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/warrenzhu25/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds the mapGroup and coGroup support for Scala client.\r\nThe client exposes the same SQL API to users, but uses an internal impl of the `KeyValueGroupedDatasetImpl` to keep track of initial types of the grouping keys and values. This is needed to support `keyAs` and `mapValues` type modifications to the dataset.\r\n\r\nIt adds one the sorting expression into the proto so that the sorting expressions can be passed to the server.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAPI completion.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd new Scala Client `KeyValueGroupedDataset` APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nClient E2E tests that only work for SBT due to UDFUtil not synced to the server with maven build.\r\nThe maven tests will be address in a follow up

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nParquet has supported vector read speed up with this PR https://github.com/apache/parquet-mr/pull/1011\r\nThe performance gain is 4x ~ 8x according to the parquet microbenchmark\r\nTPC-H(SF100) Q6 has 11% performance increase with Apache Spark integrating parquet vector optimization\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR used to support parquet vector optimization\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nAdd configuration spark.sql.parquet.vector512.read.enabled, If true and CPU contains avx512vbmi & avx512_vbmi2 instruction set, parquet decodes using Java Vector API. For Intel CPU, Ice Lake or newer contains the required instruction set.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nFor the test case, there are some problems to fix:\r\n1. It is necessary to Parquet-mr community release new java version to use the parquet vector optimization.\r\n2. Parquet Vector optimization does not release default, so users have to build parquet with mvn clean install -P vector-plugins manually to get the parquet-encoding-vector-{VERSION}.jar and put it on the {SPARK_HOME}/jars path\r\n3. github doesn't support select runners with specific instruction set. So it is impossible (a self-hosted runner can do it) to verify the optimization on github runners machine.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-10T03:26:11Z","updated_at":"2023-07-22T00:21:30Z","closed_at":"2023-07-22T00:21:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d770d10a5c81970ec6bb3c716eb4e6de561ff00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40719/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40719/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40719/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dff133889b083ba2d0a6240bc460e66c83b8c94b","head":{"label":"jiangjiguang:SPARK-42696","ref":"SPARK-42696","sha":"dff133889b083ba2d0a6240bc460e66c83b8c94b","user":{"login":"jiangjiguang","id":12368495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzY4NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12368495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangjiguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":502962135,"node_id":"R_kgDOHfqX1w","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangjiguang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangjiguang","id":12368495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzY4NDk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12368495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangjiguang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangjiguang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangjiguang/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange tests to avoid replacing and dropping a temporary view that is created in `SubquerySuite#beforeAll`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWhen I added a test for SPARK-42937, it tried to use the view `t`, which is created in `beforeAll`. But because other tests would replace and drop this view, the new test would fail. As a result, that new test had to re-create `t` from scratch.\r\n\r\nThis change will allow `t` to be used by new tests.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-09T19:43:09Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T22:22:55Z","closed_at":"2023-04-10T00:42:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"efeca0f961504300b9b2dd9723207093745d5928","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40717/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40717/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40717/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ce606b89a3f829a11efe2033c0c4bdfc8b60f650","head":{"label":"bersprockets:bad_drop_view","ref":"bad_drop_view","sha":"ce606b89a3f829a11efe2033c0c4bdfc8b60f650","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

Recursively visits all subexpressions regardless of whether the current expression is a conditional expression.\r\n* For each common expression:\r\n  * Add a new boolean variable subExprInit to indicate whether it has  already been evaluated. \r\n  * Add a new code block in CodeGenSupport trait, and reset those subExprInit variables to false before the physical operators begin to evaluate the input row.\r\n  * Add a new wrapper subExpr function for each common subexpression.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void subExpr_n(${argList}) {\r\n if (!subExprInit_n) {\r\n   ${eval.code}\r\n   subExprInit_n = true;\r\n   subExprIsNull_n = ${eval.isNull};\r\n   subExprValue_n = ${eval.value};\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  * When generating the input expression code,  if the input expression is a common expression, the expression code will be replaced with the corresponding subExpr function. When the subExpr function is called for the first time, subExprInit will be set to true, and the subsequent function calls will do nothing.\r\n\r\n#### Why should we support whole-stage subexpression elimination\r\n\r\nRight now each spark physical operator shares nothing but the input row, so the same expressions may be evaluated multiple times across different operators. For example, the expression udf(c1, c2) in plan Project [udf(c1, c2)] - Filter [udf(c1, c2) > 0] - Relation will be evaluated both in Project and Filter operators.  We can reuse the expression results across different operators such as Project and Filter.\r\n\r\n#### How to support whole-stage subexpression elimination\r\n\r\n* Add two properties in CodegenSupport trait, the reusable expressions and the the output attributes, we can reuse the expression results only if the output attributes are the same.\r\n* Visit all operators from top to bottom, bound the candidate expressions with the output attributes and add to the current candidate reusable expressions.\r\n* Visit all operators from bottom to top, collect all the common expressions to the current operator, and add the initialize code to the current operator if the common expressions have not been initialized.\r\n* Replace the common expressions code when generating codes for  the physical operators.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSupport more subexpression elimination cases, improve performance.\r\n\r\nFor example, TPCDS q23b query,  we can reuse the result of projection `sum(ss_quantity * ss_sales_price)` in the if expressions:\r\n```\r\nif (isnull((cast(input[2, int, true] as decimal(10,0)) * input[3, decimal(7,2), true])))\r\n   input[0, decimal(28,2), true]\r\nelse \r\n   (input[0, decimal(28,2), true] + cast(knownnotnull((cast(input[2, int, true] as decimal(10,0)) * input[3, decimal(7,2), true])) as decimal(28,2)))\r\n```\r\nq4, q62, q67 are similar to the above.\r\n\r\n| Query    | Time with PR | Time without PR | Time diff | Percentage

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR extends column default support to allow the ORDER BY, LIMIT, and OFFSET clauses at the end of a SELECT query in the INSERT source relation.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table t1(i boolean, s bigint default 42) using parquet;\r\ninsert into t1 values (true, 41), (false, default);\r\ncreate table t2(i boolean default true, s bigint default 42, \r\n                t string default 'abc') using parquet;\r\ninsert into t2 (i, s) select default, s from t1 order by s limit 1;\r\nselect * from t2;\r\n> true, 41L, \"abc\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis improves usability and helps prevent confusing error messages.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, SQL queries that previously failed will now succeed.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new unit test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the error class resource file in Kafka connector from test to src, so that error class works without test artifacts.\r\n\r\n###

enough.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan spark-shell with Kafka connector artifacts (without test artifacts) and triggered KafkaExceptions to confirm that exception is properly

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new AES mode for the `aes_encrypt()`/`aes_decrypt()` functions - `CBC` ([Cipher Block Chaining](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=operation-cipher-block-chaining-cbc-mode)) with the padding `PKCS7(5)`. The `aes_encrypt()` function returns a binary value which consists of the following fields:\r\n1. The salt magic prefix `Salted__` with the length of 8 bytes.\r\n2. A salt generated per every `aes_encrypt()` call using `java.security.SecureRandom`. Its length is 8 bytes.\r\n3. The encrypted input.\r\n\r\nThe encrypt function derives the secret key and initialization vector (16 bytes) from the salt and user's key using the same algorithm as OpenSSL's `EVP_BytesToKey()` (versions >= 1.1.0c).\r\n\r\nThe `aes_decrypt()` functions assumes that its input has the fields as showed above.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql> SELECT base64(aes_encrypt('Apache Spark', '0000111122223333', 'CBC', 'PKCS'));\r\nU2FsdGVkX1/ERGxwEOTDpDD4bQvDtQaNe+gXGudCcUk=\r\nspark-sql> SELECT aes_decrypt(unbase64('U2FsdGVkX1/ERGxwEOTDpDD4bQvDtQaNe+gXGudCcUk='), '0000111122223333', 'CBC', 'PKCS');\r\nApache Spark\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo achieve feature parity with other systems/frameworks, and make the migration process from them to Spark SQL easier. For example, the `CBC` mode is supported by:\r\n- BigQuery: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/aead-encryption-concepts#block_cipher_modes\r\n- Snowflake: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/encrypt.html\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new checks:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/testOnly *QueryExecutionErrorsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"sql/test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.expressions.ExpressionInfoSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.MiscFunctionsSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n```\r\nand checked compatibility with LibreSSL/OpenSSL:\r\n```\r\n$ openssl version\r\nLibreSSL 3.3.6\r\n$ echo -n 'Apache Spark' | openssl enc -e -aes-128-cbc -pass pass:0000111122223333 -a\r\nU2FsdGVkX1+5GyAmmG7wDWWDBAuUuxjMy++cMFytpls=\r\n```\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT aes_decrypt(unbase64('U2FsdGVkX1+5GyAmmG7wDWWDBAuUuxjMy++cMFytpls='), '0000111122223333', 'CBC');\r\nApache Spark\r\n```\r\ndecrypt Spark's output by OpenSSL:\r\n```sql\r\nspark-sql (default)> SELECT

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR adds a new API `PartitionEvaluator` to define the computing logic and requires the caller side to explicitly list what needs to be serialized and sent to executors via `PartitionEvaluatorFactory`.\r\n\r\nTwo new RDD APIs are added to use `PartitionEvaluator`:\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * Return a new RDD by applying an evaluator to each partition of this RDD. The given evaluator\r\n   * factory will be serialized and sent to executors, and each task will create an evaluator with\r\n   * the factory, and use the evaluator to transform the data of the input partition.\r\n   */\r\n  @DeveloperApi\r\n  @Since(\"3.5.0\")\r\n  def mapPartitionsWithEvaluator[U: ClassTag](\r\n      partitionEvaluatorFactory: PartitionEvaluatorFactory[T, U]): RDD[U] = withScope {\r\n    new MapPartitionsWithEvaluatorRDD(this, taskEvaluatorFactory)\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * Zip this RDD's partitions with another RDD and return a new RDD by applying an evaluator to\r\n   * the zipped partitions. Assumes that the two RDDs have the *same number of partitions*, but\r\n   * does *not* require them to have the same number of elements in each partition.\r\n   */\r\n  @DeveloperApi\r\n  @Since(\"3.5.0\")\r\n  def zipPartitionsWithEvaluator[U: ClassTag](\r\n      rdd2: RDD[T],\r\n      partitionEvaluatorFactory: PartitionEvaluatorFactory[T, U]): RDD[U] = withScope {\r\n    new ZippedPartitionsWithEvaluatorRDD(this, rdd2, partitionEvaluatorFactory)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThree SQL operators are updated to use the new API to do execution, as a showcase: Project, Filter, WholeStageCodegen. We can migrate more operators later. A config is added to still use the old code path by default.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nUsing lambda to define the computing logic is a bit tricky:\r\n1. it's easy to mistakenly reference objects in the closure, which increases the time to serialize the lambda and sent to executors. `ProjectExec` and `FilterExec` use `child.output` in the lambda which means the entire `child` will be serialized. There are other places trying to avoid this problem, e.g. https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/v3.3.2/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/Columnar.scala#L90-L92\r\n2. serializing lambda is strongly discouraged by the [official Java guide](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/lambdaexpressions.html#serialization). We should eventually get rid of lambda during distributed execution to make Spark more robust.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nEnable unit tests and doctests for streaming queries. A lot are skipped and needs to be un-skipped as the development goes on. \r\n\r\nNote that I also separated the `{foreach, foreachBatch}` tests from the original test suite. Because currently they are not implemented in connect and it seems unnecessary to manually add a skip for all of them in `StreamingParityTests`. Also it doesn't hurt to separate them I think as these tests are large enough already.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMore tests is always better than less.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nIt's test itself.","created_at":"2023-04-06T22:24:40Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T00:06:05Z","closed_at":"2023-04-13T00:06:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d49f76335d3aeedf4439eeca7aa15b98dd40da19","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR changes the implementation of MapOutputTracker.updateMapOutput() to search for the MapStatus under the help of a mapping from mapId to mapIndex, previously it was performing a linear search, which would become performance bottleneck if a large proportion of all blocks in the map are migrated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo avoid performance bottleneck when block decommission is enabled and a lot of blocks are migrated within a short time window.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's pure performance improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-06T22:10:30Z","updated_at":"2023-08-02T16:17:11Z","closed_at":"2023-05-16T18:34:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1cebbf9fd969ab7ee3c5db440fb6a8de86eb749d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40690/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40690/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40690/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c4ef726948d5b586b5ac75eb8b1536536c01cb2a","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:SPARK-43043","ref":"SPARK-43043","sha":"c4ef726948d5b586b5ac75eb8b1536536c01cb2a","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

Instead, they are applied in the createQueryStages() method. And createQueryStages() is bottom-up, which causes the exchange to be eliminated to be wrapped in a layer of ShuffleQueryStage first, making CoalesceBucketsInJoin unrecognizable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

JIRA\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-43051\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, when deserializing protobufs using `from_protobuf`, fields that are not explicitly present in the serialized message are deserialized as null in the resulting struct. However this includes singular proto3 scalars set explicitly to their default values, as they will [not appear](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/field_presence/#presence-in-tag-value-stream-wire-format-serialization) in the serialized protobuf.\r\n\r\nFor example, given a message format like\r\n\r\n```\r\nsyntax = \"proto3\";\r\n\r\nmessage Person {\r\n  string name = 1;\r\n  int64 age = 2;\r\n  optional string middle_name = 3;\r\n  optional int64 salary = 4;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand an example message like\r\n```\r\nSearchRequest(age = 0, middle_name = \"\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe result from calling `from_protobuf` on the serialized form of the above message would be\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"name\": null, \"age\": null, \"middle_name\": \"\", \"salary\": null}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can be useful to deserialize these fields as their defaults, e.g.:\r\n```\r\n{\"name\": \"\", \"age\": 0, \"middle_name\": \"\", \"salary\": null}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior also exists in other major libraries, e.g. `includingDefaultValues` in [jsonformat](https://protobuf.dev/reference/java/api-docs/com/google/protobuf/util/JsonFormat.Printer.html#includingDefaultValueFields--), or `emitDefaults` in [jsonpb](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang/protobuf/jsonpb#Marshaler).\r\n\r\nIn this PR I implemented this behavior by adding an option, `emit.default.values` that can be passed to the options map for `from_protobuf` which controls whether to materialize these defaults or not.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdditional functionality to help control the deserialization behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it provides a new option that can be accepted by `from_protobuf`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added test cases that assert the deserialization behavior for unset and default values for every type in proto2 and proto3.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-06T15:03:29Z","updated_at":"2023-05-04T04:08:19Z","closed_at":"2023-05-04T04:08:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6a0725d680aa761cbd7547ac66b985328ae51ebd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pang-wu","id":104795337,"node_id":"U_kgDOBj8MyQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104795337?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu","html_url":"https://github.com/pang-wu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pang-wu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40686/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40686/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40686/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a0bd802157180befbc8fef53bbec93c0f543d9b1","head":{"label":"justaparth:parth/allow-materializing-default-protobuf-deserialization","ref":"parth/allow-materializing-default-protobuf-deserialization","sha":"a0bd802157180befbc8fef53bbec93c0f543d9b1","user":{"login":"justaparth","id":1002986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth","html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":610834975,"node_id":"R_kgDOJGiaHw","name":"spark","full_name":"justaparth/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"justaparth","id":1002986,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDI5ODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002986?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth","html_url":"https://github.com/justaparth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justaparth/repos","events_url":"https://a

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd check for operations that involve multiple data frames,  because spark do not support joining for example two data frames from different Spark Connect Sessions.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSpark do not support joining for example two data frames from different Spark Connect Sessions. To avoid exceptions, the client should clearly fail when it tries to construct such a composition.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd new test\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/36726 supports TimestampNTZ type in JDBC data source and https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37013 applies a fix to pass more test cases with H2.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that Java Timestamp is a poorly defined class and different JDBC drivers implement \"getTimestamp\" and \"setTimestamp\" with different expected behaviors in mind. The general conversion implementation would work with some JDBC dialects and their drivers but not others. This issue is discovered when testing with PostgreSQL database.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `dialect` parameter to `makeGetter` for applying dialect specific conversions when reading a Java Timestamp into TimestampNTZType. `makeSetter` already has a `dialect` field and we will use that for converting back to Java Timestamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix TimestampNTZ support for PostgreSQL. Allows other JDBC dialects to provide dialect specific implementation for\r\nconverting between Java Timestamp and Spark TimestampNTZType.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit test.\r\nI added new test cases for `PostgresIntegrationSuite` to cover TimestampNTZ read and writes.","created_at":"2023-04-05T18:50:03Z","updated_at":"2023-05-05T02:07:00Z","closed_at":"2023-05-05T02:07:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f603a637cbdda4794aeb86872c480b436a34c070","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40678/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40678/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40678/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/92b02c23bdbab08d0503053dbb71410f3c5fafb3","head":{"label":"tianhanhu:SPARK-43040_jdbc_timestamp_ntz","ref":"SPARK-43040_jdbc_timestamp_ntz","sha":"92b02c23bdbab08d0503053dbb71410f3c5fafb3","user":{"login":"tianhanhu","id":30429546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDI5NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30429546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu","html_url":"https://github.com/tianhanhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":287837559,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODc4Mzc1NTk=","name":"spark","full_name":"tianhanhu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tianhanhu","id":30429546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNDI5NTQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30429546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu","html_url":"https://github.com/tianhanhu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tianhanhu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tianhanhu/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAllow `FileFormat` instances to define the schema of the `_metadata` column they expose.\r\n \r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nToday, the schema of the file source `_metadata` column depends on the file format (e.g. parquet file format supports `_metadata.row_index`) but this is hard-wired into the `FileFormat` itself. Not only is this an ugly design, it also prevents custom file formats from adding their own fields to the `_metadata` column.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.","created_at":"2023-04-05T15:45:39Z","updated_at":"2023-04-12T03:03:43Z","closed_at":"2023-04-12T03:03:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a9f4f8a5340339fd727ce1bbdfd846fbc09a6e0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBy default, scripts in `connector/connect/bin` rebuild the necessary JARs using SBT. Even when this build is incremental and there were no changes, the sbt rebuild takes about 4 minutes. Another issue is that launching the `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect`, `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-shell`, `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client` scripts in parallel causes the two sbt builds to clash. So developer has to wait for one to finish before launching the other.\r\n\r\nBy supplying an env var option `BUILD=0` the build step can be skipped:\r\n```\r\nBUILD=0 ./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect\r\nBUILD=0 ./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-shell\r\nBUILD=0 ./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client\r\n```\r\nAt the same time, add a new script `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-build` to rebuild both the server and client part:\r\n```\r\n./connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-build\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter doing that, it's still slow to have sbt retrieve the classpath of the scala client at each startup. With `connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client-classpath` and new `SCCLASSPATH` env argument, it's possible to save it to a file:\r\n```\r\nconnector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client-classpath > ./scclasspath\r\nBUILD=0 SCCLASSPATH=$(cat ./scclasspath) connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-scala-client\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImproving inner dev loop.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual build, using the scripts.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-05T14:06:14Z","updated_at":"2023-04-13T00:36:03Z","closed_at":"2023-04-07T01:40:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3402d0820356e3d6b9aba2346f07aa849f0fef59","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40676/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40676/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40676/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/bf3c2c680194a4f548e38a446a9a6a8847621211","head":{"label":"juliuszsompolski:SPARK-42656-BUILD-option","ref":"SPARK-42656-BUILD-option","sha":"bf3c2c680194a4f548e38a446a9a6a8847621211","user":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":82301030,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MjMwMTAzMA==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"juliuszsompolski","id":25019163,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDE5MTYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25019163?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski","html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/juliuszsompolski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/juliuszsompolski/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the concept of a `ClassFinder` that is able to scrape the REPL output (either file-based or in-memory based) for generated class files.  The `ClassFinder` is registered during initialization of the REPL and aids in uploading the generated class files as artifacts to the Spark Connect server.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo run UDFs which are defined on the client side REPL, we require a mechanism that can find the local REPL classfiles and then utilise the mechanism from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-42653 to transfer them to the server as artifacts.  \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, users can now run UDFs on the default (ammonite) REPL with spark connect.\r\n\r\nInput (in REPL):\r\n```\r\nclass A(x: Int) { def get = x * 5 + 19 }\r\ndef dummyUdf(x: Int): Int = new A(x).get\r\nval myUdf = udf(dummyUdf _)\r\nspark.range(5).select(myUdf(col(\"id\"))).as[Int].collect()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nArray[Int] = Array(19, 24, 29, 34, 39)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUnit tests + E2E

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39294 that proposes to remove the breaking change detection within `master` branch. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nApache Spark does not guarantee the compatibility between individual commits but between releases according to semantic versioning.\r\n\r\nIt would have been great if we can use this job as a sort of warning but this feature is missing in GitHub Actions. See also:\r\n- https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/15452\r\n- https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/2347\r\n\r\nTherefore, we cannot use this as a warning.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nWill be tested within my fork first.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-05T07:40:55Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:50Z","closed_at":"2023-04-09T05:55:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f7884251d8574d846f1684b93016b2acb30debb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982110661,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMTEwNjYx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/INFRA","name":"INFRA","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40673/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40673/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40673/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/022564f3af04e2cb6861228e04908a114930b7b8","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-41537-followup","ref":"SPARK-41537-followup","sha":"022564f3af04e2cb6861228e04908a114930b7b8","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBuilding the project against jdk11 on IDE shows errors because `Platform.java` depends on `sun.misc` which is in `jdk.unsupported` module in jdk11. The problem goes away when we pass `java.version` as `11` to maven as system D parameters.\r\n\r\nThis PR set `java.version` to `11` by detecting jdk version automatically and improves build experience.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nIt makes build experience on IDE against jdk11 smoother.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUsers won't have to specify java.version in maven parameters any more since the profile gets activated automagically based on the jdk version.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis patch was tested by building locally.","created_at":"2023-04-04T19:12:06Z","updated_at":"2023-07-15T00:22:41Z","closed_at":"2023-07-15T00:22:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ad007f7e62b99967665b0214384edc4099571d4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40667/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40667/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40667/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/89438d4b9190190f4a1f2bb8cacc8f9c70cf05bb","head":{"label":"ksumit:master","ref":"master","sha":"89438d4b9190190f4a1f2bb8cacc8f9c70cf05bb","user":{"login":"ksumit","id":96373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit","html_url":"https://github.com/ksumit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":623626209,"node_id":"R_kgDOJSvH4Q","name":"spark","full_name":"ksumit/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ksumit","id":96373,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2Mzcz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/96373?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit","html_url":"https://github.com/ksumit","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ksumit/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ksumit/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change API of parameterized SQL, and replace type of argument values from `string` to `Any` in Scala/Java/Python and `Expression.Literal` in protobuf API. Language API can accept `Any` objects from which it is possible to construct literal expressions.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40623\r\n\r\n#### Scala/Java:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  def sql(sqlText: String, args: Map[String, Any]): DataFrame\r\n```\r\nvalues of the `args` map are wrapped by the `lit()` function which leaves `Column` as is and creates a literal from other Java/Scala objects (for more details see the `Scala` tab at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html).\r\n\r\n#### Python:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef sql(self, sqlQuery: str, args: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, **kwargs: Any) -> DataFrame:\r\n```\r\nSimilarly to Scala/Java `sql`, Python's `sql()` accepts Python objects as values of the `args` dictionary (see more details about acceptable Python objects at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-datatypes.html). `sql()` converts dictionary values to `Column` literal expressions by `lit()`.\r\n\r\n#### Protobuf:\r\n\r\n```proto\r\nmessage SqlCommand {\r\n  // (Required) SQL Query.\r\n  string sql = 1;\r\n\r\n  // (Optional) A map of parameter names to literal expressions.\r\n  map<string, Expression.Literal> args = 2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```scala\r\nscala> val sqlText = \"\"\"SELECT s FROM VALUES ('Jeff /*__*/ Green'), ('E\\'Twaun Moore') AS t(s) WHERE s = :player_name\"\"\"\r\nsqlText: String = SELECT s FROM VALUES ('Jeff /*__*/ Green'), ('E\\'Twaun Moore') AS t(s) WHERE s = :player_name\r\n\r\nscala> sql(sqlText, args = Map(\"player_name\" -> lit(\"E'Twaun Moore\"))).show(false)\r\n+-------------+\r\n|s            |\r\n+-------------+\r\n|E'Twaun Moore|\r\n+-------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current implementation the parameterized `sql()` requires arguments as string values parsed to SQL literal expressions that causes the following issues:\r\n1. SQL comments are skipped while parsing, so, some fragments of input might be skipped. For example, `'Europe -- Amsterdam'`. In this case, `-- Amsterdam` is excluded from the input.\r\n2. Special chars in string values must be escaped, for instance `'E\\'Twaun Moore'`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo since the parameterized SQL feature https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38864 hasn't been released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the affected tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *ParametersSuite\"\r\n$ python/run-tests --parallelism=1 --testnames 'pyspark.sql.tests.connect.test_connect_basic SparkConnectBasicTests.test_sql_with_args'\r\n$ python/run-tests --parallelism=1 --testnames 'pyspark.sql.session SparkSession.sql'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Max Gekk <max.gekk@gmail.com>\r\n(cherry picked from commit

The race occurs between the `executor-heartbeater` thread and the thread executing the task. This data race is not known to cause issues on 2.12 but in 2.13 ~due this change https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9258~ (@LuciferYang bisected this to first cause failures in scala 2.13.7 one possible reason could be https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9786) leads to an uncaught exception in the `executor-heartbeater` thread, which means that the executor will eventually be terminated due to missing hearbeats.\r\n\r\nThis fix of using of using `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is cherry picked from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37206 where is was suggested as a fix by @LuciferYang since `TaskMetrics.externalAccums` is also accessed from outside the class `TaskMetrics`. The old PR was closed because at that point there was no clear understanding of the race condition. @JoshRosen commented here https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37206#issuecomment-1189930626 saying that there should be no such race based on because all accumulators should be deserialized as part of task deserialization here: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0cc96f76d8a4858aee09e1fa32658da3ae76d384/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/executor/Executor.scala#L507-L508 and therefore no writes should occur while the hearbeat thread will read the accumulators. But my understanding is that is incorrect as accumulators will also be deserialized as part of the taskBinary here: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/169f828b1efe10d7f21e4b71a77f68cdd1d706d6/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/ShuffleMapTask.scala#L87-L88 which will happen while the heartbeater thread is potentially reading the accumulators. This can both due to user code using accumulators (see the new test case) but also when using the Dataframe/Dataset API as  sql metrics will also be `externalAccums`. One way metrics will be sent as part of the taskBinary is when the dep is a `ShuffleDependency`: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fbbcf9434ac070dd4ced4fb9efe32899c6db12a9/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/Dependency.scala#L85 with a ShuffleWriteProcessor that comes from https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fbbcf9434ac070dd4ced4fb9efe32899c6db12a9/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/ShuffleExchangeExec.scala#L411-L422 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe rule `DeduplicateRelations` finds duplicated relations and renew their output attribute IDs. For performance reasons, it uses object references to find duplicated relations. This is fine as duplicated relations only happen with DataFrame queries. For SQL query, the table look-up always returns the scan relation with fresh attribute IDs.\r\n\r\nHowever, with metadata columns, the analyzer will copy a scan relation with new output attributes to include metadata cols. The object references check does not work anymore as two different scan relation instances may have the same attribute IDs.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this problem by looking at the output attribute IDs to check duplicated relations.\r\n\r\nNote that, `CTERelationRef` has the same problem as Spark always creates a new instance of it. The golden file changes are caused by the CTE fix.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew test. I also ran `TPCDSQuerySuite` locally. The runtime of rule `DeduplicateRelations` does not change much.","created_at":"2023-04-04T14:38:48Z","updated_at":"2024-06-03T09:39:38Z","closed_at":"2023-04-07T03:46:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ea068d36c3e3dd192924a14aabfe57873753ed3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40662/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40662/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40662/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1a5fd070997713ae9df34a430b375a1ac6942cfb","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:dedup","ref":"dedup","sha":"1a5fd070997713ae9df34a430b375a1ac6942cfb","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are a lot of SQL with union multiple subquery with filter in user scenarios. Take an example,\r\n**q1**\r\n```\r\nSELECT ss_item_sk, ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk\r\nFROM store_sales\r\n\tLEFT JOIN store_returns\r\n\tON sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk AND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number\r\nWHERE sr_return_amt > 10000\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT ss_item_sk, ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk\r\nFROM store_sales\r\n\tLEFT JOIN store_returns\r\n\tON sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk AND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number\r\nWHERE sr_return_amt < 1000\r\n```\r\nIn fact, we can simplify this SQL as\r\n```\r\nSELECT ss_item_sk, ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk\r\nFROM store_sales\r\n\tLEFT JOIN store_returns\r\n\tON sr_item_sk = ss_item_sk\r\n\t\tAND sr_ticket_number = ss_ticket_number\r\nWHERE sr_return_amt > 10000 OR sr_return_amt < 1000\r\n```\r\n**q2**\r\n```\r\nSELECT ss_item_sk, ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk\r\nFROM store_sales\r\nWHERE ss_ext_discount_amt > 1000\r\nUNION ALL\r\nSELECT ss_item_sk, ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk\r\nFROM store_sales\r\nWHERE ss_ext_discount_amt < 100\r\n```\r\nIn fact, we can simplify this SQL as\r\n```\r\nSELECT ss_item_sk, ss_ticket_number, ss_customer_sk\r\nFROM store_sales\r\nWHERE ss_ext_discount_amt > 1000 OR ss_ext_discount_amt < 100\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR optimizes `Union` operators if the children exists at least two `Filter` by:\r\n1. Eliminate `Union` operators if all the children are `Filter` and all the child of these `Filter`s are same. We just need merging the predicates into one single predicate by connecting these `Filter`s with `Or`.\r\n2. Combines multiple `Filter` operators into one if all the child of these `Filter`s are same. We just need merging the predicates into one single predicate by connecting these `Filter`s with `Or` too.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nSimply the SQL plan and improve the performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature and just update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test cases.\r\nThe micro benchmark for q1 and q2.\r\nBefore this PR\r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_311-b11 on Mac OS X 10.16\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\r\nTPCDS Snappy:

If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed per discussion that happened [here](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40308#discussion_r1127081206).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNullability exceptions will be thrown at runtime (instead of analysis) but there is no API change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR comes with tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-04-04T03:23:51Z","updated_at":"2023-04-05T08:18:12Z","closed_at":"2023-04-05T08:18:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ba0eda53dff76edc42e5bb23e921c934766069dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40655/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40655/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40655/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/622ee8a2e72718721ca6feead41f344dffc938d9","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-42855-v2","ref":"spark-42855-v2","sha":"622ee8a2e72718721ca6feead41f344dffc938d9","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a correctness bug for INSERT commands with timestamp literals. The bug manifests when:\r\n\r\n* An INSERT command includes a user-specified column list of fewer columns than the target table.\r\n* The provided values include timestamp literals.\r\n\r\nThe bug was that the long integer values stored in the rows to represent these timestamp literals were getting assigned back to `UnresolvedInlineTable` rows without the timestamp type. Then the analyzer inserted an implicit cast from `LongType` to `TimestampType` later, which incorrectly caused the value to change during execution.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the bug by propagating the timestamp type directly to the output table instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this PR fixes a correctness bug.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new unit test suite.","created_at":"2023-04-04T00:12:14Z","updated_at":"2023-06-08T18:33:50Z","closed_at":"2023-04-06T04:16:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d70ddd31773a0d49533c88dcaa46983deb8a58f6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40652/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40652/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40652/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ad44ff6937516b60006b699784909fd02d34c055","head":{"label":"dtenedor:assign-correct-insert-types","ref":"assign-correct-insert-types","sha":"ad44ff6937516b60006b699784909fd02d34c055","user":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":592933002,"node_id":"R_kgDOI1dwig","name":"spark","full_name":"dtenedor/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor/spark","description":"Apache
