uses `get-pip.py`. When using this with the setuptools >= 60.0, it results in an error mentioned in  https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/22621 here. \r\n\r\nWe need to update cibuildwheel to latest version if we want to use setuptools >= 60.0. More details on the bug can be found https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2993 here. \r\n\r\nWith the latest cibuildwheel, the aarch wheels takes longer time to build the wheel, resulting in time out.  Added a workaround for now.

uses `get-pip.py`. When using this with the setuptools >= 60.0, it results in an error mentioned in  https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/22621 here. \r\n\r\nWe need to update cibuildwheel to latest version if we want to use setuptools >= 60.0. More details on the bug can be found https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/2993 here. \r\n\r\nWith the latest cibuildwheel, the aarch wheels takes longer time to build the wheel, resulting in time out.  Added a workaround for now. Created an  issue at https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/22637\r\n\r\n\r\nfixes: https://github.com/apache/beam/issues/22621.

#22543\r\n\r\nWhen using multiple partitions for a BigQuery `FILE_LOADS` write, the user's dynamic destination type isn't properly passed into `UpdateSchemaDestination`. This leads to a `ClassCastException` when attempting to get the table and schema using the dynamic destination object.\r\n\r\nThe user's dynamic destination object is configured with a particular parameter type (represented by `DestinationT`) for `getTable()` and `getSchema` (see [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/70cee1d125db0b62b2d660fc399e5a23845eb0e3/sdks/java/io/google-cloud-platform/src/main/java/org/apache/beam/sdk/io/gcp/bigquery/DynamicDestinations.java#L147-L155)).

#22678\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the pandas - Beam type mapping from `apache_beam.dataframe.schemas` to `apache_beam.typehints.pandas_type_compatibility`, and modifies `apache_beam.dataframe.convert` to leverage that mapping by defining batch-producing and -consuming DoFns. \r\n\r\nThe new module now provides `BatchConverter` implementations that can be re-used in other DoFns that wish to process structured data using the pandas API.  It also makes one slight modification in the type mapping: we now have a special field option, `beam:dataframe:index:v1`. This option is used to indicate that a Beam schema field should map to an index in the pandas DataFrame type system. If a Beam schema has no fields identified as an index, then we assume the user does not care about the index, and a \"meaningless\" one will be generated when mapping to DataFrames. Similarly when mapping a DataFrame back to the Beam type system, the index will be dropped.\r\n\r\nNote `apache_beam.dataframe.schemas` still exists, for two purposes:\r\n- To maintain backwards compatibility, we still define `BatchRowsAsDataFrame` and `UnbatchPandas` transforms. These transforms are no longer used in `apache_beam.dataframe.convert` though.\r\n- To handle proxy generation and consumption (`generate_proxy`, `element_type_from_dataframe`). These functions _are_ still used in `apache_beam.dataframe.convert`.\r\n\r\nAll of the logic in `apache_beam.dataframe.schemas` defers to `apache_beam.typehints.pandas_type_compatibility` as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThe following PRs were separated from this one to ease review:\r\n- #22626\r\n- #22630\r\n- #22679\r\n- #22680\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

#22544 \r\n\r\nThis refactors the initial loading of examples that used to be in `playground_page_providers.dart`:\r\n- Example loading descriptors were introduced. Each descriptor contains all the info to load an example from a given source.\r\n- `StandardExampleLoadingDescriptor` defines loading by an example name.\r\n- `CatalogDefaultExampleLoadingDescriptor` defines loading the default example for a given SDK.\r\n- `EmptyExampleLoadingDescriptor` defines loading empty content while setting a given SDK.\r\n- An option to load arbitrary code with `code` query parameter was removed. It was not allowing to set SDK so it was likely not used in practice. It was only allowed in the embedded version thus introducing unwanted distinctions between the two views. Should we need this option, we must add a loading descriptor class for it.\r\n- Example loaders were introduced. Each loader class loads an example from a given source using a particular descriptor class.\r\n- `PlaygroundState` now links to `ExampleState`. This is because the loading complications were stemming from their separation. The loading code had to await events from both of them. `ExampleState` is no longer provided in the widget tree, all code consuming `ExampleState` from the tree was changed to consume `PlaygroundState`.\r\n\r\nAs we were completing 'Share any code' feature, this refactoring emerged as a requirement. Without it, adding another source of source code would render the old loading unmaintainable.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#21978.\r\n\r\nIn this PR:\r\n- Added 'share any code' feature.\r\n- Refactored dropdown offset calculation to accommodate the new button.\r\n- Refactored color theme handling because the new button did not fit the old theme handling.\r\n- Added `ExampleModel.sdk` because there are now cases when we can't take it anywhere else, and it also feels natural.\r\n- Fixed tests, they broke after adding sdk.\r\n\r\nMany thanks to @miamihotline who did 70% of the job but was interrupted.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
