PR fixes consumer close to avoid updating the subscription state object in the app thread. Now the close simply triggers an UnsubscribeEvent that is handled in the background to trigger callbacks, clear assignment, and send leave heartbeat. Note that after triggering the event, the unsubscribe will continuously process background events until the event completes, to ensure that it allows for callbacks to run in the app thread.\r\n\r\nThe logic around what happens if the unsubscribe fails remain unchanged: close will log, keep the first exception and carry on.  \r\n\r\nIt also removes the redundant LeaveOnClose event (it used to do the the exact same thing as the UnsubscribeEvent, both  calling membershipMgr.leaveGroup).

part of KIP-858 (Handle JBOD broker disk failure in KRaft), we added some code that caused the\r\nbroker to re-register itself when transitioning from a MetadataVersion that did not support broker\r\ndirectory IDs, to one that did. This code was necessary because otherwise the controller would not\r\nbe aware of what directories the broker held.\r\n\r\nHowever, prior to this PR, the re-registration process acted exactly like a full registration. That\r\nis, it bumped the broker epoch (which is meant to only be bumped on broker restart). This PR fixes\r\nthe code to keep the broker epoch the same if the incarnation ID is the same.\r\n\r\nThere are some other minor improvements here:\r\n\r\n- The previous logic relied on a complicated combination of request version and previous broker\r\n  epoch to understand if the request came from the same broker or not.

`GroupMetadataManager#toTopicPartitions`, we generate a list of `ConsumerGroupHeartbeatRequestData.TopicPartitions` from the input deserialized subscription. Currently the input subscription is `ConsumerPartitionAssignor.Subscription`, where the topic partitions are stored as (topic-partition) pairs, whereas in `ConsumerGroupHeartbeatRequestData.TopicPartitions`, we need the topic partitions to be stored as (topic-partition list) pairs.\r\n\r\n`ConsumerProtocolSubscription` is an intermediate data structure in the deserialization where the topic partitions are stored as (topic-partition list) pairs. This pr uses `ConsumerProtocolSubscription` instead as the input subscription to make `toTopicPartitions` more efficient. \r\n\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-16673\r\n\r\n###

to https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/16286.\r\n\r\nThis test is pretty flaky and has failed on 7% of all trunk builds in the last 90 days (see [Gradle Enterprise](https://ge.apache.org/scans/tests?search.startTimeMax=1718207141545&search.startTimeMin=1710388800000&search.tags=trunk&search.timeZoneId=America%2FNew_York&tests.container=org.apache.kafka.connect.integration.ExactlyOnceSourceIntegrationTest&tests.sortField=FLAKY)).\r\n\r\nPart of this test includes bringing up a separate Kafka cluster that is targeted by a source connector. We do not currently wait on the successful startup of that Kafka cluster before starting that connector, and we do not wait on the successful startup of the connector and its tasks before waiting for the connector to produce records within a bounded timeout.\r\n\r\nBy adding assertions that the separate Kafka cluster and the connector+tasks are healthy before waiting for the connector to produce records, we accomplish two things:\r\n- We reduce the chance of flaky failures by allowing more time to pass for more resource-intensive operations to complete (5 minutes for Kafka cluster startup and 2 minutes for connector+tasks startup, vs. 30 seconds for record production)\r\n- We also provide more granularity into possible causes of failure; if the separate Kafka cluster or the connector+tasks fail to start, tests should report that failure directly, instead of simply reporting that not enough records were produced in time\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a decent chance that this change will reduce flakiness for the affected test, the second benefit (more informative failure messages) is IMO significant enough that a close examination of logs for failed builds, multiple CI runs with this change, or other time-consuming efforts are not warranted.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI

PR refactors the ConsumerTaskTest. It extracts the single loop iteration within the run method of ConsumerTask into a separate method called ingestRecords. The refactored ConsumerTaskTest no longer calls ConsumerTask asynchronously through a background thread, but instead directly invokes the ingestRecords method at different times.\r\n\r\nAll the cases in ConsumerTaskTest have passed the tests.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-12T14:35:25Z","updated_at":"2024-06-20T19:35:30Z","closed_at":"2024-06-20T19:35:14Z","merged_at":"2024-06-20T19:35:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"64702bcf6f883d266ccffcec458b4c3c0706ad75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16303/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16303/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16303/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/e02dbfafd3c5aa698c5c20ff9b7b858d825c0061","head":{"label":"xiaoqingwanga:KAFKA-16862","ref":"KAFKA-16862","sha":"e02dbfafd3c5aa698c5c20ff9b7b858d825c0061","user":{"login":"xiaoqingwanga","id":38755949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzU1OTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38755949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoqingwanga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":813580298,"node_id":"R_kgDOMH5ACg","name":"kafka","full_name":"xiaoqingwanga/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoqingwanga","id":38755949,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4NzU1OTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/38755949?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoqingwanga","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoqingwanga/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoqingwanga/kafka","description":"Mirror

support for \"unclean.leader.election.enable\" config. This PR is based on this [PR](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/10463). What this PR did are:\r\n\r\n1. Let KRaft honor \"unclean.leader.election.enable\" config to trigger unclean leader election when necessary\r\n2. When dynamically enabling \"unclean.leader.election.enable\" config for a specific topic, the unclean leader election for that topic should be triggered.\r\n3. Enable `kafka.controller:type=ControllerStats,name=UncleanLeaderElectionsPerSec` metric in KRaft unclean leader election\r\n4. Add tests and enable integration tests for KRaft. Making sure all the behaviors in ZK and KRaft are identical.\r\n\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Colin P.

implementation for share-fetch `next-fetch-offset` in share partition and acquiring records from log.\r\n\r\nThe Next Fetch Offset (NFO) determines where the Share Partition should initiate the next data read from the Replica Manager. While it typically aligns with the last offset of the most recently returned batch, last offset + 1, there are exceptions. Messages marked available again due to release acknowledgements or lock timeouts can cause the NFO to shift.\r\n\r\nThe acquire method caches the batches as acquired in-memory and spawns a timer task for lock timeout.\r\n\r\n### Cache\r\n1. `Per-offset Metadata`: Simple to implement but inefficient. Every offset requires in-memory storage and traversal, leading to high memory usage and processing overhead, especially for per-batch acknowledgements (mostly the way records would be acknowledged).\r\n\r\n2. `Per-Replica Fetch Batch`: This approach aligns with the Replica Manager fetch batches. Since a full Replica Manager batch is retrieved whenever the requested offset falls within that batch's boundaries, a single Share Fetch request will likely receive an entire Replica Manager batch. However, there's a trade-off. Replica Manager batches are based on producer batching. If producers don't batch effectively, the in-flight metadata becomes heavily reliant on the producer's batching behavior.\r\n\r\nFor per-message acknowledgements, per-offset tracking will be necessary which again requires splitting in-flight batches based on state. Splitting bacthes is inefficient as it requires cache update wshich maintains sorted order. Therefore, we propose a hybrid approach:\r\n\r\nImplemented a combination of option 2 (per-in-flight batch tracking) with option 1 (per-offset tracking). This aligns well with Replica Manager batching.\r\n\r\nStates shall be maintained per in-flight batch. If state inconsistencies arise within in-flight batches due to per-message acknowledgements, switch state tracking for the respective batch to option 1 (per-offset tracking).\r\n\r\n### Committer

In some rare cases, it's possible that these commits will have already taken place before the tasks are restarted, which causes an assertion failure with the message \"java.lang.AssertionError: Source connector should have published at least one record to new Kafka topic after being reconfigured\".\r\n\r\nThis patch should resolve those failures by establishing the expected number of offset commits _after_ the connector has been reconfigured and its tasks have been restarted, which should guarantee that the offset commits are performed by tasks with the updated connector configuration.\r\n\r\nIn

About\r\nKIP-932 introduces share sessions for share groups. This PR implements share sessions and contexts for incoming share fetch requests on broker. The changes include:\r\n1. Defined `CachedSharePartition` class which are stored in share sessions.\r\n2. Defined `ShareSessionKey`, `ShareSession` classes.\r\n3. Defined `ShareSessionCache` class which caches all the share sessions and has evict policy defined as per KIP-932\r\n4. Defined the 2 types of contexts  - \r\n      a. `ShareSessionContext` - for share session fetch request.\r\n      b. `FinalContext` - for final share fetch request (epoch = -1).\r\n5. Defined `newContext` function which returns the created/updated context on receiving share fetch request on broker.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe added code has been tested with the help of unit tests

(#15834) introduced a change that broke ReassignPartitionsCommandTest.testReassignmentCompletionDuringPartialUpgrade.\r\n\r\nThe point was to validate that the MetadataVersion supports JBOD in KRaft when multiple log directories are configured. We do that by checking the version used in\r\nkafka-features.sh upgrade --metadata, and the version discovered via a FeatureRecord for metadata.version in the cluster metadata.\r\n\r\nThere's no point in checking inter.broker.protocol.version in KafkaConfig, since in KRaft, that configuration is deprecated and ignored — always assuming the value of MINIMUM_KRAFT_VERSION.\r\n\r\nThe broken that was broken sets inter.broker.protocol.version in KRaft mode and configures 3 directories. So alternatively, we could change the test to not configure this property. Since the property isn't forbidden in KRaft mode, just ignored, and operators may forget to remove it, it seems better to remote the fail condition in KafkaConfig.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2024-06-08T06:37:12Z","updated_at":"2024-06-08T11:06:46Z","closed_at":"2024-06-08T11:06:46Z","merged_at":"2024-06-08T11:06:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"5a5a2921462fedde664ec2a61b033240160b66f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16251/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/16251/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/16251/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/7dfd15d1afaf4465e064e3a6950eb2f797805e36","head":{"label":"soarez:m-fix-broken-test","ref":"m-fix-broken-test","sha":"7dfd15d1afaf4465e064e3a6950eb2f797805e36","user":{"login":"soarez","id":1357510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTc1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1357510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez","html_url":"https://github.com/soarez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192427913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTI0Mjc5MTM=","name":"kafka","full_name":"soarez/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"soarez","id":1357510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNTc1MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1357510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez","html_url":"https://github.com/soarez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/soarez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/soarez/kafka","description":"Mirror
