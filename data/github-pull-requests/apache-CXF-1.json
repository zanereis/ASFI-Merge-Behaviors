noteworthy</h3>\n<h4>🚀 New: Java 24 Support</h4>\n<p>This release of PMD brings support for Java 24. There are no new standard language features,\nbut a couple of preview language features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/488\">JEP 488: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Second Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/492\">JEP 492: Flexible Constructor Bodies (Third Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/494\">JEP 494: Module Import Declarations (Second Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/495\">JEP 495: Simple Source Files and Instance Main Methods (Fourth Preview)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these preview language features,\nyou'll need to enable it via the environment variable <code>PMD_JAVA_OPTS</code> and select the new language\nversion <code>24-preview</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview\npmd check --use-version java-24-preview ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Support for Java 22 preview language features have been removed. The version &quot;22-preview&quot;\nis no longer available.</p>\n<h4>New GPG Release Signing Key</h4>\n<p>Since January 2025, we switched the GPG Key we use for signing releases in Maven Central to be\n<a href=\"https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x2EFA55D0785C31F956F2F87EA0B5CA1A4E086838&amp;fingerprint=on&amp;op=index\">A0B5CA1A4E086838</a>.\nThe full fingerprint is <code>2EFA 55D0 785C 31F9 56F2  F87E A0B5 CA1A 4E08 6838</code>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

noteworthy</h3>\n<h4>🚀 New: Java 24 Support</h4>\n<p>This release of PMD brings support for Java 24. There are no new standard language features,\nbut a couple of preview language features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/488\">JEP 488: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Second Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/492\">JEP 492: Flexible Constructor Bodies (Third Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/494\">JEP 494: Module Import Declarations (Second Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/495\">JEP 495: Simple Source Files and Instance Main Methods (Fourth Preview)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these preview language features,\nyou'll need to enable it via the environment variable <code>PMD_JAVA_OPTS</code> and select the new language\nversion <code>24-preview</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview\npmd check --use-version java-24-preview ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Support for Java 22 preview language features have been removed. The version &quot;22-preview&quot;\nis no longer available.</p>\n<h4>New GPG Release Signing Key</h4>\n<p>Since January 2025, we switched the GPG Key we use for signing releases in Maven Central to be\n<a href=\"https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?search=0x2EFA55D0785C31F956F2F87EA0B5CA1A4E086838&amp;fingerprint=on&amp;op=index\">A0B5CA1A4E086838</a>.\nThe full fingerprint is <code>2EFA 55D0 785C 31F9 56F2  F87E A0B5 CA1A 4E08 6838</code>.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

noteworthy</h3>\n<h4>🚀 New: Java 24 Support</h4>\n<p>This release of PMD brings support for Java 24.

[org.mozilla:rhino](https://github.com/mozilla/rhino) from 1.7.15 to 1.8.0.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/releases\">org.mozilla:rhino's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Rhino 1.8.0</h2>\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n<p>Rhino 1.8.0 contains some significant changes, so we're incrementing the final version number for the first time in a very long time. Here are a few highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rhino now requires Java 11 minimum. We currently test against Java 11, 17, and 21.</li>\n<li>Rhino has been broken down into individual Java modules that are properly encapsulated as Java Modules. See <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/blob/master/README.md\">README.md</a> for a breakdown of which modules are which -- short answer is that everyone will need the &quot;rhino&quot; module and many will need others.</li>\n<li>Older code not able to adapt to using multiple JARS can still use the &quot;rhino-all&quot; module, which publishes an &quot;all-in-one&quot; JAR like the old &quot;rhino.jar&quot;.</li>\n<li>The default language level is &quot;VERSION_ES6&quot;. That means that modern JavaScript features supported by Rhino will work by default.</li>\n<li>There are big improvements in compatibility, including support for &quot;super&quot;, reflect and proxy, and lots of other language features.

Here are a few highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rhino now requires Java 11 minimum. We currently test against Java 11, 17, and 21.</li>\n<li>Rhino has been broken down into individual Java modules that are properly encapsulated as Java Modules. See <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/rhino/blob/master/README.md\">README.md</a> for a breakdown of which modules are which -- short answer is that everyone will need the &quot;rhino&quot; module and many will need others.</li>\n<li>Older code not able to adapt to using multiple JARS can still use the &quot;rhino-all&quot; module, which publishes an &quot;all-in-one&quot; JAR like the old &quot;rhino.jar&quot;.</li>\n<li>The default language level is &quot;VERSION_ES6&quot;. That means that modern JavaScript features supported by Rhino will work by default.</li>\n<li>There are big improvements in compatibility, including support for &quot;super&quot;, reflect and proxy, and lots of other language features. See the <a href=\"https://mozilla.github.io/rhino/compat/engines.html\">compatibility table</a> for the details.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to all who contributed -- we had 24 contributors to this release, with some new contributors who added significant capabilities.

href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases\">com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java 7.0.2</h2>\n<p>We have just released version 7.0.2 of the <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk\">UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</a>. It is available for download from <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/files/\">SourceForge</a>, and it is available in the <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.unboundid/unboundid-ldapsdk/7.0.2\">Maven Central Repository</a>. You can find the release notes for this release (and all previous versions) at <a href=\"https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html\">https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html</a>, but here’s a summary of the changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We added support for using the 2.x version of the Bouncy Castle FIPS-compliant security provider, which provides support for FIPS 140-3 compliance. The 1.x version of the library, offering FIPS 140-2 compliance, is still supported. To use the LDAP SDK in this mode, you should ensure that the necessary jar files are in the classpath, and then you should call <code>CryptoHelper.setUseFIPSMode(&quot;BCFIPS2&quot;)</code> as early as possible in the life of the application.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>PropertyManager</code> class that can be used to retrieve the value of specified properties using either system properties or environment variables. Values can be optionally parsed as Booleans, numbers, or comma-delimited lists. Most uses of system properties within the LDAP SDK have been updated to support the new <code>PropertyManager</code> mechanism so that it’s possible to set values as environment variables as an alternative to system properties.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We fixed a bug in the <code>SSLUtil.certificateToString</code> method that prevented it from including the notBefore and notAfter timestamps in the string representation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added client-side support for the Ping Identity Directory Server’s new to-be-deleted accessibility state for use with the get subtree accessibility and set subtree accessibility extended operations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the <code>MoveSubtree</code> utility class to provide the ability to use the new to-be-deleted accessibility state (as an alternative to the hidden state) for the target subtree before starting to remove entries from the source server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>SubtreeAccessibilityState.isMoreRestrictiveThan</code> method that can be used to determine whether one accessibility state is considered more restrictive than another.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updated the documentation to include the latest versions of the following LDAP-related specifications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>draft-coretta-ldap-subnf-01</li>\n<li>draft-coretta-oiddir-radit</li>\n<li>draft-coretta-oiddir-radsa</li>\n<li>draft-coretta-oiddir-radua</li>\n<li>draft-coretta-oiddir-roadmap</li>\n<li>draft-coretta-oiddir-schema</li>\n<li>draft-ietf-kitten-scram-2fa</li>\n<li>draft-melnikov-sasl2</li>\n<li>draft-melnikov-scram-bis</li>\n<li>draft-melnikov-scram-sha-512</li>\n<li>draft-melnikov-scram-sha3-512</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/blob/master/docs/release-notes.html\">com.unboundid:unboundid-ldapsdk's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>          &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>${TARGET=&quot;offline&quot;}                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LDAP SDK Home Page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n${TARGET=&quot;offline&quot;}                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Product Information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<pre><code>          &lt;h2&gt;Release Notes&lt;/h2&gt;\n<pre><code>      &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Version 7.0.2&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;\n\n      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n        The following changes were made between the 7.0.1 and 7.0.2 releases:\n      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n      &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Added support for using the 2.x version of the Bouncy Castle FIPS-compliant\n          security provider, which offers support for FIPS 140-3 compliance.
