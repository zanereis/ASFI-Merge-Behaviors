Gobblin on it's own works pretty well but at a couple of place it assumes the underlying fs is consistent which is not true in some case like in some S3 region.\r\nTo overcome this I added a couple of retry if the created dir/file fails to exist right away after publish.\r\nThe following changes were added:\r\n- Refactored RetryWriter to gobblin-core to be able use in WriterUtils and not having circular dependencies.\r\n- Introducing mkdirsWithRecursivePermissionWithRetry to be able set retry if directory does not exists right after creation on eventual consistent fs.\r\n- Adding retry to publisher (data.publisher.retry.enabled=true) like TimestampDataPublisher, TimePartitinedDataPublisher to support eventual consisteny filesystem targets\r\n- Tmp fs can be specified with compaction.tmp.fs in compaction job to be able use hdfs for tmp fs and store result on S3. Earlier it was not possible to use differnet fs for tmp and target.\r\n- Retry can be set for compaction if you don't want to fail right away if directory fails to show up right away which can happen on eventual consistent fs (compaction.retry.enabled=true)\r\n- Adding dataset name for compaction mr job name which makes significantly easier to identify which compaction job belongs to which dataset.\r\n- Some minor modification to support non avro

PR changes the way Tasks are executed to a push model using Reactivex (http://reactivex.io/).\r\n\r\nMain changes:\r\n* Task no longer handles records, instead it handles a record stream containing a Reactivex `Flowable` along with metadata.\r\n* Constructs modified to handle the stream instead of individual records:\r\n  * Extractor: Main point of interaction is `recordStream` method. By default, create a stream that repeatedly calls `readRecord`.\r\n  * Converter / Quality checker: Main point of interaction is `processStream` method. By default, map records using `convertRecord` and `executePolicies`.\r\n  * Writer: minimal changes, mostly around `RecordEnvelope` explained later.\r\n* Forks work a little different. A `Forker` takes a `ForkOperator` and splits the record stream into multiple record streams. Then, we call `Fork.consumeRecordStream` for each such mirrored stream.\r\n* All records are wrapped in `RecordEnvelope` (introduced previously). This is a first step to more closely unify batch and streaming. There's nothing special about `RecordEnvelope`, everything works transparently, except metrics get a little
