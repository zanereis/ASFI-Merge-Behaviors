SUMMARY\r\nThe welcome page submenu currently does not use the same `SubMenu` component that's used on the other routes, like Dashboard, Chart, Dataset etc, causing it to deviate from the normal look and feel. This fixes that. At the same time I noticed that we were using a re-export of `FeatureFlag` from `@superset-ui/core` in lots of places, which I believe is a remnant from the multirepo days. This removes the export and replaces all occurences with a direct import from `@superset-ui/core`.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nNow the Welcome page looks the same as the other pages:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/213676077-9af1a80f-8835-4fe7-ad84-456c4fc44296.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nPreviously the \"Home\" text had a different font size, and the text next to the toggle was not using the proper theme.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/213676247-69d26e48-6440-4462-b293-8791a78128a7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

oversight, but https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/21794 neglected to account that Hive doesn't use the `information_schema` construct and relies on `SHOW VIEWS` and `SHOW TABLES` to obtain the names of views and table (which somewhat ironically includes views).\r\n\r\nThis PR remedies said regression by adding the HiveEngineSpec.get_view_names` method.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe the change

SUMMARY\r\nSmall fix to handle null values for context params for databricks. This error happens for example in sql lab when a bad query is written and the error is parsed. The error just says \"hostname\" when that's not the root cause of the issue. Note that databricks doesn't currently have any custom error messages.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nFixes #22715\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `WTF_` CSRF-related overrides from the configuration file generated by the Helm chart, allowing the defaults from `config.py` to be used.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/blob/2ccdb72830ffb549c0112442ba0bc7e4219261d4/superset/config.py#L249-L257\r\n\r\nAs noted in #22715, there may be better ways to handle the CSRF exclusion for these three routes outside of the config file to prevent this same mistake from being made in other context. This is just the simplest solution that solves the issue with the Helm chart clearing the list.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Deploy a copy of Superset using the Helm chart\r\n2. Navigate around the UI\r\n3. Confirm that calls to `/superset/log` are returning 200 instead of 302 redirects to `/login`\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include

to provide some more clarity around the CSP requirements and to add a basic example `TALISMAN_CONFIG`.\r\n\r\nI've been submitting docs updates for issues I hit during an initial deployment of Superset on Kubernetes. Upon deployment, I started seeing CSP warnings from the `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_WARNING` setting in my logs, but the docs did not provide much information about what sort of CSP Superset requires in order to function.\r\n\r\nI first tried a basic strict CSP of `default-src: 'self'; object-src: 'none'`. This resulted Superset's UI failing to run with a number of errors related to `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`. Adding those keywords to the basic policy allowed Superset's UI to operate in our deployment.\r\n\r\n* Does this capture all the necessary requirements for Superset's CSP? Are there other considerations that should be highlighted?\r\n* Is there any reason to break out individual CSP sections like `script-src` and `style-src` vs using `default-src` in the example? I'd favor simplicity as a starting point if there's no compelling reason to break them out.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nRead the new docs. \r\n\r\n* Does this seem like a reasonable description of the CSP requirements? \r\n* Is the example given a reasonable default configuration?\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

during SSR stringification for hydration. You should always ensure your <code>loader</code>/<code>action</code> returns a value, and you may return <code>null</code> if you don't wish to return anything.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR fixes Explore's dataset control so it correctly displays the intended UI when the chart's dataset doesn't exist or Explore has been opened without a specified chart or dataset.\r\n\r\nPrior to moving Explore into the SPA, `DatasourceControl` (the dataset picker in the upper left) would check for a dataset ID of `null` to determine if the current chart's dataset existed.  As part of moving Explore into the SPA, the initial Explore state in Redux was set to [this object](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/539936522fbbda46ebb39b65ed298f6e251a548f/superset-frontend/src/explore/fixtures.tsx#L146), which has the dataset ID set to `0`.  When a user opens Explore for a chart whose dataset does not exist, or when Explore is opened without a specified chart (this happens for new charts) and also without a dataset specified (this should only happen by accident), the initial Explore state's dataset object is not overwritten.  Because `DatasourceControl` is checking for an ID of `null`, it doesn't correctly identify these cases as empty dataset situations, and shows options that should only be present in situations when there is a dataset and don't work correctly when no dataset is present.\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n- Makes Explore check for a dataset ID of 0, so the empty dataset alerts that were already present in code appear again\r\n- Hides the \"Edit Dataset\" and \"View in SQL Lab\" menu items, which don't work without a dataset\r\n- Makes the \"missing dataset\" text translated and a little more human-readable\r\n- Adds tests\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nChart with missing dataset, before:\r\n![localhost_9000_explore__slice_id=152 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/211907567-22027b54-112e-421a-b0a3-7dc161ee67a8.png)\r\n\r\nChart with missing dataset, after:\r\n![localhost_9000_explore__slice_id=152 (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/211907653-c9ac7e27-218c-4430-b670-01a2cd3a9329.png)\r\n\r\nNo chart with no dataset specified (e.g. from visiting `/explore` with no query string), before:\r\n![localhost_9000_explore_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/211907582-54084b82-c8c3-47a4-ae79-f93e7c6feb80.png)\r\n\r\nNo chart with no dataset specified, after:\r\n![localhost_9000_explore_ (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13007381/211907630-0ae991bb-6992-4f7c-b3c0-4953c9b3159e.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n- Create and save a chart based on a dataset, then delete that dataset.  Open that chart again and confirm that the correct message (dataset was deleted) appears under `DatasourceControl` and that the only menu option in the `DatasourceControl` three-dots menu is \"Swap dataset\".\r\n- Check that swapping the dataset via button or via menu item makes the message disappear and allows for chart editing/saving.\r\n- Visit `/explore` and confirm that the correct message (missing URL params) appears under `DatasourceControl` and that the only menu option in the `DatasourceControl` three-dots menu is \"Swap dataset\".\r\n- Check that swapping the dataset via menu item makes the message disappear and allows for chart editing/saving.\r\n- Check that creating charts from the Add Chart page works the same as before.\r\n- Check that editing existing charts with existing datasets works the same as before.\r\n- Check that creating charts from a SQL Lab query works the same, before and after saving the dataset.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any

documentation. This PR attempts to reorder and rewrite existing caching documentation for improved clarity. \r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n* Being more explicit about the required dictionary format for cache configuration and adding a simple redis example.\r\n* Splitting `RESULTS_BACKEND` into its own section and clarifying that it is _not_ configured using a flask-caching dictionary.\r\n* Adding a header to call out the additional python dependencies needed for for redis and memcache.\r\n* Breaking out information on the fallback `SupersetMetastoreCache` into its own section.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nRead the new docs! Do the accurately describe cache configuration in a clear manner?\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nCurrently the documentation text and icon config parameters are not being respected in the `RightMenu` component. See the parameters here: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/c0aeb2a75a06694402be0f15d1eb64631d3b9ef9/superset/config.py#L1307-L1310\r\n\r\nThis fixes that + adds similar overrides for the bug links.

Please see notes below as to why this change was made.</li>\n<li>Updates repository maintainership information</li>\n<li>Updates the copyright (no license terms change has been made)</li>\n<li>Removes accidental epizeuxis (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/debug-js/debug/issues/828\">#828</a>)</li>\n<li>Adds README section regarding usage in child procs (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/debug-js/debug/issues/850\">#850</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thank you to <a href=\"https://github.com/taylor1791\"><code>@‚Äãtaylor1791</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/kristofkalocsai\"><code>@‚Äãkristofkalocsai</code></a> for their contributions.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Repository Migration Information</h1>\n<p>I've formatted this as a FAQ, please feel free to open an issue for any additional question and I'll add the response here.</p>\n<h3>Q: What impact will this have on me?</h3>\n<p>In most cases, you shouldn't notice any change.</p>\n<p>The only exception I can think of is if you pull code directly from <a href=\"https://github.com/visionmedia/debug\">https://github.com/visionmedia/debug</a>, e.g. via a <code>&quot;debug&quot;: &quot;visionmedia/debug&quot;</code>-type version entry in your package.json - in which case, you should <em>still</em> be fine due to the automatic redirection Github sets up, but you should also update any references as soon as possible.</p>\n<h3>Q: What are the security implications of this change?</h3>\n<p>If you pull code directly from the old URL, you should update the URL to <a href=\"https://github.com/debug-js/debug\">https://github.com/debug-js/debug</a> as soon as possible. The old organization has <em>many</em> approved owners and thus a new repository could (in theory) be created at the old URL, circumventing Github's automatic redirect that is in place now and serving malicious code. I (<a href=\"https://github.com/qix\"><code>@‚Äãqix</code></a>-) also wouldn't have access to that repository, so while I don't think it would happen, it's still something to consider.</p>\n<p>Even in such a case, however, the officially released package on npm (<code>debug</code>) would <em>not</em> be affected. That package is still very much under control (even more than it used to be).</p>\n<h3>Q: What should I do if I encounter an issue related to the migration?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/debug-js/debug/issues?q=label%3Amigration+\">Search the issues first</a> to see if someone has already reported it, and <em>then</em> open a new issue if someone has not.</p>\n<h3>Q: Why was this done as a 'patch' release? Isn't this breaking?</h3>\n<p>No, it shouldn't be breaking. The package on npm shouldn't be affected (aside from this patch release) and any references to the old repository should automatically redirect.</p>\n<p>Thus, according to all of the &quot;APIs&quot; (loosely put) involved, nothing should have broken.</p>\n<p>I understand there are a lot of edge cases so please open issues as needed so I can assist in any way necessary.</p>\n<h3>Q: Why was the repository transferred?</h3>\n<p>I'll just list them off in no particular order.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The old organization was defunct and abandoned.</li>\n<li>I was not an owner of the old organization and thus could not ban the non-trivial amount of spam users or the few truly abusive users from the org.

SUMMARY\r\nThe databricks connector driver will error if there's a space in the http_path. Fixing this at the db engine spec level to catch at the lowest level. The ui for the database connection modal already strips on the client side, so adding an extra layer here for api handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCurl the api with a trailing string in the http_path field for either validate/edit/or db connection. The connection should work regardless of any leading/trailing whitespace. \r\n\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\"

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n1. For dashboards with long title all elements don't fit to screen anymore and horizontal scrolling appears. This PR is an attempt to solve this issue.\r\n2. I suggest to show not 1 but 2 lines of the title if it is long enough (which is a common practice in my company). The overflow will be hidden as it was before. It is done with the help of CSS properties webkit-line-clamp and webkit-box-orient (example [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/-webkit-line-clamp)). Moreover, it is looks so much better on smartphone.\r\n\r\nIt works as expected in Chrome and Firefox, I did not check the behavior in other browsers.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53895552/211524027-d9ddeffc-122f-436f-bc0e-123aebbfc3e4.png)\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53895552/211524084-d8dde391-c961-4888-8c89-2df559c8d32a.png)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE vs AFTER video (with sound)\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53895552/211523820-fe913c9f-d387-450c-ada0-72a1ba7572ee.mp4\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n#21018 and #21439 added memoization of common bootstrap data to avoid repetitive calls to regenerate user perms in bootstrap data. However, this had the side-effect of also using cached toasts, causing toasts to either 1) not display 2) display with a lag and not clear.\r\n\r\nThis breaks out the expensive logic from `common_bootstrap_payload` into a separate function `cached_common_bootstrap_data` which is memoized, and always checks flashed messages to ensure that they always accurately reflect the current toasts.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

This PR adds runtime safety checks in the code to avoid runtime errors in cases where we can safely ignore and id that does not return a component and other cases that could throw an uncaught error disrupting recursion and putting application in failure state.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5614266/211370873-1439712b-31d9-42c9-a092-2aa2d0da0668.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5614266/211372856-2c7a826e-f0d6-4351-ae7d-f15ce3c78876.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nThis is a fix that does not have easily reproducible steps, but new added unit tests can create the error case seen in production system and verify these changes address the issue.\r\n\r\nGeneral testing should be done around creating, editing, and deleting dashboard filters and behavior should work as it did before these changes, no new errors should be present\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ]
