What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to stop `ReceiverTracker` to close `WriteAheadLog` whenever it is and make `WriteAheadLog` and its implementations idempotent.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test in `WriteAheadLogSuite`. Note that  the added test looks passing even if it closes twice (namely even without the changes in `FileBasedWriteAheadLog` and `BatchedWriteAheadLog`. It looks both are already idempotent but this is a rather sanity check.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current code, chunks are fetched from shuffle service in two steps:\r\nStep-1. Send `OpenBlocks`, which contains the blocks list to to fetch;\r\nStep-2. Fetch the consecutive chunks from shuffle-service by `streamId` and `chunkIndex`\r\nConceptually, there is no need to send the blocks list in step-1. Client can send the blockId in Step-2. Receiving `ChunkFetchRequest`, server can check if the chunkId is in local block manager and send back response. \r\nThus memory cost can be

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds support for [Nomad](https://github.com/hashicorp/nomad) as a scheduler backend. Nomad is a cluster manager designed for both long lived services and short lived batch processing workloads.\r\n\r\nThe integration supports client and cluster mode, dynamic allocation (increasing only), has basic support for python and R applications, and works with applications packaged either as JARs or as docker images.\r\n\r\nDocumentation is in [docs/running-on-nomad.md](https://github.com/barnardb/spark/blob/nomad/docs/running-on-nomad.md).\r\n\r\nThis will be [presented at Spark Summit 2017](https://spark-summit.org/2017/events/homologous-apache-spark-clusters-using-nomad/).\r\n\r\nA build of the pull request with Nomad support is at available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/llcv388yl5hweje/spark-2.3.0-SNAPSHOT-bin-nomad.tgz?dl=0).\r\n\r\nFeedback would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch was tested

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds RateSource for Structured Streaming so that the user can use it to generate data for tests and benchmark easily.\r\n\r\nThis source generates increment long values with timestamps. Each generated row has two columns: a timestamp column for the generated time and an auto increment long column starting with 0L.\r\n\r\nIt supports the following options:\r\n- `rowsPerSecond` (e.g. 100, default: 1): How many rows should be generated per second.\r\n- `rampUpTime` (e.g. 5s, default: 0s): How long to ramp up before the generating speed becomes `rowsPerSecond`. Using finer granularities than seconds will be truncated to integer seconds. \r\n- `numPartitions` (e.g. 10, default: Spark's default parallelism): The partition number for the generated rows. The source will try its best to reach `rowsPerSecond`, but the query may be resource constrained, and `numPartitions` can be tweaked to help reach the desired speed.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example that prints 10 rows per seconds:\r\n```\r\n    spark.readStream\r\n      .format(\"rate\")\r\n      .option(\"rowsPerSecond\", \"10\")\r\n      .load()\r\n      .writeStream\r\n      .format(\"console\")\r\n      .start()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea came from @marmbrus and he did the initial work.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPreviously, `RDD.treeAggregate` used `reduceByKey` and `reduce` in its implementation, neither of which technically allows the `seq`/`combOps` to modify and return their first arguments.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses `foldByKey` and `fold` instead and notes that `aggregate` and `treeAggregate` are semantically identical in the Scala doc.\r\n\r\nNote that this had some test failures by unknown reasons. This was actually fixed in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/e3554605b36bdce63ac180cc66dbdee5c1528ec7.\r\n\r\nThe root cause was, the `zeroValue` now becomes `AFTAggregator` and it compares `totalCnt` (where the value is actually 0). It starts merging one by one and it keeps returning `this` where `totalCnt` is 0. So, this looks not the bug in the current change.\r\n\r\nThis is now fixed in the commit. So, this should pass the tests.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest case added in `RDDSuite`.\r\n\r\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently if some partitions of a partitioned table are used in join operation we rely on Metastore returned size of table to calculate if we can convert the operation to Broadcast join. \r\nif Filter can prune some partitions, Hive can prune partition before determining to use broadcast joins according to HDFS size of partitions that are involved in Query.So sparkSQL needs it that can improve join's performance for partitioned table.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nadd unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-04T07:04:21Z","updated_at":"2020-01-18T00:08:08Z","closed_at":"2020-01-18T00:08:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"874d41db2f2ca199015b4374868aeb60d03ea386","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/72f63fafbe23d31e831edfc9ca832c5d62aefde1","head":{"label":"lianhuiwang:partition_broadcast_2","ref":"partition_broadcast_2","sha":"72f63fafbe23d31e831edfc9ca832c5d62aefde1","user":{"login":"lianhuiwang","id":545478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTQ3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang","html_url":"https://github.com/lianhuiwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20906966,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDkwNjk2Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"lianhuiwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lianhuiwang","id":545478,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NTQ3OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/545478?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang","html_url":"https://github.com/lianhuiwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianhuiwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lianhuiwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n There exists three `ShuffleWriter ` implementations, we first use the helper method `SortShuffleWriter#shouldBypassMergeSort` to determine whether a shuffle should use `BypassMergeSort` path，and then use another helper method `SortShuffleManager#canUseSerializedShuffle` for deciding `UnsafeShuffleWriter` path. From view of code structure consistency，method `shouldBypassMergeSort` should not belong to `SortShuffleWriter`，it should be included in `BypassMergeSortShuffleWriter` or `SortShuffleManager`, and better for the later one to put the two helper methods together. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`HintInfo.isBroadcastable` is actually not an accurate name, it's used to force the planner to broadcast a plan no matter what the data size is, via the hint mechanism. I think `forceBroadcast` is a better name.\r\n\r\nAnd `isBroadcastable` only have 2 possible values: `Some(true)` and `None`, so we can just use boolean type for it.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`SharedState.externalCatalog` is marked as a `lazy val` but actually it's not lazy. We access `externalCatalog` while initializing `SharedState` and thus eliminate the effort of `lazy val`. When creating `ExternalCatalog` we will try to connect to the metastore and may throw an error, so it makes sense to make it a `lazy val` in `SharedState`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn [this line](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/f7cf2096fdecb8edab61c8973c07c6fc877ee32d/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/CoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend.scala#L128), it uses the `executorId` string received from executors and finally it will go into `TaskUIData`. As deserializing the `executorId` string will always create a new instance, we have a lot of duplicated string instances.\r\n\r\nThis PR does a String interning for TaskUIData to reduce the memory usage.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test using `bin/spark-shell --master local-cluster[6,1,1024]`. Test codes:\r\n```\r\nfor (_ <- 1 to 10) { sc.makeRDD(1 to 1000, 1000).count() }\r\nThread.sleep(2000)\r\nval l = sc.getClass.getMethod(\"jobProgressListener\").invoke(sc).asInstanceOf[org.apache.spark.ui.jobs.JobProgressListener]\r\norg.apache.spark.util.SizeEstimator.estimate(l.stageIdToData)\r\n```\r\nThis PR reduces the size of `stageIdToData` from 3487280 to 3009744 (86.3%) in the above

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nBefore this PR, Subquery reuse does not work. Below are three issues:\r\n- Subquery reuse does not work.  \r\n- It is sharing the same `SQLConf` (`spark.sql.exchange.reuse`) with the one for Exchange Reuse. \r\n- No test case covers the rule Subquery reuse. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix the above three issues. \r\n- Ignored the physical operator `SubqueryExec` when comparing two plans. \r\n- Added a dedicated conf `spark.sql.subqueries.reuse` for controlling Subquery Reuse\r\n- Added a test case for verifying the behavior\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`IllegalAccessError` is a fatal error (a subclass of LinkageError) and its meaning is `Thrown if an application attempts to access or modify a field, or to call a method that it does not have access to`. Throwing a fatal error for AccumulatorV2 is not necessary and is pretty bad because it usually will just kill executors or SparkContext ([SPARK-20666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20666) is an example of killing SparkContext due to `IllegalAccessError`). I think the correct type of exception in AccumulatorV2 should be `IllegalStateException`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTurn tracking of TaskMetrics._updatedBlockStatuses off by default. As far as I can see its not used by anything and it uses a lot of memory when caching and processing a lot of blocks.  In my case it was taking 5GB of a 10GB heap and I even went up to 50GB heap and the job still ran out of memory.  With this change in place the same job easily runs in less then 10GB of heap.\r\n\r\nWe leave the api there as well as a config to turn it back on just in case anyone is using it.  TaskMetrics is exposed via SparkListenerTaskEnd so if users are relying on it they can turn it back on.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan unit tests that were modified and manually tested on a couple of jobs (with and without caching).  Clicked through the UI and didn't see anything missing. \r\nRan my very large hive query job with 200,000 small tasks, 1000 executors, cached 6+TB of data this runs fine now whereas without this change it would go into full gcs and eventually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, if we run `./python/run-tests.py` and they are aborted without cleaning up this directory, it fails pep8 check due to some Python scripts generated. For example, https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/7387126f83dc0489eb1df734bfeba705709b7861/python/pyspark/tests.py#L1955-L1968\r\n\r\n```\r\nPEP8 checks failed.\r\n./work/app-20170531190857-0000/0/test.py:5:55: W292 no newline at end of file\r\n./work/app-20170531190909-0000/0/test.py:5:55: W292 no newline at end of file\r\n./work/app-20170531190924-0000/0/test.py:3:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1\r\n./work/app-20170531190924-0000/0/test.py:7:52: W292 no newline at end of file\r\n./work/app-20170531191016-0000/0/test.py:5:55: W292 no newline at end of file\r\n./work/app-20170531191030-0000/0/test.py:5:55: W292 no newline at end of file\r\n./work/app-20170531191045-0000/0/test.py:3:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1\r\n./work/app-20170531191045-0000/0/test.py:7:52: W292 no newline at end of file\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor me, it is sometimes a bit annoying. This PR proposes to exclude these (assuming we want to skip per https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/.gitignore#L73).\r\n\r\nAlso, it moves other pep8 configurations in the script into ini configuration file in pep8.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested via

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nActual pushed-down catalyst predicate expressions look not being represented correctly (but only sources filters). For example, the below case\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndf.filter(\"cast(a as string) == '1' and a < 3\").explain()\r\n```\r\n\r\nprints the plan as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*Filter (cast(a#0L as string) = 1)\r\n+- *Scan SimpleCatalystScan(0,10) [a#0L] PushedFilters: [*LessThan(a,3)], ReadSchema: struct<a:bigint>\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual pushed predicates via `buildScan(requiredColumns: Seq[Attribute], filters: Seq[Expression])` are as below:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nprintln(filters.mkString(\"[\", \", \", \"]\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n[(cast(a#0L as string) =

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRight now in the UI, after SPARK-20213, we can show the operations to write data out. However, there is no way to associate metrics with data writes. We should show relative metrics on the operations.\r\n\r\n#### Supported commands\r\n\r\nThis change supports updating metrics for file-based data writing operations, including `InsertIntoHadoopFsRelationCommand`, `InsertIntoHiveTable`.\r\n\r\nSupported metrics:\r\n\r\n* number of written files\r\n* number of dynamic partitions\r\n* total bytes of written data\r\n* total number of output rows\r\n* average writing data out time (ms)\r\n* (TODO) min/med/max number of output rows per file/partition\r\n* (TODO) min/med/max bytes of written data per file/partition\r\n\r\n####  Commands not supported\r\n\r\n`InsertIntoDataSourceCommand`, `SaveIntoDataSourceCommand`:\r\n\r\nThe two commands uses DataSource APIs to write data out, i.e., the logic of writing data out is delegated to the DataSource implementations, such as  `InsertableRelation.insert` and `CreatableRelationProvider.createRelation`. So we can't obtain metrics from delegated methods for now.\r\n\r\n`CreateHiveTableAsSelectCommand`, `CreateDataSourceTableAsSelectCommand` : \r\n\r\nThe two commands invokes other commands to write data out. The invoked commands can even write to non file-based data source. We leave them as future TODO.\r\n\r\n#### How to update metrics of writing files out\r\n\r\nA `RunnableCommand` which wants to update metrics, needs to override its `metrics` and provide the metrics data structure to `ExecutedCommandExec`.\r\n\r\nThe metrics are prepared during the execution of `FileFormatWriter`. The callback function passed to `FileFormatWriter` will accept the metrics and update accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere is a metrics updating function in `RunnableCommand`. In runtime, the function will be bound to the spark context and `metrics` of `ExecutedCommandExec` and pass to `FileFormatWriter`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1.  add `assert(resolve(before) === after)` to check before and after in test of resolveURI.\r\nthe function `assertResolves(before: String, after: String)` have two params, it means we should check the before value whether equals the after value which we want.\r\ne.g. the after value of Utils.resolveURI(\"hdfs:///root/spark.jar#app.jar\").toString should be \"hdfs:///root/spark.jar#app.jar\" rather than \"hdfs:/root/spark.jar#app.jar\". we need `assert(resolve(before) === after)` to make it more safe.\r\n2. identify the cases between resolveURI and resolveURIs.\r\n3. delete duplicate cases and some small fix make this suit more clear.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nunit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we detect fetch failure, we only remove the shuffle files produced by the executor, while the host itself might be down and all the shuffle files are not accessible. In case we are running multiple executors on a host, any host going down currently results in multiple fetch failures and multiple retries of the stage, which is very inefficient. If we remove all the shuffle files on that host, on first fetch failure, we can rerun all the tasks on that host in a single stage retry.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit testing and also ran a job on the cluster and made sure multiple retries are gone.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-30T22:26:21Z","updated_at":"2017-06-14T03:37:04Z","closed_at":"2017-06-14T03:37:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9383fbd5b871a56cfcb2eb8d392fb6f41c59ca63","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18150/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/18150/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/18150/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ba2ca2adfe15977fe48ccc97b282e97381135f67","head":{"label":"sitalkedia:cleanup_shuffle","ref":"cleanup_shuffle","sha":"ba2ca2adfe15977fe48ccc97b282e97381135f67","user":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":51496876,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MTQ5Njg3Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"sitalkedia/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sitalkedia","id":11507549,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTA3NTQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11507549?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia","html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sitalkedia/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sitalkedia/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the user runs a Structured Streaming query in a cluster, if the driver uses the local file system, StateStore running in executors will throw a file-not-found exception. However, the current error is not obvious.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes StreamExecution resolve the path in driver and uses the full path including the scheme part (such as `hdfs:/`, `file:/`) in StateStore.\r\n\r\nThen if the above error happens, StateStore will throw an error with this full path which starts with `file:/`, and it makes this error obvious: the checkpoint location is on the local file system.\r\n\r\nOne potential minor issue is that the user cannot use different default file system settings in driver and executors (e.g., use a public HDFS address in driver and a private HDFS address in executors) after this change. However, since the batch query also has this issue (See https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/4bb6a53ebd06de3de97139a2dbc7c85fc3aa3e66/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSource.scala#L402), it doesn't make things worse.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nExplicitly handle the FetchFailedException in FileFormatWriter, so it does not get wrapped.\r\n\r\nNote that this is no longer strictly necessary after SPARK-19276, but it improves error messages and also will help avoid others stumbling across this in the future.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unit

can't handle dates from 1899-100, according to the documentation by design. `calendar.timegm` is equivalent in shared cases, but can handle those years.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `time.mktime` for the more able `calendar.timegm` to adress cases like:\r\n```python\r\nimport datetime as dt\r\nsqlContext.createDataFrame(sc.parallelize([[dt.datetime(1899,12,31)]])).count()\r\n```\r\nfailing due to internal conversion failure when there is no timezone information in the time object. In the case there is information, `calendar` was used instead.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing test cases cover this change, since it does not change any existing functionality. Added a test to confirm it working in the problematic range.\r\n\r\nThis PR is original work from me and I license this work to the Spark

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe issue of SPARK-6628 is:\r\n```\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HiveHBaseTableOutputFormat \r\n```\r\ncannot be cast to\r\n```\r\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.HiveOutputFormat\r\n```\r\nThe reason is:\r\n```\r\npublic interface HiveOutputFormat<K, V> extends OutputFormat<K, V> {…}\r\n\r\npublic class HiveHBaseTableOutputFormat extends\r\n    TableOutputFormat<ImmutableBytesWritable> implements\r\n    OutputFormat<ImmutableBytesWritable, Object> {...}\r\n```\r\nFrom the two snippets above, we can see both `HiveHBaseTableOutputFormat` and `HiveOutputFormat` `extends`/`implements` `OutputFormat`, and can not cast to each other. \r\n\r\nFor Spark 1.6, 2.0, 2.1, Spark initials the `outputFormat` in `SparkHiveWriterContainer`. For Spark 2.2+,  Spark initials the `outputFormat` in `HiveFileFormat`.\r\n```\r\n@transient private lazy val outputFormat =\r\n        jobConf.value.getOutputFormat.asInstanceOf[HiveOutputFormat[AnyRef, Writable]]\r\n```\r\n`outputFormat` above has to be  `HiveOutputFormat`. However, when users insert data into hbase, the outputFormat is `HiveHBaseTableOutputFormat`, it isn't instance of `HiveOutputFormat`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to make `outputFormat` to be \"null\" when the `OutputFormat` is not an instance of `HiveOutputFormat`. This change should be safe since `outputFormat` is only used to get the file extension in function [`getFileExtension()`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/branch-2.1/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/hiveWriterContainers.scala#L101). \r\n\r\nWe can also submit this PR to Master branch.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually test.\r\n(1) create a HBase table with Hive:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE testwq100 (row_key string COMMENT 'from deserializer', application string COMMENT 'from deserializer', starttime timestamp COMMENT 'from deserializer', endtime timestamp COMMENT 'from deserializer', status string COMMENT 'from deserializer', statusid smallint COMMENT 'from deserializer',   insertdate timestamp COMMENT 'from deserializer', count int COMMENT 'from deserializer', errordesc string COMMENT 'from deserializer') ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseSerDe' STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler' WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( 'hbase.columns.mapping'='cf1:application,cf1:starttime,cf1:endtime,cf1:Status,cf1:StatusId,cf1:InsertDate,cf1:count,cf1:ErrorDesc', 'line.delim'='\\\\n',   'mapkey.delim'='\\\\^C', 'serialization.format'='\\\\^A') TBLPROPERTIES ('transient_lastDdlTime'='1489696241', 'hbase.table.name' = 'xyz', 'hbase.mapred.output.outputtable' = 'xyz')\r\n```\r\n(2) verify:\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\nInsert data into the Hbase table `testwq100` from Spark SQL:\r\n```\r\nscala> sql(s\"INSERT INTO testwq100 VALUES
