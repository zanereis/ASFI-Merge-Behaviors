Change Logs\r\nIf you try to sync to the metastore with a table with capital letters, you will see the warning:\r\n`Table name \"[TABLE_NAME]\" contains capital letters. Your metastore may auto convert this to lowercase and cause table not found errors.`\r\n\r\nTo test this I ran TestHoodieDeltaStreamer.testForceEmptyMetaSync and verified that the warning didn't show up. Then I changed the table name to include a capital letter and ran it again. The warning showed up. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis should help users if they encounter this issue in the future\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe record key is  \"{stock name}_{date} {hour}\". We have the data from 9:30-10:29 in batch_1 and batch_2 contains data from 10:30-10:59. This means that no new records are introduced, and therefore, only updates occur when ingesting batch_2. This makes validation of the data take too long for our testing. \r\n\r\nSolution is to move the data from 10:00-10:29 into batch_2 so that we will have updates and inserts in both files.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed through testing that this change works as intended and will make our bundle testing better.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBetter for testing.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen the clean planner lists the files in the partitions and it doesn't find any file to delete, the clean operation is skipped without any commit, then in the next clean, if the incremental cleaning mode is enabled, the clean planner doesn't find any information about the checked commits, and it will recheck all the files a second time. This PR creates a clean commit contains the `earliestCommitToRetain` regardless the deleted files list, in this case the clean planner will check only the partitions that have been changed since the `earliestCommitToRetain` in the last clean commit.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nA new clean commit will be added to the timeline even if there was not a real clean operation. For the benefits, a big performance improvement (and cost reduction of S3 listing) in cleaning operation for table where old partitions are seldom changed.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow:\r\nThe risk level is low because these changes affects only the clean plans without files to delete, and I kept the checks on the empty commit files to avoid Avro empty file exception, and I improved the method which clean this empty files. If for some reason we have an empty Avro file, a brute force will be performed to prepare the clean plan.\r\nI will test these changes on our project within the week to make sure everything is fine\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAs of now, during completion of a write operation, we [unpersist all persisted Rdds](https://github.com/apache/hudi/blob/b78c3441c4e28200abec340eaff852375764cbdb/hudi-client/hudi-spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hudi/client/SparkRDDWriteClient.java#L584) in the same sparkcontext. This can cause issues w/ multiple threads/writes to same table (for eg, async clean and regular writer). one operation could unpersist all persisted rdds while other is making progress. \r\n\r\nFix:\r\nWe need a way to keep track of all persisted RDD ids for a given write operation and unpersist only those in the end. \r\n- Initially thought we can leverage JavaSparkContext.setEngineProperty, but looks like its applicable only for current thread. So multiple threads within the same process may not share the same properties. \r\n\r\nApart from this, I could not locate any other mutable property that can be accessed from lower layers (action executors) and also by write clients, unless we change the all methods to take in extra argument and return extra argument. \r\n\r\nSo, only viable option I can think of is introducing a static hashmap which can be accessed from anywhere. So, lower layer class like action executors will add entries to this hashmap. Key refers to table+commit time and value refers to comma separated list of persisted RDD Ids. \r\n\r\nDuring release resource call towards completion of a write, we can unpersist only those rdds which are part of the tracked entry in the hashmap. \r\n\r\nDeltastreamer unpersist:\r\nSince the WriteClient.releaseResources() already unpersist the rdds, unpersist call in DeltaSync is redundant and have removed it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis might help w/ Stable and consistent results. If not, there could be unintentional unpersistance and spark could re-trigger some other unrelated actions. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\nThis might help w/ Stable and consistent results. If not, there could be unintentional unpersistance and spark could re-trigger some other unrelated actions. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-23T00:52:12Z","updated_at":"2023-03-06T23:11:42Z","closed_at":"2023-03-06T23:11:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07f17deede5e6cf90d9e07fc95f45931dc91e35a","assignee":{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"xushiyan","id":2701446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MDE0NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2701446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan","html_url":"https://github.com/xushiyan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xushiyan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhile applying commit metadata to metadata table, there is an argument \"isTableService\" to determine whether the triggering action is a table service or not. We mistakenly considered any replace commit as table service. Right fix is, only clustering is table service and other replace commits are not. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nMetadata compaction will make progress with replace commit actions like INSERT_OVERRIDE after this patch. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIf a user enabled clustering and after sometime disabled it due to whatever reason, there is a chance that there is a pending clustering left in the timeline. But once clustering is disabled, this could just be lying around. but this could affect metadata table compaction whcih in turn might affect the data table archival. \r\nFix: \r\nIntroduce a new config (`hoodie.rollback.pending.clustering`) which users can enable to rollback any pending clustering. Once this is enabled and if clustering in general is disabled, hudi will rollback any pending clustering from the timeline. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWill help making archival progress w/ metadata enabled. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium. If not for this patch, metadata compaction will not happen and could end up in a state where table is un-usable for queries. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nA new config is added. Website will be updated during regular release process. \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFix `SerializationUtils.java`\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nCurrently `Utf8` is being serialized as generic object by implicitly generated serializer (based on FieldSerializer), essentially serializing all of its fields. \r\n\r\nThis is inefficient and causes some friction in some exotic setups when (as described in the attached issue) version of Avro used on the Write Path might be diverging from the one used on the Read Path (this occurs, b/c since b/w 1.8.2 and 1.10.2, `Utf8` acquired one more field and therefore its payload couldn't be deserialized by implicitly gen'd serializer).\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWith async cleaner, two threads are trying to instantiate metadata concurrently w/o locks and runs into issues. I could not reproduce locally though. But likely its the issue. \r\nStacktrace shows that, metadata table validity fails. Only reason this could happen is, if there were two concurrent threads trying to instantiate metadata table. One of them goes ahead and creates \"metadata\" dir and then \"metadata/.hoodie\" dir and then goes ahead w/ instantiating the metadata table, while the other thread just sees that \"metadata\" dir exists and assumes metadata table is already instantiated and proceeds w/ commit. And so the exception. \r\n\r\nWe do have locks for any access to metadata table including instantiation. Just that for test w/ async cleaning we did not configure any locks, it fails often due to this race condition. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nAdding lock provider to test cleaner tests. \r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\n`CopyOnWriteInputFormat#createInputSplits` is invoked by `org.apache.flink.runtime.executiongraph.ExecutionJobVertex` in JobManager to create file input splits synchronously. \r\n\r\nIt's found that in batch mode this will occupy the largest share of job submission time.\r\n\r\nSo in this PR it will be optimized by creating input splits in thread pool executor asynchronously.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSpeed up job submission by reducing input splits creation time comsuption.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n`read.cow.create-split-async.enabled`: Whether create input splits asynchronously for CopyOnWriteInputFormat reading, default true.\r\n`read.cow.create-split-async.min-parallelism`: Min parallelism to parse the real parallelism of thread pool for CopyOnWriteInputFormat to create input splits asynchronously.\r\nWe should take the real job manager processors under consideration when to increase it.\r\n`read.cow.create-split-async.max-parallelism`: Max parallelism to parse the real parallelism of thread pool for CopyOnWriteInputFormat to create input splits asynchronously. \r\nWe will use the file count when it's smaller than the given value.\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFlink Table Planner will invoke `HoodieTableSource.copy()` when applying its `RelOptRule` such as\r\n`PushPartitionIntoTableSourceScanRule`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n        // apply push down\r\n        DynamicTableSource dynamicTableSource = tableSourceTable.tableSource().copy();\r\n        PartitionPushDownSpec partitionPushDownSpec =\r\n                new PartitionPushDownSpec(remainingPartitions);\r\n        partitionPushDownSpec.apply(dynamicTableSource, SourceAbilityContext.from(scan));\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThus it results in multiple meta client instantiation, which will affect the performance of starting job quickly.\r\n\r\nHere we suggest that meta client should be cached to be reused.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nSpeed up flink sql job start by avoiding unnecessary meta client repeated creation.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWe're shading kryo (a hudi-common dep) in all bundles. But `SerDeUtils` import kryo directly, which causes conflicts with spark, which expects unshaded kryo. We should avoid instantiating Kryo directly and always use `org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer` to bridge the usage.\r\n\r\nFollow up fix of https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6873\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nModified impl of SerDeUtils may behavior slightly different in serde for spark sql `merge into`.\r\n\r\n### Risk level \r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNA\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nRecently we landed a patch where we reduced duplicate stats from commit metadata (https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/6646/)\r\n\r\nBut looks like runtime stats were not serialized

Change Logs\r\nUsing delta streamer and validate in spark shell:\r\n- test utilities bundle \r\n- test  utilities slim bundle + spark bundle\r\n\r\nOne concern I have is that I don't think that the scala validation does much. It checks to see if the number of records in the delta streamer output matches the number of records in the json files. The reason I believe that this is not that good of a validation is that most of the data is updates rather than new records. If something with delta streamer silently fails I don't think we will catch it because all the records will probably be there but many updates could be missing. I do have a check on the size of the output directory, but I don't think I understand our storage enough at all to know if that is sufficient for a major loss of updates and probably won't even detect a minor loss.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nBetter testing in github for changes to bundles\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nI

Change Logs\r\n\r\n1. Add HoodieSparkValidateDuplicateKeyRecordMerger behaving the same as ValidateDuplicateKeyPayload. We should use  it with config \"hoodie.sql.insert.mode=strict\".\r\n2. Fix nest field exist in HoodieCatalystExpressionUtils\r\n3. Fix rewrite in HoodieInternalRowUtiles to support type promoted as avro\r\n4. Fallback to avro when use \"merge into\" sql\r\n5. Fix some schema handling issue\r\n6. Support delta streamer\r\n7. Convert parquet schema to spark schema and then avro schema(in org.apache.hudi.io.storage.HoodieSparkParquetReader#getSchema). Some types in avro are not compatible with parquet. For ex, decimal as int32/int64 in parquet will convert to int/long in avro. Because avro do not has decimal as int/long . We will lose the logic type info if we directly convert it to avro schema.\r\n8. Support schema evolution in parquet block\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\n_Describe any public API or user-facing feature change or any performance impact._\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website.

Change Logs\r\n\r\nBefore, when we used spark sql, we still didn't have a good way to incrementally read and time travel the hudi table. So, I added the CopyToTempView Procedure. This method will register the hudi table with spark's temporary view table, and data development can directly access the view table for different ways of reading.\r\nIn the spark sql console, the time travel read is implemented as follows.\r\n```sql\r\ncall copy_to_temp_view(table=>'$tableName',view_name=>'$viewName',query_type=>'snapshot',as_of_instant=>'20221018055647688')\r\nselect * from $viewName\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nadd new Procedure\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nadd new Procedure\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate
