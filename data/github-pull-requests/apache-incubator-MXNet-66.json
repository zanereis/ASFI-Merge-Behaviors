relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] AllReduce, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Decouple Batch Norm, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] SumSquare,  tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis is to address https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/10282\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if

Description ##\r\nIn this PR, it aligns with #10104's NNVM registration way and creates a fused GRU operator for CPU.\r\n@pengzhao-intel, @TaoLv , @Sherry-zhang \r\n\r\n## Feature changes ##\r\n### New features ###\r\n- Single layer and unidirectional GRU, including both forward and backward computation.\r\n\r\n### Removed features ###\r\n- Since the code is refactored with NNVM interfaces, comment rnn.cu as it is tracked on #10104.\r\n\r\n### Unit-test changes ###\r\n- Create new test test_gru in tests/python/unittests/test_operator.py.\r\n- Check consistency with original GRUCell implementation.\r\n- Check consistency of FP32 and FP64 outputs.\r\n\r\n### Performance ###\r\nWe have tested performance of sym.RNN and rnn.GRUCell on our local Skylake-6148 with 2 Sockets and 40 cores. Use MKL as blas lib in this performance test.\r\nTest input size is from DS2 default parameters(seq_length = 300, batch_size = 20, input_size = 800, hidden_size = 800).\r\n\r\n| API | Inference

example by comparing dense & rowsparse weights. The results are the same. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

We should choose the right default layout for different MKLDNN layouts.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\n(resubmitted due to merge issues)\r\n\r\nAdded load from function buffers for CPP package\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Added equivalent functions for the loading, from buffers instead of files\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Duplicates functionality from Python

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the dependences of `mx.io` and `mx.initializer` on the numpy's global random number generator. The dependences are not sound as they introduce unnecessary coupling with user's environment and confuse newcomers about seeding. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this PR is accepted, I'll make similar PRs removing the dependences on python's and numpy's global random number generators from `rnn/io`, `gluon`'s samplers and so

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the dependences of `mx.io` and `mx.initializer` on the numpy's global random number generator. The dependences are not sound as they introduce unnecessary coupling with user's environment and confuse newcomers about seeding. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this PR is accepted, I'll make similar PRs removing the dependences on python's and numpy's global random number generators from `rnn/io`, `gluon`'s samplers and so

Description ##\r\nEnhancement of test_leaky_relu and test_prelu\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-142]\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Improve test_leaky_relu to provide coverage for all float types\r\n- [x] Improve test_prelu to provide coverage for all float types\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This PR aims to address the issue with previous version of test_leaky_relu caused by precision issues with finite difference method with floating point 16 data type\r\n- With some experiment I discovered that finite difference method may not be suitable for checking numeric gradients with 16-bit floating point inputs. Here's an example (All numbers used are represented by 16-bit floating point numbers):\r\nx: [[-0.9,-0.8,-0.7],\r\n     [-0.6,-0.5,-0.4],\r\n     [-0.3,-0.2,-0.1],\r\n     [0.1,0.2,0.3],\r\n     [0.4,0.5,0.6],\r\n     [0.7,0.8,0.9]]\r\nact_type: leaky_relu\r\nslope:0.25\r\nAnalytical Derivative:\r\n[[0.25,0.25,0.25],\r\n [0.25,0.25,0.25],\r\n [0.25,0.25,0.25],\r\n [ 1.0 ,  1.0 ,  1.0],\r\n [ 1.0 ,  1.0 ,  1.0],\r\n [ 1.0 ,  1.0 ,  1.0]]\r\nNumeric Derivative from finite difference method with epsilon=1e-4:\r\n[[ 0.61035156  0.61035156  0.61035156]\r\n [ 0.61035156  0.30517578  0.30517578]\r\n [ 0.30517578  0.15258789  0.22888184]\r\n [ 0.91552734  0.61035156  1.22070312]\r\n [ 1.22070312  1.22070312  2.44140625]\r\n [ 2.44140625  2.44140625  2.44140625]]\r\nNow if we divide all values in x by 256, which means we are shrinking their absolute values, then apply numeric method with the same epsilon=1e-4, we get a new set of derivatives:\r\n[ 0.25268555  0.25268555  0.25268555]\r\n [ 0.25268555  0.25024414  0.25024414]\r\n [ 0.25024414  0.24914551  0.24975586]\r\n [ 0.99902344  0.99658203  1.00097656]\r\n [ 1.00097656  1.00097656  1.01074219]\r\n [ 1.01074219  1.01074219  1.01074219]]\r\nWe can see that derivatives from numeric and analytical methods have way bigger difference when the absolute value of input x gets bigger. As a result, we need to use a smaller range for drawing the random inputs if we want to do verification through numeric methods on 16-bit floating point numbers or even abandon the numeric check for that as long as we can get the correct analytical results.\r\n- I chose to skip the numeric tests for float16 type as it's very flaky even if we shrink the absolute values of the randomly generated test inputs, now the seeds for both tests are not fixed, but numeric check is only performed for float32 and float64 data

Description ##\r\nHi, there.\r\nThere is parameters name inconsistent in Proposal OP and Multi Proposal OP.\r\nProposal OP:\r\n[cls_prob](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/contrib/proposal-inl.h#L160) vs [cls_score](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/contrib/proposal.cc#L462)\r\n\r\nMulti Proposal OP:\r\n[cls_prob](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/contrib/multi_proposal-inl.h#L162) vs [cls_score](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/contrib/multi_proposal.cc#L500)\r\n\r\nIt seems that the parameter name should be `cls_prob` rather than `cls_score`.\r\n[The parameter prompt](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/contrib/proposal-inl.h#L107)\r\n[Faster R-CNN example](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/example/rcnn/rcnn/symbol/symbol_resnet.py#L193)\r\n\r\nSo I replace `cls_score` with `cls_prob`, and I change the parameter name in the unittest for Proposal OP and Multi Proposal OP.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Replace the parameter name `cls_score` with `cls_prob` in Proposal OP and Multi Proposal OP\r\n- [x] Change the parameter name `cls_score` in the unit-test for Proposal OP and Multi Proposal OP

Description ##\r\nIt seems the order of `join` and `expanduser` are somehow reversed. This is a pull request to fix the tiny bug.\r\n\r\nPlease ensure the code is runnable before push/merge, as the example codes are VERY important to beginners.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-24T08:41:04Z","updated_at":"2018-03-25T04:20:00Z","closed_at":"2018-03-25T03:32:40Z","merged_at":"2018-03-25T03:32:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"0ca6dd29cb923c59925c76981bfd5a632a72a8ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10236/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10236/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10236/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/5eee59292f255dcbc6d9cb94a7c560caf3118f23","head":{"label":"Lyken17:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"5eee59292f255dcbc6d9cb94a7c560caf3118f23","user":{"login":"Lyken17","id":7783214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODMyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7783214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17","html_url":"https://github.com/Lyken17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":99966955,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5OTk2Njk1NQ==","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"Lyken17/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lyken17","id":7783214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODMyMTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7783214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17","html_url":"https://github.com/Lyken17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lyken17/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lyken17/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nWhen profiling aggregate stats, `ImperativeBulk()` will group many ops together, making the aggregate statistics nonsensical and useless.  \r\n\r\nThis change keeps the bulk size as zero when profiling aggregate stats, so that operator statistics are kept separate.  This has a slight performance hit, although recording aggregate stats *already* has a slight performance hit, so it isn't introducing anything new in that area.  This is explained in the python description:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef set_config(**kwargs):\r\n    \"\"\"Set up the configure of profiler (only accepts keyword arguments).\r\n\r\n    Parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    ...\r\n    aggregate_stats : boolean,\r\n        whether to maintain aggregate stats in memory for console\r\n        dump.  Has some negative performance impact.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

Description ##\r\n\r\nFix a test which causes an error with opencv 3.4.1. I'm not sure which version of opencv is used in mxnet's testing environment but the `test_resize_short` in `test_image.py` causes the following error on my Arch linux system with opencv 3.4.1 and python 3.6.4.\r\n```\r\n======================================================================\r\nERROR: test_resize_short

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nIt installs the latest ONNX release in the CI pipeline. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Installs the latest ONNX release in the Mxnet CI pipeline.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Instead of doing a apt-get install for libprotobuf-dev and protobuf-compiler, we are now building these two packages from source, because ONNX v1.1.0 requires libprotoc v3.4.0 but the apt-get command installs v2.6.\r\n@marcoabreu @spidyDev @Roshrini

Description ##\r\nSupports distributed training with float16 (and technically float64 as well). \r\n\r\n- Modified parameter server to work at byte level, so that we can send both fp16 and fp32 gradients while training in fp16 and mixed precision modes. The user does not have to do anything special to handle fp16 gradients. KVStore handles it internally. Even originally, ps-lite later converted data to char, doing this at an earlier step gives mxnet more flexibility.\r\n\r\n- The type of request and data type received by server are encoded in a command which is computed using the [Cantor pairing function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pairing_function#Cantor_pairing_function). This generates a unique number `z` given two numbers `x` and `y`, and allows us to invert this number `z` to give the unique original pair of numbers `x` and `y`.\r\n\r\n- For keys with fp16 gradients, they are sent as fp16. All computation on server is done in fp16, and the server responds to worker's pull responses as fp16.\r\n\r\n- FP16 support depends heavily on CPU computation with fp16. This is currently very slow in MXNet. \r\nThere are two things which can greatly improve this speed. I have made PRs for both. So for best performance and to get the below numbers we would need to merge these two PRs\r\n    - Leveraging F16C instruction set support on x86 machines for fast conversion between float16 and float.  [PR in MShadow](https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/pull/330)\r\n    - Replacing mshadow Eval with Kernel Launch [PR in MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9029)\r\n\r\n## Results ##\r\n8 p3.8x machines, with all 4 gpus being used. Throughput in samples/sec for resnet-50 with imagenet synthetic data\r\n\r\n| FP32  | FP16 | Comments |\r\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\r\n| 560  | 150 | Only this PR |\r\n| 610  | 780  | With this PR and [PR 9029 in MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9029) |\r\n| 610  | 1100  | With this PR,  [PR 9029 in MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9029) and [PR 330 in MShadow](https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/pull/330) |\r\n\r\nThe effect of PR 9029 is not much for fp32 end to end, but on profiling we do see that the addition operations is faster with Kernel launch. But it is hidden by other factors. In the case of fp16 and gradient compression, the effect is very visible.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Change kvdist and kvdist_server to receive float, half and double datatypes\r\n- [x] Some sparse server side handling refactored into functions\r\n- [x] Added nightly tests, and cleaned up some existing tests\r\n\r\n### Comments ###\r\n- Gradient compression is only supported for fp32.

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nGenerate Documentation for the Infer Package, currently only generated for core package.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

mxnet\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Unfortunately USE_LAPACK switch does not work at the moment (undefined references while linking mxnet). Now the define is forced on all platforms, if switched off multiple unit tests break [MXNET-115](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-115)\r\n- If used with USE_LAPACK it requires a separate llapack library which is not available, because lapack is linked by default into the OpenBLAS so file.\r\n- Unfortunately OpenBLAS has a bug that prevents -static-libgfortran to work properly, leaving the only option to supply openblas -lgfortran for linker

Description ##\r\nAdd support for any datatype for Leaky ReLU operator, mentioned in issue #2302.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Change LeakyReLU operator from only supporting real_t to supporting any datatype\r\n- [x] Add test coverage for \"elu\" activation type of LeakyReLU\r\n- [x] Add test coverage for \"leaky\" activation type of LeakyReLU\r\n- [x] Add test coverage for \"prelu\" activation type of LeakyReLU\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThe test for rrelu is harder to write as rrelu contains random components in forward pass, will figure out a way to write a test for it

Description ##\r\n\r\n[MXNET-114](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-114)\r\nIn tutorials files, sometimes we have statements like `img.plot()` that generates an image. For the tutorials to be entertaining, we may want to include an example generated image using the image tag like this:\r\n`![png](img_url)`. \r\n\r\nHowever this means that currently, at run-time, if someone downloads the generated notebook, they will see twice the image. Once from execution, and once from the markdown line.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we introduce a way to have `.md` lines that are not included in the notebook, giving a better experience to our tutorials users.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [x] For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Adding ability to hide specific lines from tutorials, tested on locally built version of the website\r\n\r\n### Test ###\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n![screen shot 2018-03-19 at 6 41 37

Description ##\r\nSet threads created by MXNetHandler to Daemon threads so they exit when the main thread exits.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis is to fix the memory alignment for the memory allocator. When we allocate memory for MKLDNN, we only need to make the memory address aligned to 64. This change also seems to fix a memory error in the test of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/10021\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not

feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nAdd a sparse operator on CPU that supports broadcast_mul/div(csr, dense) = csr operations.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-117]\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add support for broadcast_mul/div(csr, 1Ddense) = csr\r\n- [ ] Add support for broadcast_mul/div(csr,

Description ##\r\nThis PR implements Python APIs of logging MXNet data for visualization in [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/summaries_and_tensorboard).\r\n- Design proposal: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Logging+MXNet+Data+for+Visualization+in+TensorBoard\r\n- Jira link: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-109\r\n\r\n### Why choose TensorBoard as the frontend for data visualization? ###\r\n- TensorBoard has a nice GUI for data visualization and it's production environment friendly.\r\n- Installing TensorBoard is as simple as typing `pip install tensorboard` in a terminal.\r\n\r\n### How are MXNet logging APIs implemented? ###\r\n- The major logging components are ported from their Python and C++ implementations in [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) as documented in the code.\r\n- The algorithm of encoding data written to event files are borrowed from https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/tensorboard_logger.\r\n- We adopted the user-level logging API design from https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboard-pytorch.\r\n- This work is inspired by @zihaolucky 's pioneering efforts on [dmlc/tensorboard](https://github.com/dmlc/tensorboard). Special thanks to him for many technical discussions during the process of development.\r\n\r\n### How to use MXNet logging APIs? ###\r\nPlease find the details in the following document: https://github.com/reminisce/mxnet/blob/tensorboard_logging/docs/api/python/contrib/summary.md\r\n\r\n### Is there an example demonstrating logging data for visualization in a training job? ###\r\nYes, please see here for logging data when training an MNIST model using the Gluon interfaces.\r\nhttps://github.com/reminisce/mxnet/blob/tensorboard_logging/example/visualization/tensorboard/mnist.py. Search for `sw` (short for `SummaryWriter`) in the code to see how logging APIs are used.\r\n\r\n## References ##\r\n1. https://github.com/dmlc/tensorboard\r\n2. https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/tensorboard_logger\r\n3. https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboard-pytorch\r\n4. https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow\r\n\r\nPlease help to review and feel free to @ more reviewers. Thanks!\r\n@piiswrong @szha @eric-haibin-lin @zhreshold @astonzhang @zihaolucky @cjolivier01 @marcoabreu @anirudh2290 @rahul003 @haojin2 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nFix typo in autograd doc\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either

Description ##\r\nReopen #8922\r\n\r\nThe previous implementation of sparse batch loader waits for the number of data instances reaches batch_size before allocating the buffer for copy (unlike dense batch loader, we don't know the actual buffer size to allocate since the number of non-zeros varies). However, such delayed allocate is buggy when batch size is extremely large, because the DataInst returned by base_ is only a reference to the data. By the time copy happens, the referenced data might already be updated by the parser.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the sparse batch loader to be almost the same as batch loader, except that:\r\n- data buffer is allocated based on estimation, and adjusted when capacity is not sufficient\r\n- before returning the output, the shape of tensor has to reflect the actual number of elements in the tensor.\r\n\r\n@cjolivier01 @reminisce @anirudh2290 @ZiyueHuang\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-15T18:43:33Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T18:06:13Z","closed_at":"2018-03-27T20:30:03Z","merged_at":"2018-03-27T20:30:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"e08e1fdaa26cb05fac4c152fc662e77130e8db35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":206159502,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDYxNTk1MDI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":355414483,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzNTU0MTQ0ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Data-loading","name":"Data-loading","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10124/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10124/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10124/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/88c4f5e71785dc542338ecaa6e03421626e47f88","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:iter","ref":"iter","sha":"88c4f5e71785dc542338ecaa6e03421626e47f88","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [ ] Passed code style checking (`make lint`)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-15T17:16:15Z","updated_at":"2018-03-27T04:03:47Z","closed_at":"2018-03-22T22:57:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68c0923e6cf2540becfd10607f7ba17578c5c5c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"cjolivier01","id":11234557,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjM0NTU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11234557?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01","html_url":"https://github.com/cjolivier01","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cjolivier01/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/10122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/10122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b335ad8a9786f75eac85d8f2964856c3e014c05b","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:dlpack","ref":"dlpack","sha":"b335ad8a9786f75eac85d8f2964856c3e014c05b","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","u
