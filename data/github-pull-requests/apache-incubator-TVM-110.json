It contains the following changes\r\n\r\n- [x] C source style codegen to generate TVM compatible C library wrapper that can be compiled and library together with DSOModule\r\n- [x] DNNL codegen that generates DNNL kernel wrappers to execute part of a Relay program\r\n- [x] DNNL library kernel that initializes dnnl engine for execution.\r\n- [x] graphruntime execution\r\n- [x] All external functions are collected for codegen and an array of external runtime modules are returned and imported to the DSOModule.\r\n- [x] Various unit tests\r\n\r\nFollowup PRs will to send separately to cover the following aspects:\r\n- VM execution\r\n- Move comprehensive dnnl kernels\r\n- Annotation and partitioning\r\n\r\nCC @tqchen @soiferj @masahi @jroesch @icemelon9 @u99127 @comaniac \r\n

Given that TVM is supported NCHW and NHWC, \r\nand if our target hardware support NHWC， we should add  NHWC layout in onnx frontend to produce the NHWC graph and finally compute on the target

Now every frontend framework does not support layout choice depend. Such as, relay.frontend.from_onnx only support NCHW and relay.frontend.from_tensorflow only support NHWC. Given that TVM is supported NCHW and NHWC, \r\nand if our target hardware support NHWC， we should add  NHWC layout in onnx frontend to produce the NHWC graph and finally compute on the target hardware. \r\n\r\n@vinx13 would you be able to take a

the RPC function does not allow directly passing a remote module as an argument.

We also updated the graph runtime implementation to simply use the create function(instead of the remote_create function).\r\n\r\nNOTE: this change will require the upgrade of both RPC server and

`crop_and_resize` op into topi and relay and TensorFlow frontend. \r\n\r\nSome of the reasons why we need `crop_and_resize` are as below:\r\n\r\n- `CropAndResize` is being used in TensorFlow frequently in both training and inference, 'almost' all models (such as ssd, maskrcnn, etc.) in tensorflow object detection zoo are using this op.\r\n- It is possible to use `strided_slice`, `resize` and `concatenate` to compose `crop_and_resize` for some cases,  but the composition is not able to cover all cases, for example, when  `extrapolation_value` is used, `boxes` and/or `box_indices` are not list, etc. \r\n- Most importantly, using `strided_slice`, `resize` and `concatenate` to build `CropAndResize` will introduce a significant number of ops in the converted relay ir when there are a lot of boxes as input, it does happen in models like ssd in tensorflow object detection model zoo.\r\n\r\n@kevinthesun @zhiics @icemelon9 @jwfromm @jroesch

I noticed that the performance for gpu drops significantly for conv2d with untuned workload. I did some investigation and some results are shown below:\r\ntest script: https://gist.github.com/zxy844288792/af05f12895ceaa2ba754ff22116b341d\r\n\r\nAfter Commit [Bump up CUDA log version in tophub.py] 888a3c35cf53f6af6cb9bcca4ff3e917ea6fafca \r\nNode Name        Ops              Time(us)  Time(%)  Shape              Inputs  Outputs  \r\n---------        ---              --------  -------  -----              ------  -------  \r\nfused_nn_conv2d  fused_nn_conv2d  15119.7   100.0    (1, 32, 512, 512)  2       1        \r\nTotal_time       -                15119.7   -        -                  -       -   \r\n\r\nBefore Commit [Bump up CUDA log version in tophub.py] 888a3c35cf53f6af6cb9bcca4ff3e917ea6fafca \r\nNode Name        Ops              Time(us)  Time(%)  Shape              Inputs  Outputs  \r\n---------        ---              --------  -------  -----              ------  -------  \r\nfused_nn_conv2d  fused_nn_conv2d  68.82     100.0    (1, 32, 512, 512)  2       1 \r\n\r\nThe performance drops 200x than before. The commit [Bump up CUDA log version in tophub.py] only modifies the tuned schedule file by adding one more line of schedules for conv2d_transpose_nchw. In fact the root cause of this issue is that for a untuned workload, we are trying to find the most similar tuned one from the file to mimic its parameters. And the formal logic was trying to use the \"model\" of the last line of tuned schedule file as a reference. In this case, as we added one more line to the schedule file with \"model\" = v100, so it is trying to use all tuned schedules for v100 to mimic the parameters. However, we only have one tuned schedule for v100 so it does not help here. \r\n\r\nThe change I made is instead of using the last line as the reference, we fisrt will count the number of tuned schedules and if we need to mimic the parameters, it will choose the model with the most tuned schedules.\r\n\r\nAfter applying the above logic, the performance goes back to normal level as shown below:\r\nNode Name        Ops              Time(us)  Time(%)  Shape              Inputs  Outputs  \r\n---------        ---              --------  -------  -----              ------  -------  \r\nfused_nn_conv2d  fused_nn_conv2d  68.675    100.0    (1, 32, 512, 512)  2       1 \r\n\r\n@merrymercy @eqy \r\nI want to hear some feedbacks if the change here is valid.\r\n\r\nThanks for contributing to TVM!

Add a function to set the qnn output range wrt each elemwise operation.\r\n* Add comments warning for nonsense clamped output in the tflite/tvm results comparison.\r\n\r\nA separate output range for each operation has to be defined since if we specify a single range that to work in general for all elemwise operations it will result in a lower accuracy and clamped outputs when we test those elemwise operators whose possible output range is much smaller.\r\n\r\nThe warning comments point to the the problem with clamping that can be easily overlooked because  once tflite clipps the ouput tensor values to 0 or 255 then that output tensor get consumed by tvm and as a result the tflite_ouput and tvm_ouput are the same... so they pass the assertion.\r\n\r\n**The only things that the future testwriter has to do are:\r\n**1)** set all the input tensors to [-100; 100] float 32 in the tf graph -> the quantization parameters are hardcoded regarding that range\r\n**2)** define the range of the output tensor with respect to the particular operation.\r\n**3)** pass the uint8 input data to the graph in [0; 255]**

PR fixed an issue in the streamlined GEMM execution by disabling pipelined adder, which consumes 4 cycles (in case of LOG_BLOCK=4) in addition to the single-cycle fused multiplier-adder. This is much longer than the 4-stage streamline design in the `TensorGemm` module, so instead of creating a routine to wait for the pipelined adder, this PR disabled the pipelined adder and bring the accumulated results to the output instantly.\r\n\r\nPreviously, the SMT schedule for GEMM in `test_vta_insn.py` was successful simply because the streamlined GEMM execution doesn't accumulate on the row, so there is no dependency between stage cycles in the TensorGemm module.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR brings successful evaluation of `matrix_multiply.py`, `matrix_multiply_opt.py` and `convolution_opt.py` under the `tutorials` directory.\r\n\r\n@vegaluisjose @tmoreau89 Please
