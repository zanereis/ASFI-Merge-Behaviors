Description\r\n\r\nCurrently the implementation of concise bitmap unifies bitmaps by construct a new bitmap with the help of heap sort. And the union operation is quite slow when encountering a large number of bitmaps to unify.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to improve the performance of the union operation of concise bitmap. It optimises the heap sort to counting sort when the number of bitmaps to unify reaches a certain threshold. And the counting sort used here is based on the implementation of roaring bitmap.\r\n\r\nAccording to the benchmark report, the performance is improved by 4~10 times when unifying more than 100 bitmaps. See the visual jmh report [here](https://jmh.morethan.io/?gists=781a537f485f55c8403093419c13cdb5,513102af06bc77f70b8db6b9711b88c0)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts #9509 for 0.18.1. The lag metric for Kinesis was first introduced in 0.18.0, but it turns out there are a couple of flaws in the `RecordSupplier` and `SeekableStreamSupervisor` which can freeze the Kinesis supervisor for minutes due to lock contentions. https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/9819 is to fix such flaws, but I think we should roll back this feature for the minor release since the fix doesn't look simple enough.","created_at":"2020-05-04T23:55:55Z","updated_at":"2020-05-05T18:10:43Z","closed_at":"2020-05-05T18:10:42Z","merged_at":"2020-05-05T18:10:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"100f7f8b69868bb650ef1251ea3a88d03555fee9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":690563043,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMwNDM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Streaming%20Ingestion","name":"Area

#TBD. (need to open an issue about an issue that occur in kinesis ingestion in streams with a large number of shards).\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR refactors and fixes a number of issues with `SeekableStreamSupervisor`, and the Kinesis and Kafka indexing services built on top of it.\r\n\r\n#### `SeekableStreamSupervisor` and `RecordSupplier`\r\nThe manner in which `SeekableSteamSupervisor` uses the `RecordSupplier` has been heavily refactored to be much more chill. Prior to this patch, the main run thread, http threads, and background threads of the `SeekableSteamSupervisor` would all fight over the `RecordSupplier` with conflicting assignments, despite the fact that all usages are for the same set of partitions it has assigned to the tasks it is monitoring. This was extra unchill to the kinesis supervisor, which these assignments and subsequent seeks would result in creating and destroying a threadpool  executor multiple times even in a single supervisor run cycle.\r\n\r\nA new method, `assignRecordSupplierToPartitionIds` has been added which is used to assign the `partitionIds` to the `recordSupplier` whenever `partitionIds` changes, to ensure that the list of partitions we care about are always known to the `recordSupplier`. Prior users of `recordSupplier.assign` now count on the partition being known by the `recordSupplier`, and everything plays together much more harmoniously.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `recordSupplierLock` has been changed to a `ReentrantLock`, to prevent the chance that the same thread can end up deadlocked by making calls to various internal supervisor methods that interact with the `recordSupplier`.\r\n\r\n#### `SupervisorStateManager.isSteadyState()`\r\nAn additional method has been added to `SupervisorStateManager` to allow `SeekableStreamSupervisor` background threads which collect information and emit metrics to be more considerate of supervisor state transitions, and just chill out while the supervisor reconfigures its internal state (no need to emit lag metrics while we are still creating tasks for example). This is just a convenience method to compare the current state to `healthySteadyState`.\r\n\r\n#### `updateLatestOffsetsFromStream` -> `updatePartitionLagFromStream`\r\n`updateLatestOffsetsFromStream` has been reworked into `updatePartitionLagFromStream`, since kinesis doesn't currently have a use for fetching the latest offsets since it can't compare them to the current offsets to compute record lag, so this change allows kafka to fetch the latest offsets, and kinesis to compute the partition time lag instead, dramatically cutting down on the number of AWS api calls and reducing the likely-hood of being rate limited.\r\n\r\n#### Kinesis time lag metric\r\nThe mechanism that collects the Kinesis supervisor has been reworked significantly, to no longer require holding a lock on the supplier since the method is stateless instead of using the underlying `PartitionResources` it has been assigned, meaning it can take advantage fo the thread-safe kinesis client to fetch the lag. Additionally, it now only fetches the minimum number of records, `1`, instead of the default of 10k. Finally, it is now aware of `useEarliestSequenceNumber` configuration, and will short circuit and return `0L` as the lag for the partition in the case where `useEarliestSequenceNumber` is false.\r\n\r\n#### Kinesis indexing task\r\nThe `KinesisRecordSupplier` used by the `KinesisIndexTask` will now use a much less aggro `Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors() * 2` as the default number of fetch threads instead of the number of partitions, which in the case of hundreds of partitions would result in hundreds of threads and finally, a dramatically increased chance for AWS api limit exceptions.\r\n\r\n#### Other `KinesisRecordSupplier` stuff\r\nStarting and stopping the `KinesisRecordSupplier` has been simplified to use `AtomicBoolean.compareAndSet` instead of a handful of volatile boolean primitives, to decrease the chance of race conditions, and make the logic less confusing to follow. Additionally, the supervisor now supplies `0` as the number of `fetchThreads`, since it doesn't have need to utilize background fetching at all, so we can avoid creating the threadpool entirely. Finally, I added a bunch of javadocs to make future incursions into this code much easier.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR allows `JoinFilterAnalyzer` to directly rewrite filters on RHS join columns into filters on the equivalent LHS join columns, allowing these filters to be pushed down to base tables.\r\n\r\nTo supports this two new methods are added to `Filter`:\r\n- `supportsRequiredColumnRewrite`\r\n- `rewriteRequiredColumns`\r\n\r\nThese methods are used to pass a map of column name rewrites to a Filter, which the Filter will use to return a copy of itself that operates on different columns.\r\n\r\nCurrent restrictions on such rewrites:\r\n- Only filters that reference a single column currently support such rewrites\r\n- Expression, Javascript, AND/OR, and Spatial filters are not currently supported\r\n  - For expression and javascript rewrites, we would need a good way to replace the identifiers for the new filter\r\n \r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\n`ParseSpec` has an interface `toInputFormat` which is supposed to return an inputFormat _equivalent_ to the parseSpec. This interface was added for easier migration from parseSpec to inputFormat; it seemed helpful to keep only one code path that uses inputFormat. However, it turns out this interface caused a couple of flaws. First, this interface has a default implementation returning null mostly for compatibility purpose; custom extensions don't have to be fixed for upgrading Druid cluster. This made us to still keep 2 code paths for both inputFormat and parseSpec. Second, the parseSpec can be silently converted to an inputFormat which makes sometimes people confused and hard to debug. A null check after conversion is another source of flaw. Finally, `ParseSpec` and `InputFormat` are not equivalent to each other; rather, `InputRowParser` + `ParseSpec` is equivalent to `InputFormat`. For example, `OrcInputFormat` has a field of `binaryAsString` which is missing in `OrcParseSpec` but in `OrcHadoopInputRowParser`. This PR removes `ParseSpec.toInputFormat` to address the above issues.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen The JsonReader flattens input it filters out key value pairs with null values, which prevents any all null column from being included as columns if no dimension spec is provided. This is a problem in the sampler because often all the entries in the sample will be null, meaning columns will be lost after flattening and wont appear in the web-console. The goal of this pr is to prevent the JSONFlattenMaker from removing null values from the document by adding a boolean flag keepNullColumns to the flattenSpec. This can then be added to the sampleSpec in the web console so that all null columns still appear in the ingestion flow.\r\n\r\nI added the Json property keepNullColumns to JsonPathSpec (this is the flattenSpec), as well as the method isKeepNullColumns() which returns the values.  KeepNullColumns defaults to false if not provided, meaning there should be no change to the current function unless the user explicitly sets it to true. \r\n\r\nThe JSONFlattenMaker class was modified to have a constructor that accepts keepNullColumns as a boolean value and is use to prevent discoverRootFields from filtering out null values. \r\n\r\nJSONReader passes keepNullColumns to the constructor of JSONFlattenMaker using the isKeepNullColumns() method. \r\n\r\nA test was added to JSONReaderTest to check that all columns including columns with null values are present as dimensions as well as flattening still works. \r\n\r\nLiterally every other file is just adding the value false to JSONPathSpecs in tests\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `JsonReader`\r\n *

Description\r\n\r\n#9484 introduced a bug that a filter treats all boolean values as nulls in transformation. For example, the below transformSpec filters out all rows.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n      \"transformSpec\": {\r\n        \"filter\": {\r\n          \"type\": \"selector\",\r\n          \"dimension\": \"booleanDimension\",\r\n          \"value\": \"false\"\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by falling back to the previous behavior when `rowValue` has a complex type. \r\n\r\nAnother bug with `strlen()` on multi-valued columns is fixed in this PR as well. The `strlen()` function should allow only single-valued columns. On the query side, the caller should be able to automatically apply `strlen()` to each element in the multi-valued column, which is already implemented. On the ingestion side, however, it doesn't explode multi-valued column automatically, and `strlen()` on multi-valued columns should fail.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

the documentation for `metricCompression` in `IndexSpec` is a bit confusing to both the users and developers. The wording sounds like byte level compression we pick in this config can be applied to metric columns of all types including non primitive types like complex aggregators while in reality the serde of complex aggregators is determined by the implementations themselves. The confusion also amplifies when developers are adding custom aggregators when they think they can get free byte level compression on top of the serialized bytes they produced in `ComplexMetricSerde#getSerializer`.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#9809.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently segment pruning uses the time interval. For further filtering on secondary partitions, only single dimension ShardSpec is supported (done in #2982). For hash based partitioning (`HashBasedNumberedShardSpec`), we can also apply pruning by rehash the `partitionDimensions` in the query filter to locate segments. \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this by rehashing the `partitionDimensions` values in `HashBasedNumberedShardSpec` from the query filter using the same hashing mechanism used during ingestion, and use the hashed value mod `partitions` to determine if it equals `partitionNum` of a segment. We only attempt pruning if 1) all `partitionDimensions` present in the query filter and 2) the values of `partitionDimensions` are discrete values not range values because we can't hash range values and 3) during ingestion time, `partitionDimensions` are explicitly set because otherwise the hash during ingestion is based on all dimensions plus the truncated input timestamp according to QueryGranularity instead of just `partitionDimensions` and we don't record timestamp in shard spec. Then we enumerate all combinations of the values of the dimensions in `partitionDimensions` drawn from the filter and check if the hashed value mod `partitions` matches the `partitionNum` of a segment. E.g., if the query contains filter \"dim1 = v1 and dim2 in (v2, v3, v4)\", then the hash values we will check are: hash(v1, v2), hash(v1, v3), hash(v1, v4).\r\n\r\n**Updated Jun 30:**\r\nTo accommodate latest changes in master branch, replace `partitionNum` with `bucketId` and `partitions` with `numBuckets` in the hashing logic if they present, otherwise the logic is the same as what's in above description.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

#9658\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, any columns with all null values are not processed by the sampler. There should be a parameter on the IOConfig that allows the user to specify that that they to keep columns with all null values. This feature should be implemented in the web-console. \r\n\r\nI am pretty new to this so my approach might be hilariously wrong, just know I know. \r\n\r\nThe problem is happening because columns with all null column values are treated as stringDimensions, and then fail the canSkip() in StringDimensionHandler and are subsequently skipped. To fix this, I added the JsonProperty disableNullColumnSkipping to the IOConfig and created the getter isDisableNullColumnSkipping(). If the values is not set then it will default to false which means null columns will be skipped and there should be no change to the current functionality. \r\n\r\nThe values disableNullColumnSkipping is used in two places. It is used in  stringDimensionMergerV6 CanSkip() so that it will always return false if disableNullColumnSkipping. Secondly, it is used in JsonReader to prevent the flattening of an inline datasource, this is necessary because flattening it will literally remove the null columns from the row so they never even end up in the incrementalIndex. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the changes are all there in order to pass the value from indexTask to JsonReader and IndexMergerV6 or updating tests to include the new value.\r\n\r\nI also changed LoadDataView.tsx so that the web-console always used this by default by setting disableNullColumnSkipping to true on the IoConfig; \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `IndexTask`\r\n *

Description\r\n\r\nThe `values` in `InDimFilter` can be sometimes huge especially with query inlining. In that case, the constructor of `InDimFilter` can take a long time to build a `TreeSet` for storing filter values. AFAIT, `values` doesn't have to be a `SortedSet`, but can be a `Set` instead except for cache key. To avoid sorting in the constructor but generate cache key in a deterministic way, `getCacheKey()` method needs to sort values when generating cache key. Since this method can be called often as well if cache is enabled, cache key is now cached in memory once it is created. Also, instead of storing all values in the cache key, a hash of values is stored now to avoid generating too long cache key.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR optimizes planning time by removing the `UnionMergeRule` instances from the SQL planner, which didn't provide much benefit in exchange for the amount that they exploded the planning space when a lot of unions were involved. From the Calcite source:\r\n```\r\n    // For Union and Intersect, we want to combine the set-op that's in the\r\n    // second input first.\r\n    //\r\n    // For example, we reduce\r\n    //    Union(Union(a, b), Union(c, d))\r\n    // to\r\n    //    Union(Union(a, b), c, d)\r\n    // in preference to\r\n    //    Union(a, b, Union(c, d))\r\n    //\r\n    // But for Minus, we can only reduce the left input. It is not valid to\r\n    // reduce\r\n    //    Minus(a, Minus(b, c))\r\n    // to\r\n    //    Minus(a, b, c)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the added benchmark as an example of the difference this change

For example: -->\r\n\r\nMy deployments had struggled with graceful shutdown of our Hadoop Batch Indexing tasks up until now. In the past, we simply patched out graceful shutdown since we didn't really mind the YARN apps not being killed. However, for our Druid 18 upgrade we wanted to get this fixed. \r\n\r\nAfter troubleshooting, we found that the code was getting hung in `ToolRunner#run` when trying to kill the YARN app for the indexing job. After some trial and error in our fork we discovered it was an authentication issue and that Calling into `JobHelper#authenticate` fixed the issue with the graceful shutdown code becoming hung. Our analysis of calling into `JobHelper#authenticate` let us to believe it is a harmless method to call multiple times and also harmless to call in a cluster that is not using Kerberized Hadoop. The call is transparent if the authentication is already done or the Hadoop cluster in use is not using Kerberos. We also slightly refactored the signature of `JobHelper#authenticate` after intelliJ flagged the config parameter as being unused.\r\n\r\nWith all this being said, I'm not sure if calling into the `authenticate` method from a different module is frowned upon as far as design goes. I decided to reuse that method and see what the community had to say about that.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable?

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds new integration tests for stream ingestion against different data formats. To do this, a new interface `EventSerializer` was added which converts generated events using `SyntheticStreamGenerator` into a particular data format.\r\n\r\nThe new tests automatically pick up serializer, inputFormat, and inputRowParser specs from test resources and populate test parameters. Since these tests take about 30 mins when you run in parallel with 2 threads, a new Travis job was added.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

This should have computeLeftRequiresSubquery return true and having cost of >1e5. However, saw that computeLeftRequiresSubquery can returns differently depending on which child we pick from the list of RelList. This then result in a very very different cost since a child that resulted in requiring subquery will have very high cost and a child that doesn't will have a much lower cost. In this case, I saw two RelNode in the list. One RelNode has a filter = null and the other has \"filter\":{\"type\":\"selector\",\"dimension\":\"v\",\"value\":\"xa\",\"extractionFn\":null}. The function getSomeDruidChild happens to return the first RelNode with filter=null resulting in computeLeftRequiresSubquery returning false. \r\n\r\nCalcite only guarantee that all the rel nodes in each rel subset are logically equivalent. Technically, the two rel in the rel subset I found are logically equivalent relational algebra wise. Our self cost join for join in  DruidJoinQueryRel.computeSelfCostmake further assumption outside of relational algebra equivalency. We determine cost base on the location of filter (if filter is on the node vs filter is in the node’s child)\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nSince Druid cannot reliably push up / push down filters smartly (pushing up is NOT always the best and pushing down is NOT always the best but Druid is not smart enough to figure this out), this PR disabled pushing down predicates (condition and filter) pass a Join (i.e. into Join's children) altogether. Hence, Druid now only supports pushing predicates into the join if they originated from above the join. Basically, the location of predicates and filters in your Druid SQL is very important as that will directly translate to where the it ends up in the calcite best plan / native SQL. \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

is a refactor and update of the Druid Quickstart.\r\n\r\nIt moves the [data loader tutorial](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/tutorial-batch.html#loading-data-with-the-data-loader) into the Quickstart, while updating its layout, format, and text, to have a more complete, substantial quickstart.\r\n\r\nScreenshots in the Quickstart and in [Tutorial: Loading a file](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/tutorial-batch.html) have been updated to 0.18.0.\r\n\r\nThis leaves [Tutorial: Loading a

\"Tutorial: Loading a file\" that will substantially reorganize them.  \r\n\r\nThis PR will introduce some formatting differences between the quickstart and other tutorials, but those can be made to be consistent incrementally, keeping consistency among pages in the major sections.

Description\r\nThis PR fixes an issue with `CloseableIterator.flatMap` does not ensure any inner `CloseableIterator` it creates during iteration is closed when it's own `close` method is explicitly called. I noticed this looking into the `TimedShutoffInputSourceReader`, after noticing if I set a breakpoint at a particular place that an underlying s3 file stream was not being closed when the timeout occurred. Looking closer, this also occurs with the last inner iterator of the call to `flatMap`, which is also not closed. The `flatMap` test has been modified to ensure that close is called on all closeable iterators, and fails prior to the changes of this PR. The added test also covers the case when the outer iterator is closed early.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

\"waiting for tasks complete\" logic in integration tests\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, the \"waiting for tasks complete\" logic in integration tests waits for all tasks regardless of the datasource of those tasks. This should never be use in integration test since integration test should be self contained, know which datasources it is testing/managing and only wait for those particular datasource(s)' tasks to complete. The previous logic of waiting for all tasks regardless of the datasource have two problem:\r\n1) If integration tests are run in parallel (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/integration-tests/README.md#running-test-methods-in-parallel), then the old logic can be waiting (and failing from) tasks of unrelated integration tests.\r\n2) if other random integration tests fail to clean up properly (such as leaving a long running task or a supervisor running), then other integration test using the old logic can fail mysteriously (from task that has no relation with current test method or test class at all)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ]

PR fixes a bug where rollup can fail to happen during segment merging when multivalue string dimensions are used.\r\n\r\nThe included unit test shows how to trigger the bug:\r\n\r\nIn one segment, I have the following two rows:\r\n```\r\n{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 4]} | {sumCount=1}\r\n{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 3, 5]} | {sumCount=1}\r\n```\r\nIn a second segment, I have the following two rows:\r\n```\r\n{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 4]} | {sumCount=1}\r\n{dimA=potato, dimMultiVal=[0, 1, 4]} | {sumCount=1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrior to this patch, merging these two segments with rollup enabled results in a segment with 4 rows:\r\n```\r\n{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 4]} | {sumCount=1}\r\n{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 3, 5]} | {sumCount=1}\r\n{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 4]} | {sumCount=1}\r\n{dimA=potato, dimMultiVal=[0, 1, 4]} | {sumCount=1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis bug occurs because the comparator used by `TimeAndDimsPointer` during segment merging (from `DimensionHandler::getEncodedValueSelectorComparator` which is `StringDimensionHandler.DIMENSION_SELECTOR_COMPARATOR` for String dimensions) has different logic from the comparator used in `OnHeapIncrementaIndex`. The latter uses `StringDimensionIndexer.compareUnsortedEncodedKeyComponents`.\r\n\r\nAs a result, using the example rows above, the priority queue in `MergingRowIterator` would first return `{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 4]} | {sumCount=1}` from the first segment. Afterwards, the first segment's iterator would present the row `{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 3, 5]} | {sumCount=1}`, and the second segment's iterator would present the row `{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 4]} | {sumCount=1}`.\r\n\r\n`StringDimensionHandler.DIMENSION_SELECTOR_COMPARATOR` before this PR considers `{dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 3, 5]}` to precede `dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 4]} | {sumCount=1}`, so rollup fails to happen for the `dimA=leek, dimMultiVal=[1, 2, 4]} | {sumCount=1}` row.\r\n\r\nThis PR takes the approach of adjusting `StringDimensionHandler.DIMENSION_SELECTOR_COMPARATOR` to follow how `StringDimensionIndexer.getUnsortedEncodedValueFromSorted` behaves. The two comparison methods are also updated to specifically have a check that considers null and empty list to be equal.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-22T04:00:34Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T04:20:57Z","closed_at":"2020-04-25T20:47:09Z","merged_at":"2020-04-25T20:47:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"fe000a9e4bf1d2681760f72e9c593bd2aa5a1416","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR changes `ColumnCapabilites.hasMultipleValues()` to be a `Capable` enum added in #9662, and removes `ColumnCapabilities.isComplete()` which was added in #7588, along with some slight refactoring of `ColumnCapabilitiesImpl`, to remove the `merge` method, which was only setting `isComplete`, and replacing it with a static method `ColumnCapabilities.complete` which is used at index merger time to finalize `Capable.UNKNOWN` values.\r\n\r\nMany uses in the query path of `ColumnCapabilites.hasMultipleValues` use a new `Capable` method, `isMaybeTrue` to check for either `TRUE` or `UNKNOWN`.\r\n\r\n~~This PR also removes the artificial, always multi-value `ColumnCapabilites` that currently are provided by `IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter`, and fixes up some of the fall-out from that. Part of this included adding a new method to `DimensionIndexer` to let a column indexer know if it is missing values for any row, to fix up an issue where `nameLookupPossibleInAdvance` would report true but the dictionary would only contain values for present rows and had not added an explicit null, which is called by `IncrementalIndexer` when processing a row.~~\r\n\r\nInstead of ^, this PR adds a method `IncrementalIndexStorageAdapter.getSnapshotColumnCapabilities`, which allows `SegmentAnalyzer` to get the 'at the time of asking' capabilities of the underlying `IncrementalIndex`. The fixes for if we used these at query time are still in place, but I opted to modify this behavior to use the correct capabilities for a future patch, which also needs to build a selector with these capabilities instead of using the 'live' state of the `StringDimensionIndexer` which could unexpectedly provide multi-value responses.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  /**\r\n   * This method will be called whenever a known dimension is absent in a row to allow an indexer\r\n   * to account for any missing rows. Useful so that a {@link DimensionSelector} built on top of an\r\n   * {@link IncrementalIndex} may accurately report {@link DimensionSelector#nameLookupPossibleInAdvance()}.\r\n   *\r\n   * At index persist/merge time all missing columns for a row will be explicitly replaced with the value appropriate\r\n   * null or default value.\r\n   */\r\n  default void setSparseIndexed()\r\n  {\r\n    // no-op, only implement this if the dimension needs to perform any special handling for absent rows\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, it fixes an issue in `IndexMergerV9` where we were using `computeIfAbsent` instead of `compute` in `mergeCapabilities`, meaning instead of merging capabilities we were just taking the first capabilities encountered. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

tests for reading from empty kafka/kinesis partitions\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAdd tests for reading from empty kafka/kinesis partitions. The new tests discovers that Kafka is working fine when reading from empty kafka partitions, and thus, supervisor shows healthy and tasks are running without failing when one or more partition is empty (as tested in KafkaRecordSupplierTest.java). However, Kinesis supervisor is showing unhealthy and task are not running when one or more partition is empty. This should be fix in a separate PR and subsequently these tests for Kinesis will have to be modify.\r\n\r\nNote that there is no problem when index task is running and polling from kafka/kinesis stream with one or more empty shards (as tested in KafkaIndexTaskTest.java and KinesisIndexTaskTest.java). The problem for Kinesis described above is when we try to get the sequence number in SeekableStreamSupervisor#getOffsetFromStorageForPartition and Kinesis has one or more empty shard (as tested in KinesisRecordSupplierTest.java and SeekableStreamSupervisorStateTest.java). More specifically, this happens for the following conditions:\r\n- we don't have a startingOffset (first run or we had some previous failures and reset the sequences) and don't have offset in metadata store so we retrieve the latest or earliest Kinesis sequence\r\n- we don't have a startingOffset (first run or we had some previous failures and reset the sequences) and we have offset in metadata store but skipSequenceNumberAvailabilityCheck=False\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ]

#9380 \r\n\r\n**Note: This is a work-in-progress PR with the goal of eliciting feedback, it is not intended to be merged as-is.**\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to introduce fine grained config and state resources for better access controls.\r\n\r\nThe pull request follows the schema of STATE/CONFIG permissions laid out by @pjain1 in the following document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fXD5n9gHIL0RbAoiFnu9s_2So2c2K4W8dtQZVeCaux8/edit?pli=1#gid=0\r\n\r\nTo make this work properly, this PR introduces several new filters in `server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/http/security`, and alters the existing `ConfigResourceFilter` and `StateResourceFilter` classes:\r\n\r\n* `ConfigResourceFilter` can still be used in places where the ResourceName \"CONFIG\" is required. Additional filter classes have been introduced for Config ResourceNames such as \"WORKER\" and \"LOOKUP\". All of these new filter classes are named with the prefix \"Config\" to make clear that these are config filters specifically. \r\n* `StateResourceFilter` has been made abstract, since the resource name \"STATE\" is no longer used. Several new State filters now inherit from this class, to avoid duplicating logic. As with the config filters, these new state filters are named with the prefix \"State\".\r\n\r\nThe above filters have been applied at all endpoints described in @pjain1's aforementioned document.\r\n\r\nTo avoid hardcoding and repetition of resource name strings such as \"COMPACTION\", \"CONFIG\" etc throughout the code, this PR also introduces the class `server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/security/ResourceName.java`, which denotes a resource name, and contains all the required `final` resource names in one class. For safety and convenience, these `static final` ResourceNames should always be used instead of hardcoding strings into the code.\r\n\r\nThe class `server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/server/security/Resource.java` has also been altered to use this new ResourceName class instead of a simple string as its `name` property.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n\r\n* `ConfigResourceFilter`\r\n*

integration tests for kafka ingestion\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the same coverage of integration test for Kafka as what we already have for Kinesis. \r\nJust to remind everyone...the coverage of integration test for Kafka and Kinesis we have now are:\r\n\r\n1. Functional tests when Druid and Kafka/Kinesis are in stable state\r\n- legacy parser\r\n- inputFormat\r\n- Greater than 1 taskCount\r\n\r\n2. Functional tests when Druid is in an unstable state \r\n- losing nodes\r\n- Stop/start supervisor\r\n\r\n3. Functional tests when Kafka/Kinesis is in an unstable state \r\n- adding partitions\r\n- removing partitions (This is only for Kinesis as we cannot decrease partition for kafka)\r\n\r\nTo verify ingestion:\r\n- Kafka/Kinesis lag should be minimal, the consumer should be able to pull off the queue at a comparable rate to the producer.\r\n- Realtime queries works from the indexing tasks\r\n- Queries works reading from historical segments (after handed off)\r\n- Queries return expected count/value/etc.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for Kafka we have the above set of coverage for both when Kafka producer has transaction enabled and transaction disabled. Note that this PR includes all existing Kafka integration tests for Kafka. The original tests and the location of the new test methods after this PR refactoring are:\r\n- transaction enabled + legacy parser is now in ITKafkaIndexingServiceTransactionalParallelizedTest#testKafkaIndexDataWithLegacyParserStableState\r\n- transaction disabled + legacy parser is now in ITKafkaIndexingServiceNonTransactionalParallelizedTest#testKafkaIndexDataWithLegacyParserStableState\r\n- transaction enabled + inputFormat parser is now in ITKafkaIndexingServiceTransactionalParallelizedTest#testKafkaIndexDataWithInputFormatStableState\r\n- transaction disabled + inputFormat parser is now in ITKafkaIndexingServiceNonTransactionalParallelizedTest#testKafkaIndexDataWithInputFormatStableState\r\n\r\nOther important change in this PR...\r\n- KinesisAdminClient - Create stream, delete stream, etc. for Kafka\r\n- KafkaEventWriter - Wrapper around Kafka producer for generating test data\r\n- Added useful mvn command flags for integration tests development and debugging\r\n- Added the framework/functionality for easily enabling certain test classes/packages to be run in parallel (use testng parallel framework by executing multiple test methods concurrently using multiple threads). This is added in this PR as all the Kafka integration tests (new+old) when run serially takes 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes. Without the parallel functionality, the kafka-index test groups will be the bottleneck our travis CI. Also, splitting up kafka-index doesn't really make sense as logically they are testing the same functionality. (Note: tests take long time due to lots of idle time such as waiting for supervisor to come up after restart, druid node to come up after restart, ingestion tasks to ingest data after insert into stream, etc.)\r\n    - Upgraded testng to 6.14.3 due to testng bug for parallel test execution in the version we were using (https://github.com/cbeust/testng/issues/1660)\r\n    - Added a new test tag in integration-tests/src/test/resources/testng.xml for including tests that can be run in parallel.\r\n    - Removed DruidTestRunnerFactory and moved the setup/teardown logic into SuiteListener. The runner is executed for each test tag while the SuiteListener is executed for each suites. We do not want the teardown to happen after the first test tag as the second test tag will fail to run. (we now have two test tag, the serialized tests and the parallelized tests).\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-19T04:15:20Z","updated_at":"2020-04-22T17:51:28Z","closed_at":"2020-04-22T17:43:35Z","merged_at":"2020-04-22T17:43:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"16f5ae440510951b247920d41833da98804897d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

Description\r\n\r\nIn the `FileWriteOutBytes#writeInt(int)` method, the argument passed to `flushIfNeeded()` is `Integer.SIZE` while the `Integer.BYTES` should be used.  \r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\nThis bug will incur one extra file write operation in some cases.  For example, if we would like to write 4 KB of ints using `FileWriteOutBytes#writeInt(int)`, the `flush()` method will be called twice.  After fixing this bug, the `flush()` method will be called only one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover

PR adds a new set of Hadoop integration tests (not run in Travis CI in this PR).\r\n- Added Hadoop counterpart to the native batch wikipedia test, with variations on the partitioning spec. This reads from HDFS and writes to HDFS. The original `ITHadoopIndexTest` is preserved as a test within the revised class.\r\n- Added tests for Hadoop ingestion + cloud stores (Azure, GCS, S3).\r\n  - Note that using Azure as deep storage with Hadoop 2.8.5 ingestion does not currently work due to conflicts in the `azure-storage` version that Druid uses (8.6.0) and the one that `hadoop-azure` uses (2.2.0). Reading files from Azure works.\r\n\r\nSome other changes included in this PR:\r\n- Enables the management proxy on the main router service, which makes it easier to troubleshoot the integration tests live using the web console\r\n- Removes an unneeded `-sha256` parameter from the `openssl genrsa` calls, which was causing problems in my environment with a newer openssl that rejects the unrecognized parameter\r\n- Allows setting `extra.datasource.name.suffix` for the integration tests, which is needed for these tests as our cloud store extensions currently don't handle the special characters in the datasource names properly.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml)\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths.\r\n- [x] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-16T11:13:27Z","updated_at":"2020-06-26T04:18:38Z","closed_at":"2020-04-30T21:33:02Z","merged_at":"2020-04-30T21:33:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"61295bd00262d10a57f38a4c18add412dc85ceb5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area
