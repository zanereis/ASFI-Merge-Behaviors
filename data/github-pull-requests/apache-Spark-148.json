field of `ClassData` (Ints).\r\nThe row `ClassData(\"a\", 1)` on the left side of the join has no matching row on the right side of the join as there is no row with value `1` for field `b`.\r\nThe missing value (of Row type) is represented as a `GenericRowWithSchema(Array(null, null), rightFieldSchema)` instead of a `null` value making the test fail.\r\n\r\nThis new test is identical to [this one](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/6061e60ed7691bf3ca0e0964acac4c53c69bcc07/sql/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/DatasetSuite.scala#L1269-L1292) and only differs in that it uses DataFrames instead of Datasets.\r\n\r\nI've run unit tests for the `sql-core` and `sql-catalyst` submodules locally with `./build/mvn clean package -pl sql/core,cql/catalyst`","created_at":"2022-01-07T18:52:17Z","updated_at":"2022-04-29T00:18:18Z","closed_at":"2022-04-29T00:18:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dadac77e11a9c93448702370fa8a61beb3fd65b2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35139/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35139/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35139/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3831f769b588f4deb49fe8a4fdad78f35cc995d5","head":{"label":"cdegroc:SPARK-37829","ref":"SPARK-37829","sha":"3831f769b588f4deb49fe8a4fdad78f35cc995d5","user":{"login":"cdegroc","id":1451981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTE5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1451981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc","html_url":"https://github.com/cdegroc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444848561,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoPZsQ","name":"spark","full_name":"cdegroc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cdegroc","id":1451981,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NTE5ODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1451981?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc","html_url":"https://github.com/cdegroc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cdegroc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cdegroc/spark","description":"Apache

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32875 . Basically https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/32875 did two improvements:\r\n1. allow bucket join even if the bucket hash function is different from Spark's shuffle hash function\r\n2. allow bucket join even if the hash partition keys are subset of join keys.\r\n\r\nThe first improvement is the major target for implementing the SPIP \"storage partition join\". The second improvement is kind of a consequence of the framework refactor, which is not planned.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to disable the second improvement by default, which may introduce perf regression if there are data skew without shuffle. We need more designs to enable this improvement, like checking the ndv.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently in the tests, `TaskContext.getPartitionId()` is called at driver side, so the sleep interval is always 100ms, which is not expected and makes some tests flaky (on my env it's mainly the test `\"verify that an already running task which is going to cache data succeeds on a decommissioned executor after one task ends but before job ends\"`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nCorrect the test logic and make tests stable.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nBy existing tests. I also iterated 10 times on the env where the test was flaky, after the change it never

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n- Add `LogicalQueryStage(_, agg: BaseAggregateExec)` check in `AQEPropagateEmptyRelation`\r\n- Add `LeafNode` check in `PropagateEmptyRelationBase`, so we can eliminate `LogicalQueryStage` to `LocalRelation`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThe Aggregate in AQE is different with others, the `LogicalQueryStage` looks like `LogicalQueryStage(Aggregate, BaseAggregate)`. We should handle this case specially.\r\n\r\nLogically, if the Aggregate grouping expression is not empty, we can eliminate it safely.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIn the comment https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35117#issuecomment-1007171965 in #35117 and other details, we noticed that the BasicWriteTaskStatsTracker keeps complaining that some of the written files are missing. This is truely worrisome.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.range(0, 3, 1, 4).write.option(\"compression\", \"zstd\").orc(\"./spark-warehouse/zstd_1\")\r\n22/01/07 14:22:48 WARN BasicWriteTaskStatsTracker: Expected 1 files, but only saw 0. This could be due to the output format not writing empty files, or files being not immediately visible in the filesystem.\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThis happens for ORC format and the root cause is because, in OrcOutputWriter, the `recordWriter` and the `file` are lazily generated once have a record to write. So this step is skipped when the records iterator is empty. In the `commit` part, we will use the `file` to update stats assuming it exists. This causes `FileNotFoundException` and results not stats update. Then, `numSubmittedFiles` and `numFiles` become inconsistent and issue a false warning like above.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we make the hive.OrcOutputWriter and OrcFileFormat behave the same as other data sources. That said, it will always create a file even when there are no records at all. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nfix a regression\r\n- the warning is wrong\r\n- make builtin data sources behave same\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`max`，`min`，`count`，`sum`，`avg` are the most commonly used aggregation functions.\r\nCurrently, DS V2 supports complete aggregate push-down of `avg`. But, supports partial aggregate push-down of `avg` is very useful.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate push-down algorithm is:\r\n\r\n1. Spark translates group expressions of `Aggregate` to DS V2 `Aggregation`.\r\n2. Spark calls `supportCompletePushDown` to check if it can completely push down aggregate.\r\n3. If `supportCompletePushDown` returns true, we preserves the aggregate expressions as final aggregate expressions. Otherwise, we split `AVG` into 2 functions: `SUM` and `COUNT`.\r\n4. Spark translates final aggregate expressions and group expressions of `Aggregate` to DS V2 `Aggregation` again, and pushes the `Aggregation` to JDBC source.\r\n5. Spark constructs the final aggregate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nDS V2 supports partial aggregate push-down `AVG`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'Yes'. DS V2 could partial aggregate push-down `AVG`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-07T08:43:25Z","updated_at":"2022-01-20T09:59:53Z","closed_at":"2022-01-20T04:13:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"dc16ec087ff3fe890c37b295ed862180cc352dbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35130/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35130/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35130/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d41aeb0e2fe0ab2a46a65b6693c823a35c86a68d","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-37839","ref":"SPARK-37839","sha":"d41aeb0e2fe0ab2a46a65b6693c823a35c86a68d","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to enable flake8 rules as below:\r\n\r\n- [F841](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/F841.html): Local variable name is assigned to but never used\r\n- [E722](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E722.html): Do not use bare except, specify exception instead\r\n- [E305](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E305.html): Expected 2 blank lines after end of function or class\r\n- [E226](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E226.html):  Missing whitespace around arithmetic operator\r\n\r\nWe should probably still enable the rules below:\r\n\r\n- [E731](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E731.html): Do not assign a lambda expression, use a def\r\n- [E741](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/E741.html): Do not use variables named 'I', 'O', or 'l' \r\n- [W503](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W503.html): Line break occurred before a binary operator\r\n- [W504](https://www.flake8rules.com/rules/W504.html): Line break occurred after a binary operator\r\n\r\nbut the rules ^ are not enabled in this PR because:\r\n- There are too many instances to fix. Maybe it's better to separate PRs\r\n- Some require real code changes.\r\n- W503 and W504 are sort of conflicted. We should investigate a bit more.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo comply PEP 8.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested it Python linter.","created_at":"2022-01-07T06:13:09Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:53:59Z","closed_at":"2022-01-07T14:44:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a3621713476ced701cff6e0de998af709196b421","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange the Orc struct converter to index an array rather than a linked list when looking up field converters.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the OrcSerializer's struct converter uses an index to look up each field converter in a linked list, resulting in a n*(n/2) average complexity per row (where n is the field count).\r\n\r\nSimply converting the linked list to an array brings performance gains, especially for wide structs.\r\n\r\n| field count | row count | master | pr    | improvement |\r\n| ----------- |

If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, we build the beeline command with SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY only and are not able to set extra java opts. Besides, the beeline is not a DRIVER-type thing.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we add \r\n\r\n```java\r\n# - SPARK_BEELINE_OPTS, to set config properties only for the beeline cli (e.g. \"-Dx=y\")\r\n# - SPARK_BEELINE_MEMORY, Memory for beeline (e.g. 1000M, 2G) (Default: 1G)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nMake spark beeline  configurable for extra JVM settings, like GC \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nyes, add 2 environment variables.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

If the renewable delegationTokenProvider returns None, changes the result renewal time  to the current time + delay（sparkconf  spark.security.credentials.retryWait）.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nHadoopFSDelegationTokenProvider.obtaindelegationtokens returns None when an exception is encountered. HadoopDelegationTokenProvider that cannot be renewed also returns None. If the obtaindelegationtokens of all HadoopDelegationTokenProvider return None,HadoopDelegationTokenManager in obtaindelegationtokens, call foldleft (long. Maxvalue) (math. Min) to return long.MaxValue. Therefore, the log shows \"scheduling renewal in 1921535501304.2 H\"\r\nAt this time, HadoopFSDelegationToken cannot be renewed in time, resulting in throw \"hdfs_delete_token not found in cache\" Exception\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nFor testability, modify the method obtaindelegationtokens  protected and modify the  parameters.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes to use V2 commands as default as outlined in [SPARK-36588](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-36588), and this PR migrates `CREATE NAMESPACE` to use v2 command by default.\r\n\r\nNote that the work to tests covering both v1/v2 were done in #35093.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's been a while since we introduced the v2 commands,  and it seems reasonable to use v2 commands by default even for the session catalog, with a legacy config to fall back to the v1 commands.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThe error message will be slightly different if namespace already exists when v2 command is run against v1 catalog:\r\nv1 command: `Database 'db' already exists\"`\r\nvs.\r\nv2 command: `Namespace 'db' already exists\"`\r\n\r\nAlso, the error message will be slightly different if namespace already exists when v1 command is run against Hive catalog:\r\nBefore: `Database db already exists\"`\r\nvs.\r\nAfter: `Database 'db' already exists\"`\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting *CreateNamespaceSuite tests cover this PR's change.","created_at":"2022-01-06T05:45:13Z","updated_at":"2022-01-11T14:44:58Z","closed_at":"2022-01-11T14:44:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f5be20062350290417651401edfa64e2cb920ad8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35113/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35113/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35113/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/044d7e548fc13d11be41187ac1a3148a09161489","head":{"label":"imback82:migrate_create_namespace","ref":"migrate_create_namespace","sha":"044d7e548fc13d11be41187ac1a3148a09161489","user":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":190453549,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTA0NTM1NDk=","name":"spark-4","full_name":"imback82/spark-4","private":false,"owner":{"login":"imback82","id":12103644,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTAzNjQ0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12103644?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82","html_url":"https://github.com/imback82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/imback82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/imback82/spark-4","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add `is-changed.py` dev script to reuse in CIs for various purposes in the future.\r\nTo do that, file change detection codes are moved into a new file, `dev/utils.py`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ dev/is-changed.py -h\r\nusage: is-changed [-h] [-f] [-m MODULES]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  -f, --fail            Exit with 1 if there is no relevant change.\r\n  -m MODULES, --modules MODULES\r\n                        A comma-separated list of modules to test (default:

are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis can be used in CI to save the community resources.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a dev-only test script change.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis should pass the existing CIs.\r\n\r\nThe following is a manual test.\r\n```\r\n$ APACHE_SPARK_REF=HEAD dev/is-changed.py         \r\nfalse\r\n\r\n$ APACHE_SPARK_REF=08dd010860 dev/is-changed.py        \r\ntrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also supports `module` arguments to check the required modules exactly.\r\n```\r\n$ git diff HEAD~1

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, `split` [returns the data type](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/08dd010860cc176a33073928f4c0780d0ee98a08/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/regexpExpressions.scala#L532) `ArrayType(StringType)` which means the resultant array can contain nullable elements. However I do not see any case where the array can contain nulls.\r\n\r\nIn the case where either the provided string or delimiter is `NULL`, the output will be a `NULL` array. In case of empty string or no chars between delemiters, the output array will contain empty strings but never `NULL`s. So I propose we change the return type of `split` to mark elements as non-null.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProvides a more accurate return type for `split`\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, schema for queries using `split` will change to show an array of non-null elements.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTrivial change. Manually tested with Spark shell\r\n```\r\nscala> spark.sql(\"SELECT split('a,b,c', ',')\").printSchema\r\nroot\r\n |-- split(a,b,c, ,, -1): array (nullable = false)\r\n |    |-- element: string (containsNull = false)\r\n```\r\n I can't think of a better test case than just testing `StringSplit().dataType == Array(StringType, containsNull = false)` at which point, it is just duplicating the actual definition of `StringSplit`.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-06T03:45:03Z","updated_at":"2022-01-06T18:57:47Z","closed_at":"2022-01-06T07:51:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"71e3bccc8fe625e755dcb8af6a9d978bbbceb8dd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35111/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35111/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35111/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/152fc146add4d2e7c732edd194949287ff12c60c","head":{"label":"shardulm94:spark-37822","ref":"spark-37822","sha":"152fc146add4d2e7c732edd194949287ff12c60c","user":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":304161240,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDQxNjEyNDA=","name":"spark","full_name":"shardulm94/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shardulm94","id":6961317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY5NjEzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6961317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94","html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shardulm94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shardulm94/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add a new executor roll policy, `OUTLIER`, which aims to detect various outliers first, and use it by default.\r\nIf there is no outlier, it will work like `TOTAL_DURATION` policy.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe users can use `OUTLIER` policy to consider the outliers in terms of multiple dimensions.\r\nIn addition, this will be a better default policy.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a new feature in Apache Spark 3.3.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe constructor of GetArrayItem and GetMapValue with two input elements are not actually used. Usually, we implement such construction method so that it can be used in FunctionRegistry\r\n```\r\ndef this(child: Expression, ordinal: Expression) = this(child, ordinal, SQLConf.get.ansiEnabled)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the expression GetArrayItem and GetMapValue are not used as functions in FunctionRegistry, we can remove these constructors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/35084 that removes duplicated `LogicalPlan` inheritance because `LeafNode` always inherits `LogicalPlan`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make the codes easier to read and less error-prone. e.g., if we switch `LeafNode` to an abstract class like `LogicalPlan` the complication fails.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this is the only `LeafNode` instance in the current codebase that duplicately inherits `LogicalPlan`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, virtually no-op for now.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test cases should cover.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-05T09:08:22Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:54:02Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T11:08:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"663270362cee5701dcc9ebf05d5b4777076ac0e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35105/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35105/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35105/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f36dec5c102a4f531f908f57b2083ca402eb38f9","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-37800","ref":"SPARK-37800","sha":"f36dec5c102a4f531f908f57b2083ca402eb38f9","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark aggregate pushdown will translate some standard aggregate functions, so that compile these functions to adapt specify database.\r\nAfter this job, users could override `JdbcDialect.compileAggregate` to implement some standard aggregate functions supported by some database.\r\nThis PR just translate the ANSI standard aggregate functions. The mainstream database supports these functions show below:\r\n| Name | ClickHouse | Presto | Teradata | Snowflake | Oracle | Postgresql | Vertica | MySQL | RedShift | ElasticSearch | Impala | Druid | SyBase | DB2 | H2 | Exasol | Mariadb | Phoenix | Yellowbrick | Singlestore | Influxdata | Dolphindb | Intersystems |\r\n|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\r\n| `VAR_POP` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |\r\n| `VAR_SAMP` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |  Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |\r\n| `STDDEV_POP` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| `STDDEV_SAMP` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |  Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes |\r\n| `COVAR_POP` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | No |  Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | No |\r\n| `COVAR_SAMP` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | No |  Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | No | No |\r\n| `CORR` | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | No |  Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | Yes | No |\r\n\r\nBecause some aggregate functions will be converted by Optimizer show below, this PR no need to match them.\r\n\r\n|Input|Parsed|Optimized|\r\n|------|--------------------|----------|\r\n|`Every`| `aggregate.BoolAnd` |`Min`|\r\n|`Any`| `aggregate.BoolOr` |`Max`|\r\n|`Some`| `aggregate.BoolOr` |`Max`|\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMake the implement of `*Dialect` could extends the aggregate functions by override `JdbcDialect.compileAggregate`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support a new configuration to support the minimum number of tasks per executor before being selected as the executor rolling target.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nNewly created executors might have a long initial setup time during its initial tasks.\r\nIn this case, some rolling policies like `AVERAGE_DURATION` might kill those newly created executors.\r\nThis PR aims to protect newly created executors until `totalTasks` reaches the minimum number of tasks.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. The default value is 0.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSPARK-37795 add a scalastyle rule to ban `org.apache.log4j` imports, but there is still one place to retain the imports of `org.apache.log4j` in `o.a.spark.TestUtils`.\r\n\r\nThis pr refactor `configTestLog4j` method in `o.a.spark.TestUtils` to use log4j2 api and let the log behavior using log4j2.x be the same as that using log4j1.x before. In fact, the `configTestLog4j` method behavior before this pr is invalid because `PropertyConfigurator.configure` method in `org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-1.2-api` is an empty method as follows:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/blob/491a0b3787975b6fc95b6a8cb3da76dc7517c65f/log4j-1.2-api/src/main/java/org/apache/log4j/PropertyConfigurator.java#L39-L47\r\n\r\nAnother change of this pr is rename the method name from `configTestLog4j`  to `configTestLog4j2`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up the `org.apache.log4j` imports left in Spark internal and let `configTestLog4j` method behavior keep consistent between log4j1.x and log4j2.x.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe  `configTestLog4j` method in `TestUtils` rename to `configTestLog4j2`\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- Pass the Jenkins or GitHub Action\r\n- Manual test\r\n\r\nRun the test cases using `configTestLog4j` method in the following 3 scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. without this pr to test log4j2.x\r\n2. with this pr to test log4j2.x\r\n3. run `git reset --hard 19227983e91a54b5f27ade6412dad1088dfcba9e` to test log4j1.x\r\n\r\nFor example `WholeStageCodegenSparkSubmitSuite`, run \r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install -DskipTests -pl sql/core -am\r\nmvn test -pl sql/core -Dtest=none -DwildcardSuites=org.apache.spark.sql.execution.WholeStageCodegenSparkSubmitSuite\r\n```\r\n\r\nScenario 1 does not print any logs to the console, scenario 2 and scenario 3 will print similar logs to the console\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-04T09:25:53Z","updated_at":"2023-10-22T07:43:50Z","closed_at":"2022-01-13T00:11:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5eb61b36f9332a1ea8786c160a1b7b4f7f13f836","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35095/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35095/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35095/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8d0a078f4254498a68d90502c9e1c58c0ef5fe91","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:refactor-configTestLog4j","ref":"refactor-configTestLog4j","sha":"8d0a078f4254498a68d90502c9e1c58c0ef5fe91","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n1. Move `CREATE NAMESPACE` parsing tests to `CreateNamespaceParserSuite`.\r\n2. Put common `CREATE NAMESPACE` tests into one trait `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.command.CreateNamespaceSuiteBase`, and put datasource specific tests to the `v1.CreateNamespaceSuite` and `v2.CreateNamespaceSuite`.\r\n\r\nThe changes follow the approach of #30287.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n1. The unification will allow to run common `CREATE NAMESPACE` tests for both DSv1/Hive DSv1 and DSv2\r\n2. We can detect missing features and differences between DSv1 and DSv2 implementations.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\n-->\r\nExisting unit tests and new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent StreamingQueryListener only support add constructor parameter of SparkConf, but if we  start a SparkContext first, many SQL conf won't be applied to SparkContext's SparkConf.\r\nAlso it's a SQL component,  related configuration we defined it as SQLConf. But it's hard to use SQLConf in this plugin listener.\r\n\r\nThis patch, we use pass SQLConf to `StreamingQueryManager ` and use `SQLConf.withExistingConf` to wrap the passed `SQLConf`. Then we can use `SQLConf.get` to get the same SQLConf of `SessionState` when initializing `StreamingQueryListener`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPass corresponding SessionState's SQLConf to `StreamingQueryListener`. Then user can use SQLConf.get to use the  SQLConf.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can use `StreamingQueryListener` with corresponding `SessionState`'s `SQLConf`. For example\r\n```\r\nprivate class SQLConfStreamingQueryListener extends StreamingQueryListener {\r\n  val sqlConf = SQLConf.get\r\n  override def onSuccess(funcName: String, qe: QueryExecution, durationNs: Long): Unit = {\r\n  }\r\n  override def onFailure(funcName: String, qe: QueryExecution, exception: Exception): Unit = {\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen deserializing an Orc struct, reuse the result row when possible.\r\n\r\nWhen the struct's parent is itself a struct, it is safe to reuse the result row, since some code (an ancestor of the parent, or some downstream processing) has already copied the parent's result row, and therefore our result row.\r\n\r\nWhen the parent is a map or array, it is not safe to reuse the result row, because each element of the parent will point to the same result row. In this case, we must copy the result row before updating the parent.\r\n\r\nNote, it is safe to reuse the result row even when the parent is a struct but the grandparent is a map or array, because the parent will copy its result row for each element of the grandparent (and thus copy our result row).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis change speeds up deserialization of records containing Orc structs.\r\n\r\n| struct size | master | pr    | improvement  |\r\n| ----------- | ------ | ----- | ---------    |\r\n| 10 fields   | 1463   | 296   | 4.94 times\r\n| 100 fields  | 11818  | 2391  | 4.94 times |\r\n| 300 fields  | 38938  | 8061  | 4.8 times |\r\n| 600 fields  | 86735  | 30505 | 2.8 times |\r\n\r\nThe benchmark results for the PR are included in the PR. The benchmark results for master (with the new benchmark added) are [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13038214/master_results.txt).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n No.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- New unit tests to check correctness (since sometimes the result row is reused, and sometimes it is not).\r\n- New

backlisted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI observed when the AM is out of sync with ResourceManager, or RM is having issue report back with current number of available NMs, something like below happens:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n20/05/13 09:01:21 INFO RetryInvocationHandler: java.io.EOFException: End of File Exception between local host is: \"client.zyx.com/x.x.x.124\"; destination host is: \"rm.zyx.com\":8030; : java.io.EOFException; For more details see:  http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/EOFException, while invoking ApplicationMasterProtocolPBClientImpl.allocate over rm543. Trying to failover immediately.\r\n...\r\n20/05/13 09:01:28 WARN AMRMClientImpl: ApplicationMaster is out of sync with ResourceManager, hence resyncing.\r\n...\r\n\r\nthen the spark job would suddenly run into AllNodeBlacklisted state:\r\n...\r\n20/05/13 09:01:31 INFO ApplicationMaster: Final app status: FAILED, exitCode: 11, (reason: Due to executor failures all available nodes are blacklisted)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut actually there's no black listed nodes in currentBlacklistedYarnNodes, and I do not see any blacklisting message from:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/resource-managers/yarn/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/deploy/yarn/YarnAllocatorBlacklistTracker.scala#L119\r\n\r\nWe should only return isAllNodeBlacklisted =true when we see there are >0  numClusterNodes AND 'currentBlacklistedYarnNodes.size >= numClusterNodes'.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nA minor change. No changes on tests.\r\n\r\nCloses #28606 from cnZach/false_AllNodeBlacklisted_when_RM_is_having_issue.\r\n\r\nAuthored-by: Yuexin Zhang <zach.yx.zhang@gmail.com>\r\nSigned-off-by: Sean Owen

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n- Remove temporary workaround in run-tests\r\n- Move the workaround to python/run-tests.py\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs the note mentioned:\r\n> Python 3.9 was temporarily removed as its default Python executables to test because of Jenkins environment issue. Once Jenkins has Python 3.9 to test, we should remove this change back and add python3.9 into python/run-tests.py script.\r\n\r\nThis cleanup will also help to user only run python/run-tests.py with `python3.9` and also `pypy3` as default.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nIt marks `python3.9` and `pypy3` as default test runner python executors.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nCI passed, and PySpark test are still running under python3.9 and pypy3.","created_at":"2022-01-03T03:09:13Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T01:23:01Z","closed_at":"2022-01-04T00:06:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f7d558231c60f9d3f1bcea3e7002c30c0bbfb1e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35087/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35087/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35087/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e9984fa8a3ceba93f963c3c5f463c2e0cdf7e13c","head":{"label":"Yikun:SPARK-33565","ref":"SPARK-33565","sha":"e9984fa8a3ceba93f963c3c5f463c2e0cdf7e13c","user":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335541670,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU1NDE2NzA=","name":"spark","full_name":"Yikun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yikun","id":1736354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MzYzNTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1736354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun","html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yikun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yikun/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nAdd support for removing shuffle files on released executors via the external shuffle service. The shuffle service already supports removing shuffle service cached RDD blocks, so I reused this mechanism to remove shuffle blocks as well, so as not to require updating the shuffle service itself.\r\n\r\nTo support this change functioning in a secure Yarn environment, I updated permissions on some of the block manager folders and files. Specifically:\r\n- Block manager sub directories have the group write posix permission added to them. This gives the shuffle service permission to delete files from within these folders.\r\n- Shuffle files have the world readable posix permission added to them. This is because when the sub directories are marked group writable, they lose the setgid bit that gets set in a secure Yarn environment. Without this, the permissions on the files would be `rw-r-----`, and since the group running Yarn (and therefore the shuffle service), is no longer the group owner of the file, it does not have access to read the file. The sub directories still do not have world execute permissions, so there's no security issue opening up these files.\r\n\r\nBoth of these changes are done after creating a file so that umasks don't affect the resulting permissions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nExternal shuffle services are very useful for long running jobs and dynamic allocation. However, currently if an executor is removed (either through dynamic deallocation or through some error), the shuffle files created by that executor will live until the application finishes. This results in local disks slowly filling up over time, eventually causing problems for long running applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit test. Not sure if there's a better way I could have tested for the files being deleted or any other tests I should add.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-02T14:16:00Z","updated_at":"2024-08-30T11:20:43Z","closed_at":"2022-03-25T18:01:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1f5a995b321f1b7d216fd97e2b7179812e12dda9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1984378631,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTg0Mzc4NjMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DSTREAM","name":"DSTREAM","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35085/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35085/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35085/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c39cdf385436a58309dfcd986cdad8f5179854e0","head":{"label":"Kimahriman:shuffle-service-remove-shuffle-blocks","ref":"shuffle-service-remove-shuffle-blocks","sha":"c39cdf385436a58309dfcd986cdad8f5179854e0","user":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":358979577,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg5Nzk1Nzc=","name":"spark","full_name":"Kimahriman/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Kimahriman","id":3536454,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM1MzY0NTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3536454?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman","html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Kimahriman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Kimahriman/spark","description":"Apache

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37798\r\n\r\nPandas currently supports a `how=\"cross\"` merge which provides a cartesian product of the left/right tables. This can be achieved by doing a `spark.sql.dataframe.join(..., on=None, how=\"inner\")`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am currently in the middle of adding conditional merging in the pandas API (see PR here: https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/42964). This is much easier to achieve in spark, since the functionality is already available, and we can trivially expose it in the pyspark pandas API. Due to the demand  of this functionality (countless SO/pandas issues either asking how to do this, or asking questions that would be solved by this), I think that this would be worth adding even before it makes it into the core pandas API.\r\n\r\nThese changes will be purely incremental on top of the existing API, and will be completely backwards compatible.\r\n\r\nStill need to add tests and docstring examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n\r\n**Example DFs:**\r\n```\r\n>>> df1 = pd.DataFrame([['Bill', 23], ['Mary', 33], ['Ted', 36]], columns=['name', 'age'])\r\n>>> df2 = pd.DataFrame([['President', 35], ['Senator', 30]], columns=['job', 'min_age'])\r\n>>> df1\r\n   name  age\r\n0  Bill   23\r\n1  Mary   33\r\n2   Ted   36\r\n\r\n>>> df2\r\n         job  min_age\r\n0  President       35\r\n1    Senator       30\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Cross  Merge Example:**\r\n```\r\n>>> df1.merge(df2, how=\"cross\")\r\n   name  age        job  min_age\r\n0  Bill   23  President       35\r\n1  Bill   23    Senator       30\r\n2  Mary   33  President       35\r\n3  Mary   33    Senator       30\r\n4   Ted   36  President       35\r\n5   Ted   36    Senator       30\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Conditional Merge Example:**\r\n```\r\n>>> df1.merge(df2, on=lambda left, right: left.age >= right.min_age)\r\n   name  age        job  min_age\r\n0  Mary   33    Senator       30\r\n1   Ted   36  President       35\r\n2   Ted   36    Senator

In this PR, I add the executable permission for all file after unzipping. It may cost some time to unzip that, but the time cost is controllable.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR.

So we should add executable permission to those script.\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1.

I compiled Python3.6.9 (which contains no other third party dependencies) and Python3.6.9 (which contains many third party dependencies) to include 8398 and 63570 files respectively and compressed them into a ZIP file, The zip file upload is then specified in spark-Submit, and the execution permission process is logged to record the time spent. The conclusion is that python3.9.zip took 50 to 65 milliseconds to find permissions, and the other one took 600 to 800 milliseconds.Then upload and test python3.6.9.zip and python3.6.9.tgz 100 times and find that the average unzip time of ZIP file is 15637.45 milliseconds, while the unzip time of TGZ file is 15758.78 milliseconds。That is to say, counting the time of adding execution permission, Zip also decompresses faster than TGZ.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPlease see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-37788\r\n\r\nThere are a few remaining functions that should but don't yet support ColumnOrName; this PR updates some annotations of functions that do support it, and converts input column string names to columns if not being done already.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAPI consistency in PySpark\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes; namely two array functions:\r\n\r\n- array_repeat; can now support `df.select(array_repeat(\"data\", \"repeat_n\").alias('r'))`\r\n- slice: can now support `df.select(slice(\"data\", \"index\", \"length\").alias('r'))`\r\n\r\nAffecting developers: there are also annotation changes to the following functions:\r\n\r\n- overlay\r\n- least\r\n\r\nPreviously, annotations in these functions related only to Column (but the function could support either column names or columns). The annotations for parameters of these two functions have been updated to ColumnOrName.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nModification to three existing unit tests, and an additional test for 'least'","created_at":"2021-12-30T20:39:53Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T19:13:01Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T19:12:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2339b23d50a8369b0244fb439eca6020007845aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35071/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35071/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35071/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/78e758d43f7319e1a48e794b3c21c72d3075ad23","head":{"label":"Daniel-Davies:Daniel-Davies/update-function-input-params","ref":"Daniel-Davies/update-function-input-params","sha":"78e758d43f7319e1a48e794b3c21c72d3075ad23","user":{"login":"Daniel-Davies","id":33356828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzU2ODI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33356828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniel-Davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":443144213,"node_id":"R_kgDOGmnYFQ","name":"spark","full_name":"Daniel-Davies/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Daniel-Davies","id":33356828,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzU2ODI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33356828?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies","html_url":"https://github.com/Daniel-Davies","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Daniel-Davies/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Daniel-Davies/spark","description":"Apache

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThere are a lot of aggregate functions in SQL and it's a lot of work to add them one by one in the DS v2 API. This PR proposes to add a new `GeneralAggregateFunc` class to represent all the general SQL aggregate functions. Since it's general, Spark doesn't know its aggregation buffer and can only push down the aggregation to the source completely.\r\n\r\nAs an example, this PR also translates `AVG` to `GeneralAggregateFunc` and pushes it to JDBC V2.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo add aggregate functions in DS v2 easier.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nJDBC v2

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to let `WorkerWatcher` run `System.exit` in a separate thread instead of some thread of `RpcEnv`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`System.exit` will trigger the shutdown hook to run `executor.stop`, which will result in the same deadlock issue with SPARK-14180. But note that since Spark upgrades to Hadoop 3  recently, each hook now will have a [timeout threshold](https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/d4794dd3b2ba365a9d95ad6aafcf43a1ea40f777/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/util/ShutdownHookManager.java#L205-L209) which forcibly interrupt the hook execution once reaches timeout. So, the deadlock issue doesn't really exist in the master branch. However, it's still critical for previous releases and is a wrong behavior that should be fixed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTested manually.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-30T08:37:46Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T03:04:35Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T02:48:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d4166d5e77d85313d3dc09e06b910a408e7a60c2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35069/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35069/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35069/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9bcfcd696bfdfcbe8b0d875a18ae67a09748f37e","head":{"label":"Ngone51:fix-workerwatcher-exit","ref":"fix-workerwatcher-exit","sha":"9bcfcd696bfdfcbe8b0d875a18ae67a09748f37e","user":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114185286,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQxODUyODY=","name":"spark","full_name":"Ngone51/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Ngone51","id":16397174,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2Mzk3MTc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16397174?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51","html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ngone51/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Ngone51/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a correctness issue in the CodeGenerator.addBufferedState() helper method (which is used by the SortMergeJoinExec operator). \r\n\r\nThe addBufferedState() method generates code for buffering values that come from a row in an operator's input iterator, performing any necessary copying so that the buffered values remain correct after the input iterator advances to the next row.\r\n\r\nThe current logic does not correctly handle UDTs: these fall through to the match statement's default branch, causing UDT values to be buffered without copying. This is problematic if the UDT's underlying SQL type is an array, map, struct, or string type (since those types require copying). Failing to copy values can lead to correctness issues or crashes.\r\n\r\nThis patch's fix is simple: when the dataType is a UDT, use its underlying sqlType for determining whether values need to be copied. I used an existing helper function to perform this type unwrapping.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix a correctness issue.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI manually tested this change by re-running a workload which failed with a segfault prior to this patch.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add `Utils.isInRunningSparkTask` to see if the codes are running on tasks e.g., on executors.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere is currently no single call to see if we're in a running Spark task (e.g., in executors). `TaskContext.get == null` is being used for that way. We should better explicitly factor out to `Utils`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting unittests should cover this

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis follow-ups for SPARK-37657 to separate the test based on pandas version, as the supported minimum pandas version is 1.0.5, but some tests require pandas 1.1.0 and above.\r\n\r\nFor pandas < 1.1.0, we should test by manually creating the expected result DataFrame.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nBecause pandas < 1.1.0 doesn't support the `datetime_is_numeric` for `(Series|DataFrame).describe()` as below:\r\n```python\r\n>>> pdf.describe(datetime_is_numeric=True)\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\nTypeError: describe() got an unexpected keyword argument 'datetime_is_numeric'\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut we support pandas 1.0.5 as minimum version.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, it's test only\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMakes `DataFrame.transform` take the parameters for the function.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently when a function which takes parameters besides DataFrame is passed to `DataFrame.transform`, `lambda` needs to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> from pyspark.sql.functions import col\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame([(1, 1.0), (2, 2.0)], [\"int\", \"float\"])\r\n>>> def add_n(input_df, n):\r\n...     return input_df.select([(col(col_name) + n).alias(col_name)\r\n...                             for col_name in input_df.columns])\r\n>>> df.transform(lambda input_df: add_n(input_df, 1)).transform(lambda input_df: add_n(input_df, n=10)).show()\r\n+---+-----+\r\n|int|float|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n| 12| 12.0|\r\n| 13| 13.0|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaking `DataFrame.transform` take the parameters would be more convenient.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, `DataFrame.transform` can take the parameters for the function.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n>>> df.transform(add_n, 1).transform(add_n, n=10).show()\r\n+---+-----+\r\n|int|float|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n| 12| 12.0|\r\n| 13| 13.0|\r\n+---+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded the corresponding doctests.","created_at":"2021-12-29T22:38:08Z","updated_at":"2021-12-30T01:39:39Z","closed_at":"2021-12-30T01:39:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1ea7c5f2357f7494566319f59f6c13a54a51367c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35062/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35062/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35062/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ea625ddefbe42139d68c5b7791cba2e499a4578","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-37782/transform","ref":"issues/SPARK-37782/transform","sha":"9ea625ddefbe42139d68c5b7791cba2e499a4578","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn PR #34642, we added a `supportsRowBased` in `SparkPlan` in order to avoid\r\nredundant `ColumnarToRow` transition in `InMemoryTableScan `. But, this optimization\r\nalso applies to Union if its children both support row-based output.\r\nSo, this PR adds the `supportsRowBased` implementation for `UnionExec`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nfollowup PR\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nMany database support the function `to_number` to convert a string to number. \r\nThe implement of `to_number` has many different between `Postgresql` ,`Oracle` and `Phoenix`.\r\nSo, this PR follows the implement of `to_number` in `Oracle` that give a strict parameter verification.\r\nSo, this PR follows the implement of `to_number` in `Phoenix` that uses BigDecimal.\r\n\r\nThis PR support the patterns for numeric formatting as follows:\r\n\r\nPattern | Description\r\n-- | --\r\n9 | digit position\r\n0 | digit position\r\n. (period)

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrent QueryExecutionListener only support add constructor parameter of SparkConf, but if we  start a SparkContext first, many SQL conf won't be applied to SparkContext's SparkConf.\r\nAlso it's a SQL component,  related configuration we defined it as SQLConf. But it's hard to use SQLConf in this plugin listener.\r\n\r\nThis patch, we use pass SQLConf to `ExecutionListenerManager` and use `SQLConf.withExistingConf` to wrap the passed `SQLConf`. Then we can use `SQLConf.get` to get the same SQLConf of `SessionState` when initializing `QueryExecutionListener`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nPass corresponding SessionState's SQLConf to QueryExecutionListener. Then user can use SQLConf.get to use the  SQLConf.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUser can use QueryExecutionListener with corresponding `SessionState`'s `SQLConf`.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe SQL syntax of `SHOW FUNCTIONS` is very weird today. If you want to specify the database to list functions, you need to write `SHOW FUNCTIONS LIKE db.f1`. This is inconsistent with `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW VIEWS`.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to follow `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW VIEWS`, and support `SHOW FUNCTIONS FROM/IN db LIKE pattern`. To keep backward compatibility, the legacy syntax is still supported, but it can't be used together with the new `FROM/IN db` clause.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBe consistent with `SHOW TABLES` and `SHOW VIEWS`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYea, as it extends the `SHOW FUNCTIONS` SQL syntax.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nupdated tests

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nDisable certain doctests of `ps.to_timedelta` for pandas<=1.0.5\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`ps.to_timedelta` is backed by `pd.to_timedelta` (in pandas).\r\n\r\nDoctest results of `ps.to_timedelta`  are consistent with the latest pandas.\r\n\r\nHowever, some of them (related to seconds) will fail with pandas <=1.0.5 since older pandas lose precision.\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# In pyspark.pandas.namespace.to_timedelta\r\n\r\nFailed example:\r\n    ps.to_timedelta('15.5us')\r\nExpected:\r\n    Timedelta('0 days 00:00:00.000015500')\r\n<= pd 1.0.5:\r\n    Timedelta('0 days 00:00:00.000015')\r\n\r\n\r\nFailed example:\r\n    ps.to_timedelta(['1 days 06:05:01.00003', '15.5us', 'nan'])  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE\r\nExpected:\r\n    TimedeltaIndex(['1 days 06:05:01.000030', '0 days 00:00:00.000015500', NaT],\r\n                   dtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n<= pd 1.0.5:\r\n    TimedeltaIndex(['1 days 06:05:01.000030', '0 days 00:00:00.000015', NaT], dtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n\r\nFailed example:\r\n    ps.to_timedelta(np.arange(5), unit='s')  # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE\r\nExpected:\r\n    TimedeltaIndex(['0 days 00:00:00', '0 days 00:00:01', '0 days 00:00:02',\r\n                    '0 days 00:00:03', '0 days 00:00:04'],\r\n                   dtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n<= pd 1.0.5:\r\n    TimedeltaIndex(['00:00:00', '00:00:01', '00:00:02', '00:00:03', '00:00:04'], dtype='timedelta64[ns]', freq=None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo we disable them.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual tests.","created_at":"2021-12-29T04:42:52Z","updated_at":"2021-12-29T05:13:13Z","closed_at":"2021-12-29T05:13:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5cb25128b5f1fb115c7499d599a75b4767169e72","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35050/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/35050/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/35050/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/222afc66a4e19960f05688563647da8bc1e13b0f","head":{"label":"xinrong-meng:SPARK-37773","ref":"SPARK-37773","sha":"222afc66a4e19960f05688563647da8bc1e13b0f","user":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":335786381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzU3ODYzODE=","name":"spark","full_name":"xinrong-meng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng/spark","description":"Apache
