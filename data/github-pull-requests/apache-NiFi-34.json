Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10373](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10373) Sets a common managed version of AWS SDK version 1 and 2 in the root Maven configuration. This approach eliminates different versions in sub-projects and modules. Some components still rely on AWS SDK 1, so both SDK versions must be maintained. Additional changes include suppressing a false positive dependency vulnerability for `aws-sdk-swf-libraries`.\r\n\r\n- AWS SDK 1 set to version 1.12.299\r\n- AWS SDK 2 set to version 2.17.270\r\n\r\n#

This means that similarly to the C++ agent it can be controlled with the property \"c2.full.heartbeat\" whether the manifest (which is the biggest part of the heartbeat) is included or not. If the C2 server requires the manifest from the agent it can issue a DESCRIBE / MANIFEST operation which will be fulfilled in the acknowledgement. To notify the server about potential manifest changes the manifest hash is updated so the server can determine whether there was a change or not and whether it needs to request a DESCRIBE / MANIFEST.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [x] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10449](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10449) This PR fixes an issue where ScriptedLookupService controller services were not reloading at certain times, such as after being disabled with no changes made. This causes things like Parameter value changes not to be picked up. The approach to the fix was basically to do the same as is done with InvokeScriptedProcessor and other scripted controller services.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-9500](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-9500) Adds a `nifi.cmd` script for running application actions on Windows. \r\n\r\nThe implementation contains a basic set of capabilities similar to `nifi.sh`, including support for the `set-single-user-credentials`, `set-sensitive-properties-key`, and `set-sensitive-properties-algorithm` commands.\r\n\r\nThe script leverages a new `nifi-env.cmd` to avoid depending on the current `nifi-env.bat` script. The `cmd` approach and current directory resolution avoids directory name truncation artifacts present in the `bat` versions.\r\n\r\nThis implementation should provide a way forward for support on Windows, with the opportunity to deprecate the `bat` files in a future major release version.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

I attempted to unit test this, but due to how the NiFi mock framework works, every flowfile is read into memory in full even if that FlowFile is backed by a `NullInputStream`. I couldn't find a nice alternative to verify with a unit test.\r\n\r\nSo to verify i deployed this processor and tested with the following setup, with the `MergeContent` processor configured to tar archive the bins:\r\n\r\n`GenerateFlowFile` --- 9GB file ---> `MergeContent` --> `LogAttribute`\r\n\r\nPrior to this fix, the MergeContent processor would complain with the following error:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: entry size '<FlowFileSize>' is too big (> 8589934591)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA similar fix was made in a different project: https://github.com/DataConservancy/dcs-packaging-tool/pull/36/files\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

This test implemented the [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) tool to find the codes where non-determination happened.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

issue where the jsoup cleaner may incorrectly sanitize crafted XSS attempts if\nSafeList.preserveRelativeLinks is enabled.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369\">https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the Cleaner will preserve the source position of cleaned elements, if source tracking is enabled in the\noriginal parse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the error messages output from Validate are more descriptive. Exceptions are now ValidationExceptions\n(extending IllegalArgumentException). Stack traces do not include the Validate class, to make it simpler to see\nwhere the exception originated. Common validation errors including malformed URLs and empty selector results have\nmore explicit error messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the DataUtil would incorrectly read from InputStreams that emitted reads less than the requested size. This\nlead to incorrect results when parsing from chunked server responses, for e.g.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1807\">jhy/jsoup#1807</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build Improvement: added implementation version and related fields to the jar manifest.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1809\">jhy/jsoup#1809</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [2022-Jul-04]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the ability to track the position (line, column, index) in the original input source from where\na given node was parsed. Accessible via Node.sourceRange() and Element.endSourceRange().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1790\">jhy/jsoup#1790</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.firstElementChild(), Element.lastElementChild(), Node.firstChild(), Node.lastChild(),\nas convenient accessors to those child nodes and elements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.expectFirst(cssQuery), which is just like Element.selectFirst(), but instead of returning\na null if there is no match, will throw an IllegalArgumentException.

href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369\">https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the Cleaner will preserve the source position of cleaned elements, if source tracking is enabled in the\noriginal parse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the error messages output from Validate are more descriptive. Exceptions are now ValidationExceptions\n(extending IllegalArgumentException). Stack traces do not include the Validate class, to make it simpler to see\nwhere the exception originated. Common validation errors including malformed URLs and empty selector results have\nmore explicit error messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the DataUtil would incorrectly read from InputStreams that emitted reads less than the requested size. This\nlead to incorrect results when parsing from chunked server responses, for e.g.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1807\">jhy/jsoup#1807</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build Improvement: added implementation version and related fields to the jar manifest.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1809\">jhy/jsoup#1809</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [2022-Jul-04]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the ability to track the position (line, column, index) in the original input source from where\na given node was parsed. Accessible via Node.sourceRange() and Element.endSourceRange().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1790\">jhy/jsoup#1790</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.firstElementChild(), Element.lastElementChild(), Node.firstChild(), Node.lastChild(),\nas convenient accessors to those child nodes and elements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.expectFirst(cssQuery), which is just like Element.selectFirst(), but instead of returning\na null if there is no match, will throw an IllegalArgumentException. This is useful if you want to simply abort\nprocessing if an expected match is not found.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing HTML, doctypes are emitted on a newline if there is a preceding comment.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1664\">jhy/jsoup#1664</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, trim the leading and trailing spaces of textnodes in block tags when possible,\nso that they are indented correctly.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1798\">jhy/jsoup#1798</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#selectXpath(), disable namespace awareness. This makes it possible to always select elements\nby their simple local name, regardless of whether an xmlns attribute was set.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1801\">jhy/jsoup#1801</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when using the readToByteBuffer method, such as in Connection.Response.body(), if the document has not\nalready been parsed and must be read fully, and there is any maximum buffer size being applied, only the default\ninternal buffer size is read.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1774\">jhy/jsoup#1774</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

issue where the jsoup cleaner may incorrectly sanitize crafted XSS attempts if\nSafeList.preserveRelativeLinks is enabled.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369\">https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/security/advisories/GHSA-gp7f-rwcx-9369</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the Cleaner will preserve the source position of cleaned elements, if source tracking is enabled in the\noriginal parse.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the error messages output from Validate are more descriptive. Exceptions are now ValidationExceptions\n(extending IllegalArgumentException). Stack traces do not include the Validate class, to make it simpler to see\nwhere the exception originated. Common validation errors including malformed URLs and empty selector results have\nmore explicit error messages.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: the DataUtil would incorrectly read from InputStreams that emitted reads less than the requested size. This\nlead to incorrect results when parsing from chunked server responses, for e.g.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1807\">jhy/jsoup#1807</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Build Improvement: added implementation version and related fields to the jar manifest.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1809\">jhy/jsoup#1809</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.2 [2022-Jul-04]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the ability to track the position (line, column, index) in the original input source from where\na given node was parsed. Accessible via Node.sourceRange() and Element.endSourceRange().\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1790\">jhy/jsoup#1790</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.firstElementChild(), Element.lastElementChild(), Node.firstChild(), Node.lastChild(),\nas convenient accessors to those child nodes and elements.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added Element.expectFirst(cssQuery), which is just like Element.selectFirst(), but instead of returning\na null if there is no match, will throw an IllegalArgumentException. This is useful if you want to simply abort\nprocessing if an expected match is not found.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing HTML, doctypes are emitted on a newline if there is a preceding comment.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1664\">jhy/jsoup#1664</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, trim the leading and trailing spaces of textnodes in block tags when possible,\nso that they are indented correctly.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1798\">jhy/jsoup#1798</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#selectXpath(), disable namespace awareness. This makes it possible to always select elements\nby their simple local name, regardless of whether an xmlns attribute was set.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1801\">jhy/jsoup#1801</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: when using the readToByteBuffer method, such as in Connection.Response.body(), if the document has not\nalready been parsed and must be read fully, and there is any maximum buffer size being applied, only the default\ninternal buffer size is read.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1774\">jhy/jsoup#1774</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10408](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10408) Improves error handling in `LdapUserGroupProvider` when custom identity mapping properties result in an empty user identity. The new `buildUser()` methods check the content of the mapped user identity prior to building the `User` object, and throw an `IllegalArgumentException` containing the directory reference details when the identity is blank.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include using the simplified Apache Commons `BasicThreadFactory` for naming the background synchronization process, updating usage of deprecated `FormatUtils` methods, and replacing `String.format()` with placeholders in several debug log statements.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

The reason for that is due to the non-deterministic behavior of `java.util.HashMap`, which makes no guarantees as to the order of the map.\r\n\r\nThe fix is mainly to preserve the ordering when interact with the map object.\r\n \r\n# Brief changelog\r\nChange the usage of `java.util.HashMap` to `java.util.LinkedHashMap`. \r\n\r\nLinkedHashMap in Java 8 is implemented using double-linked list, the list will define the iteration ordering, therefore, when interact with the map object, the order will be the same for different iteration of the test. \r\n\r\nDue to this change, I also update the expected value used in the test.\r\n\r\n# Verification\r\n`mvn -pl nifi-commons/nifi-site-to-site-client edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:1.1.2:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.nifi.remote.client.http.TestHttpClient#testSendSuccessWithProxy -DnondexRuns=10`\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n- [x] Build completed using `mvn install -pl

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10395](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10395) Adds Apache Xalan to the list of banned dependencies. The last version 2.7.2 was released in April 2014 and CVE-2022-34169 highlights the fact that the project is dormant, with no future releases expected. The dependency is not currently used and should not be necessary as standard Java distributions include a repackaged version.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10313](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10313) Corrects user interface error handling to remove the internal `Access-Token-Expiration` tracker from browser session storage when receiving specific HTTP authentication errors.\r\n\r\nUpdates to the standard error handler include checking for the presence of the `WWW-Authenticate` HTTP response header and determining whether it starts with `Bearer`. The `StandardAuthenticationEntryPoint` introduced in [NIFI-10259](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10259) sets this header when encountering an error while parsing and verifying a JSON Web Token. The standard error handler removes the `Access-Token-Expiration` tracker from browser session storage, instructing the user interface to initiate a new authentication process when the user navigates to the application home screen.\r\n\r\nThis update improves behavior for Kerberos SPNEGO authentication scenarios. Without these changes, the REST API instructs the browser to remove the session cookie, but the user interface does not remove the `Access-Token-Expiration` tracker. This results in the user interface displaying the log out link, which does not work, and the home link, which redirects to the login screen, requiring an additional click to the home screen to start a new session. With these changes, an expired session presents the standard error message and the home link, which starts a new authentication session as expected.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10321](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10321) Adjusts the response body message to send a simplified Session Expired notification when the REST API receives a request with an expired JSON Web Token. This is a common scenario when authenticating with username and password credentials or integrating with an external identity provider.\r\n\r\nRecent changes to provide more detailed error messages for invalid JSON Web Tokens included sending the contents of the `WWW-Authenticate` header as the response body message. This message includes an error code, error description, and reference URI. When a JSON Web Token expires, the REST API returns the following message in the `WWW-Authenticate` header:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror=\"invalid_token\", error_description=\"An error occurred while attempting to decode the Jwt: Expired JWT\", error_uri=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough this is accurate, it is not the most intuitive message for the common occurrence of an expired session. Although the Nimbus JOSE JWT library does not throw a specialized exception for an expired JWT, it does include a [standard message](https://bitbucket.org/connect2id/nimbus-jose-jwt/src/54337ac3f00ad3fa55680a68414449fcdd266c36/src/main/java/com/nimbusds/jwt/proc/DefaultJWTClaimsVerifier.java?at=master#lines-342), which Spring Security appends to the error description.\r\n\r\nThis implementation checks for the presence of the standard `Expired JWT` message returns a simplified Session Expired message in the response body while retaining the error details in the `WWW-Authenticate` response header.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-10381](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-10381) Refactors the following Azure Event Hubs components from legacy version 3 to current version 5 of the Azure SDK for Java:\r\n\r\n- ConsumeAzureEventHub\r\n- GetAzureEventHub\r\n- PutAzureEventHub\r\n\r\nRefactoring also includes moving the `AzureEventHubRecordSink` from the separate `nifi-azure-record-sink-nar` to the shared `nifi-azure-nar`.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the `Consumer Host` property in `ConsumeAzureEventHub`, migrating to the current version of the Azure SDK maintains support for current component properties. The current Azure Event Hubs SDK handles unique Event Processor identification using an internal UUID.\r\n\r\nUpgrading to the current Azure SDK also provided the opportunity to streamline dependency management using the [Azure SDK Bill of Materials](https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.azure/azure-sdk-bom/1.2.4/pom). The `nifi-azure-processors` module retains legacy dependencies for Azure Storage and Azure Key Vault, but all current Azure SDK libraries can be aligned and managed using the Bill of Materials dependency.\r\n\r\nInternal changes include refactor `PutAzureEventHub` to use the standard synchronous client instead of creating a separate executor service. The current Azure SDK maintains an internal elastic executor for handling socket communication.\r\n\r\nAdditional improvements include standardizing unit tests and removing duplication in some test methods. The `jsr305` module is no longer a transitive dependency of current libraries, so changes include removing this unnecessary exclusion.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking
