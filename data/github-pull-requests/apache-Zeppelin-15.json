[lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) from 3.9.3 to 4.17.15.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n\n*Sourced from [lodash's releases](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/releases).*\n\n> ## 4.0.0\n> # [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400)\n> \n> 2015 was big year! [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) became the [most depended on](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md) npm package, passed [1 billion](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=jdalton) downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!\n> \n> The year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on [merging Lodash & Underscore](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14). Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 **would not be possible** without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with [several members](https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people) contributing to both libraries.\n> \n> For 2016 & [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!\n> \n> ## Modern only\n> \n> With v4 we’re breaking free from [old projects](https://github.com/lodash-archive), old environments, & dropping [old IE < 9 support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)!\n> \n> ## 4 kB Core\n> \n> Lodash’s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) [core build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist) that’s compatible with [Backbone v1.2.4](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839) for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.\n> \n> ## More ES6\n> \n> We’ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like [_.isSymbol](https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol), added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable `_(…)`.\n> \n> In addition, we’ve published an [es-build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/) & pulled [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.\n> \n> ## More Modular\n> \n> Pop quiz! 📣\n> \n> What category path does the `bindAll` method belong to? Is it \n> \n> A) `require('lodash/function/bindAll')`\n> B) `require('lodash/utility/bindAll')`\n> C) `require('lodash/util/bindAll')`\n> \n> Don’t know? Well, with v4 it doesn’t matter because now module paths are as simple as\n> \n> ``` js\n> var bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');\n> ```\n> \n> We’ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like [Async](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/caolan/async/pull/996) & [Redux](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rackt/redux/pull/611)!\n> \n> ## 1st Class FP\n> \n> With v3 we introduced [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp). We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to [pull it into core](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).\n> \n> Now you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as\n> \n> ``` js\n> var _ = require('lodash/fp');\n> var object = { 'a': 1 };\n></tr></table> ...

[lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) from 3.9.3 to 4.17.15.\n<details>\n<summary>Release notes</summary>\n\n*Sourced from [lodash's releases](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/releases).*\n\n> ## 4.0.0\n> # [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400)\n> \n> 2015 was big year! [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) became the [most depended on](https://gist.github.com/anvaka/8e8fa57c7ee1350e3491#file-01-most-dependent-upon-md) npm package, passed [1 billion](http://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=&author=jdalton) downloads, & its v3 release saw massive adoption!\n> \n> The year was also one of collaboration, as discussions began on [merging Lodash & Underscore](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/underdash/underdash/issues/14). Much of Lodash v4 is proofing out the ideas from those discussions. Lodash v4 **would not be possible** without the collaboration & contributions of the Underscore core team. In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with [several members](https://github.com/orgs/lodash/people) contributing to both libraries.\n> \n> For 2016 & [lodash v4.0.0](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/Changelog#v400) we wanted to cut loose, push forward, & take things up a notch!\n> \n> ## Modern only\n> \n> With v4 we’re breaking free from [old projects](https://github.com/lodash-archive), old environments, & dropping [old IE < 9 support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/End-of-IE-support)!\n> \n> ## 4 kB Core\n> \n> Lodash’s kitchen-sink size will continue to grow as new methods & functionality are added. However, we now offer a 4 kB (gzipped) [core build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0/dist) that’s compatible with [Backbone v1.2.4](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/3839) for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink.\n> \n> ## More ES6\n> \n> We’ve continued to embrace ES6 with methods like [_.isSymbol](https://lodash.com/docs#isSymbol), added support for cloning & comparing array buffers, maps, sets, & symbols, converting iterators to arrays, & iterable `_(…)`.\n> \n> In addition, we’ve published an [es-build](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/tree/4.0.0-es/) & pulled [babel-plugin-lodash](https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash) into core to make tree-shaking a breeze.\n> \n> ## More Modular\n> \n> Pop quiz! 📣\n> \n> What category path does the `bindAll` method belong to? Is it \n> \n> A) `require('lodash/function/bindAll')`\n> B) `require('lodash/utility/bindAll')`\n> C) `require('lodash/util/bindAll')`\n> \n> Don’t know? Well, with v4 it doesn’t matter because now module paths are as simple as\n> \n> ``` js\n> var bindAll = require('lodash/bindAll');\n> ```\n> \n> We’ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles. This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like [Async](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/caolan/async/pull/996) & [Redux](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/rackt/redux/pull/611)!\n> \n> ## 1st Class FP\n> \n> With v3 we introduced [lodash-fp](https://github.com/lodash-archive/lodash-fp). We learned a lot & with v4 we decided to [pull it into core](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide).\n> \n> Now you can get immutable, auto-curried, iteratee-first, data-last methods as simply as\n> \n> ``` js\n> var _ = require('lodash/fp');\n> var object = { 'a': 1 };\n></tr></table> ...

issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4412\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n- Create a notebook with spark interpreter \r\n- Make a call to

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR provides the ability to copy/paste the entire result table from a paragraph.\r\n\r\nCurrently, there's an option to download the result table into a csv or tsv file, but it creates a new file for each result table per paragraph. In order to copy multiple result tables from same and different notebooks we've to download each file, copy the dataset, and paste it into one external app. \r\n\r\nWith this new approach there's no need to download multiple files. Simply click on either CopyAll (copies data in TSV format) or pick the options from drop down menu to download or copy table as TSV/CSV. This makes it easier to copy dataset of multiple tables into one external app without creating and opening multiple files.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4407\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n - Create a dataframe \r\n- use z.show(df)\r\n- Click on CopyAll\r\n- Paste into external app\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n#\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51380329/67910009-7b7f5f80-fb3e-11e9-9b51-580d66df9a23.png)\r\n## Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nWith this pull requests, we build zeppelin images, which are able to start as a random user. Random users are a security concept in some k8s products like Openshift ([reason](https://cookbook.openshift.org/users-and-role-based-access-control/why-do-my-applications-run-as-a-random-user-id.html))\r\nIn start script we write a user entry in `/etc/passwd`, because a user entry is needed for Hadoop. Logins for zeppelin are not allowed (`/bin/false`).\r\nThe zeppelin process doesn't need write access to binaries in zeppelin home folder. Only a few folder are writable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nImprovement\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-4397](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4397)\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* First time?

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 10.9.0 or later or use [creationix/nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).\r\n- NPM package manager (which is installed with Node.js by default).\r\n- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli) version 8.3.0 or later.\r\n\r\n#### Install\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cd zeppelin-frontend\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\nInstall dependencies in the project directory.\r\n\r\n### Start Zeppelin server\r\n\r\n[Run Zeppelin server](https://zeppelin.apache.org/contribution/contributions.html#run-zeppelin-server-in-development-mode) on `http://localhost:8080`.\r\n\r\nIf you are using a custom port instead of the default(http://localhost:8080) or other network address, you can create `.env` file in the project directory and set `SERVER_PROXY`.\r\n\r\n*.env*\r\n\r\n```\r\nSERVER_PROXY=http://localhost:8080\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Development server\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm start\r\n```\r\nNavigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\nRun `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n**Login**\r\n\r\n![login](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22736418/67387927-62206580-f5ca-11e9-8268-e7036f32ea1c.png)\r\n\r\n**Home**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22736418/67388288-f4286e00-f5ca-11e9-9265-c9290830a5cd.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22736418/67388304-f8ed2200-f5ca-11e9-9368-09b00edd1d67.png)\r\n\r\n**Interpreter**\r\n\r\n![zp-interpreter](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22736418/67388335-086c6b00-f5cb-11e9-9d03-add1054c3aeb.gif)\r\n\r\n**Job Manager**\r\n\r\n![zp-jm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22736418/67388392-21751c00-f5cb-11e9-8170-f311fd0dced4.gif)\r\n\r\n**Dynamic Form**\r\n\r\n![zp-df](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22736418/67388447-3ce02700-f5cb-11e9-90dd-cee932fa685c.gif)\r\n\r\n**Frontend API(latest Angular)**\r\n\r\n![zp-ng](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22736418/67388538-70bb4c80-f5cb-11e9-921d-6c34a4a99711.gif)\r\n\r\n** Visualization**\r\n\r\n![zp-vis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22736418/67388602-8c265780-f5cb-11e9-9de9-e198878bee09.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nGoal is to make Scio & Beam interpreters buildable with Scala 2.11 profile.\r\n\r\nNow both Scio & Beam interpreters explicitly use Scala 2.10, so it's possible\r\nto compile both if Scala 2.11 profile is enabled.\r\n\r\nAlso was need to add missing dependency for Beam interpreter, otherwise it didn't work.\r\n\r\nPlus small rework of the properties, so the Scala 2.10 version could be explicitly used in\r\nthe interpreters. (Also, tried Scala 2.10.7, and it didn't work, so we must stay on 2.10.5).\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix \r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n*

What is this PR for?\r\nBecause docker first used the `while :; do sleep 1; done` script to start the container.\r\n\r\nExecute `bin/interpreter.sh` to execute the interpreter startup script in the container.\r\n\r\nWhen zeppelin closes or restarts the interpreter in docker, the interpreter process in the container can exit normally, but the container's startup shell does not exit, causing the container to continue running.\r\n\r\nSo we need to determine if the interpreter process exits in the container's startup script.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-4263\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n[CI Pass](https://travis-ci.org/liuxunorg/zeppelin/builds/585091106)\r\n\r\n###

No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThe hotfix that was made several weeks ago changed behavior of LocalStorageConfig.atomicWriteToFile, that started to atomically move files to destination. But this works without errors only when temporary directory and destination are on the same disk. When they are on different disks, atomic move isn't possible, so the exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by performing non-atomic move to temp file on destination file system, and then atomically rename it to destination file.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n\r\nBug Fix\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n\r\nZEPPELIN-4305\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\nNo\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\nNo\r\n* Does this needs

What is this PR for?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a re-submission of the original ZEPPELIN-1070 PR. The original PR seems to be abandoned and I am currently creating custom builds of Zeppelin with the ZEPPELIN-1070 PR included so I am interested in getting the PR merged. I am submitting two PRs one for 0.8X branch and one that includes fixes for merge conflicts to the master branch.\r\n\r\nOriginal PR Description:\r\n\r\n> This PR enables a generic syntax for inserting credentials. A username can be inserted by $[user.entry] where \"entry\" is the name of the credential. A password can be inserted by $[password.entry].\r\n> To avoid output of the password all occurences of the password-String in the Interpreter-output will be replaced by \"###\". This should not be a really secure feature (since the runner of the notebook knows the password anyway), but it should avoid accidential exposure of the used passwords by any sort of interpreter \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Documentation\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1070\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nUnit tests included in PR\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? **No**\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? **Only in very unlikely circumstances. IE: code that matched {user.VALID_CREDENTIAL_ENTITY} or {password.VALID_CREDENTIAL_ENTITY}.**\r\n* Does this needs documentation? **Yes**\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-07-29T13:17:05Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T14:41:17Z","closed_at":"2019-10-30T01:38:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc51ac65d8d34ac059903207a3632c8569cb542b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/3416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/3416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/be300d33a3da8a59586d2aedbc4c5205649b825f","head":{"label":"jpmcmu:ZEPPELIN-1070","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1070","sha":"be300d33a3da8a59586d2aedbc4c5205649b825f","user":{"login":"jpmcmu","id":7181610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7181610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu","html_url":"https://github.com/jpmcmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":199452408,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTk0NTI0MDg=","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"jpmcmu/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jpmcmu","id":7181610,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxODE2MTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7181610?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu","html_url":"https://github.com/jpmcmu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpmcmu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jpmcmu/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

A username can be inserted by $[user.entry] where \"entry\" is the name of the credential. A password can be inserted by $[password.entry].\r\n> To avoid output of the password all occurences of the password-String in the Interpreter-output will be replaced by \"###\". This should not be a really secure feature (since the runner of the notebook knows the password anyway), but it should avoid accidential exposure of the used passwords by any sort of interpreter \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Documentation\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1070\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nUnit tests are included in PR\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update? **No**\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions? **Only in very unlikely circumstances.
