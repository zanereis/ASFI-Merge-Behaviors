vulnerability fix prevents using local repos in Jenkins in the most recent versions.\r\n\r\n> Command line git and JGit can fetch a repository using a local URL (like file:/my/repo.git) or a path (like /my/repo.git). [SECURITY-2478](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-05-17/#SECURITY-2478) notes that fetching from a local URL or a path creates a security vulnerability on the Jenkins controller. Current releases of the git plugin disallow fetch from a local URL and from a path. If a local URL or a path is required and administrators accept the risk of disabling this security safeguard, the Java property `hudson.plugins.git.GitSCM.ALLOW_LOCAL_CHECKOUT=true` can be set from the command line that starts the Jenkins controller.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

added a [random string](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/4869/files#diff-b47580f7fcc36b9a014a20be2dd4dc3207ce1e17120358bbf32330d64097f32fR170) to the end of query job names to make this step resilient to retries. This query step creates a temp destination + table to output the query to. The next step would be to export data from this temp table to files, then **delete the temp table+destination** and read from those files. The problem was if a retry happened right after/during temp table+destination deletion, we would need to retry the query job. However, BQ would see the old successful query job name and return as so without actually querying and creating the temp table. The next step, export to files, would always fail because the table we are trying to export from does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe solution introduced by #4869 was written over in a code refactor in #12082 and the random string was lost [here](https://github.com/apache/beam/commit/9af54351ddc31c607d1634382704c8a52aaa78f3#diff-471ca9a2a4c3366613d75c1d98736b7d88c0873d2abc126e01577c937c3759dbL145). This re-introduced the problem of having a deterministic query job name that was vulnerable to retries.\r\n\r\nThis PR just adds back that string to the end of the query job name.\r\n\r\nFixes

We can eliminate (36.94-19.19)+(92.42-37.9) millis from which leads to a 0.2% performance improvement for the pipeline but leads to substantially larger gains for trivial lambdas.

#21654\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the contract for registered BatchConverter constructors (internal API). Previously a mismatched constructor should return `None` - now it should raise a `TypeError` with an explanation of why it is mismatched. When we fail to match any BatchConverters, an exception is raised that includes a summary of all the mismatch reasons.\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master

BigtableIO to use the java veneer client under the hood. In the future, we'll move to java-bigtable-hbase 2.x versions and deprecate bigtable-client-core.\r\n\r\nThe new code has the following structure:\r\n- `BigatableConfig` - defines the client connection level settings\r\n- `BigtableReadOptions` and `BigtableWriteOptions` - defines the tables to read / write and their timeout settings\r\n- deprecate `BigtableOptions`\r\n\r\n`BigtableIO.Read` or `BigtableIO.Write` with the same configuration will share the same `BigtableService`. The service is cached in `BigtableServiceFactory`. Whenever we instantiating a new `BigtableService`, translate all the configurations including `BigtableOptions` to bigtable veneer settings.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR changes the PipelineTranslator to support caching datasets if they are used multiple times.\r\nThis is an outstanding feature compared to the RDD runner and critical to run batch pipelines on large scale as it prevents the potentially costly re-evaluation of datasets (closes #24008). Additionally this PR is a preparation to fix / simplify handling of side inputs (see #24035).\r\n\r\nIn our benchmarks, considering the insignificant scale of both nexmark and tpc-ds (1GB) tests, the impact of this is expected to be neutral or even negative. \r\n\r\nPipeline translation is changed as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Detect if `streaming` mode is required.\r\n      - As is, just removed unnecessary clutter.\r\n2) Identify datasets that are repeatedly used as input and should be cached.\r\n      - New translation step, similar to the one done in the RDD runner.\r\n      - Rather than just gathering translation state as `Map<PCollection, Dataset>`, this has turned into `Map<PCollection, TranslationResult>` to track the `Dataset` but also additional metadata such as dependencies (and broadcast variables once #24035 is addressed)\r\n3) And finally, translate each primitive or composite `PTransform` that has a `TransformTranslator` and is supported (`TransformTranslator.canTranslate`) into its Spark correspondence. If a composite is not supported, it will be expanded further into its parts and translated then. \r\n     - Logically as is, but using the extended state.\r\n     - Also, this PR attempts to better distinguish between translation and evaluation. Instead of returning a translation context after the translation, this translation state is dropped as it is (mostly) not needed anymore. Only the necessary parts (leave datasets) are returned as `EvaluationContext`, that can be used to trigger the evaluation of the pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

default `GetSize` implementation for an SDF uses the `GetProgress` implementation of the restriction tracker and interpret it as bytes. The `TimestampRangeTracker` returns the time distance between the restriction `from` and either the restriction `end` or the current timestamp (when the `end` is not defined). \r\n\r\nThe `DetectNewPartitions` SDF only claims timestamps when partitions are scheduled. Because of this, and the above, the time gap increases for as long as there are no partitions scheduled. This makes the backlog bytes increase even when there is no data being output.\r\n\r\nThe `ReadChangeStreamPartition` SDF currently reports the size as the `Utf8` encoded bytes length of the record, multiplied by the time gap and a factor of `2`. This makes the size reported to be greater than the observed throughput.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we modify the size reporting of both SDFs to more accurately estimate the backlog bytes. This is used for the autoscaling strategy in Dataflow. The changes made here are:\r\n\r\n1. We estimate the size of the records and partitions using the Avro encoded bytes length instead of the `Utf8` encoded length.\r\n2. We removed the scaling factor from the `ReadChangeStreamPartition` SDF. The size is reported now as the `throughput in bytes * time gap`.\r\n3. We modified the `ThroughputEstimator` to use a smaller window (`10s` now, as opposed to `60s` before).\r\n4. We modified the `ThroughputEstimator` to calculate the throughput as the `bytes in the window / 10 (window size)`. This estimates the throughput in a per second basis, instead of the previous approach, where the denumerator was the number of seconds in the window with elements.\r\n5. We implemented the `GetSize` method for the `DetectNewPartitions` SDF to report the number of `partitions to be scheduled * average partition size record in bytes`.\r\n\r\nFixes

the v0 pass to add resource hints as mentioned in #23893.  \r\n\r\n* Adds resource package to manage hints, while enabling custom hints.\r\n* Adds --resource_hints flag with the same behavior as Beam Java and Python (tolerant of \"unknown\" hints)\r\n* Sets the hints on the default environment fields.\r\n* Minor improvements to test coverage.\r\n* Document the payload spec for the standard known resource hint urns in the proto.\r\n\r\nValidated that runners do respect the hints if desired, by having Dataflow Prime use a higher minimum bound of ram than default.\r\n\r\nAt this stage a user can use the flag from the command line, or manually set the flag to programatically change the pipeline level hints. However, this doesn't enable custom types that aren't in the \"beam:resources:\" URN namespace at this time. Once scoped resource hints are added, and multiple Go environments supported, the user will be able to derive custom hints as needed on whatever scoped side mechanism exists.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

there are various worker thread libraries in Node.js, the lack of a shared memory model makes it difficult to share caches, negating most of the benefit of trying to run multiple threads in the same process. In addition, having multiple independent workers connect to the control service is simpler (and possibly more efficient) than adding a proxying service within the javascript process.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Resolves #23939\r\n\r\nThis improvement was prepared by @vchunikhin and was kept in our local branch. We have been using it to develop frontend against unmerged backend branches.\r\n\r\nI cannot test it fully because per Vlad it takes ~30 minutes on his machine to get all runners up, and mine is not powerful enough. Still this is useful if some runners and frontend are commented out.\r\n\r\nI think this is better merged so it does not get outdated if living in our branch.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Accounts like Self-Hosted Runners and users with credentials can use the Remote Cache.\r\n* Changes were made to settings.gradle.kts to avoid impact to unauthenticated builds and environments, those will use local cache as default.\r\n* For runners with a valid account, remote cache will use previously configured gcloud credentials by default.\r\n* Service Accounts Keys in JSON format are also supported.\r\n* Cache is disabled for GitHub Hosted Agents workflows as not all of them have GCP credentials, also the relevant workflows will be migrated soon to Self-hosted runners which can use

Validate the params to check for required keys to fetch data for\r\n    change point analysis.\r\n  2. Initialize labels, min_runs_between_change_points,\r\n    num_runs_in_change_point_window. If they are passed in params,\r\n    override/append the default values with values in params.\r\n  3. Find most recent change point from the metric data of the\r\n      specified test+metric_name in params.\r\n  4. Find if the current observed change point is a duplicate/sibling change\r\n      point.\r\n      a. Check if the current observed change point lies in\r\n          num_runs_in_change_point_window.\r\n      b. Check if the current observed change point is a duplicate/sibling\r\n          change point of the last 10 reported change points for the current\r\n          test+metric_name\r\n  5. File an alert as a GitHub issue or GitHub issue comment if the\r\n      current observed change point is not a duplicate change point.\r\n  6. Publish the alerted GitHub issue metadata for BigQuery, This data is used\r\n      to determine whether a change point is duplicate or not.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: BQ read/write permission is needed for this PR to run.

PR addresses #21412 with a PubsubRowToMessage transform.\r\n\r\n## Validation logic\r\n\r\nPrior to processing `Row` inputs, it throws errors from `Schema` validation according to the following fields, where in the `Row` input:\r\n\r\n`attributes` - refers to the expected `Map<String, String>`\r\n`timestamp` - refers to the expected `ReadableDateTime`\r\n`payload` - refers to either the expected `FieldType.BYTES` or `TypeName.ROW`\r\n`user fields` - refers to any fields that are present in the `Row` input that are not `attributes`, `timestamp`, or `payload` fields\r\n`PayloadSerializer` - refers to the interface responsible for serializing a `Row` to `byte[]`\r\n\r\n_NOTE: `...` in the table below indicates that the value in the cell is irrelevant for the case_\r\n\r\n| attributes | timestamp | payload | user fields | PayloadSerializer | reason |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| not Map<String, String> | ... | ... | ... | ... | attributes are expected to match the same type as a `PubsubMessage` |\r\n| ... | not DATETIME | ... | ... | ... | the timestamp is expected to be derived from the Schema type |\r\n| ... | ... | not BYTES or ROW | ... | ... | we expect no other type but BYTES or ROW |\r\n| ... | ... | exists | exists | ... | providing the payload and user fields is incompatible |\r\n| ... | ... | BYTES | ... | not null | providing a PayloadSerializer in the context of payload BYTES is incompatible |\r\n| ... | ... | ROW | ... | null | PayloadSerializer is required to serialize payload ROW input |\r\n| ... | ... | ... | exist | null | PayloadSerializer is required to serialize a Row with user fields |\r\n\r\n## Timestamp logic\r\n\r\nThe following summarizes the logic when populating the stringified timestamp of the resulting `PubsubMessage`'s attributes, where in the `Row` input:\r\n\r\n`attributes` - refers to the expected `Map<String, String>`\r\n`timestamp` - refers to the expected `ReadableDateTime`\r\n`targetTimestampKey` - refers to the optional configuration parameter\r\n`sourceTimestampKey` - refers to the expected timestamp field name of the `Row` input\r\n\r\n_NOTE: `...` in the table below indicates that the value in the cell is irrelevant for the case_\r\n\r\n| user provided timestamp in attributes | timestamp | targetTimestampKey | result PubsubMessage attributes key | result PubsubMessage attributes value | reason |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| exists | ... | ... | sourceTimestampKey | value from Instant.now() | we only use the Row's timestamp field as input |\r\n| ... | exists | ... | sourceTimestampKey | value from Row input | we apply the stringified timestamp value to the PubsubMessage attributes using the sourceTimestampKey as its key |\r\n| ... | ... | exists | targetTimestampKey | ... | we use the configured key instead of the default sourceTimestampKey |\r\n| ... | absent | ... | ... | value from Instant.now() | when Row input lacks the timestamp we generate from Instant.now() |\r\n\r\n## Payload logic\r\n\r\nThe following summarizes the logic when populating the `byte[]` payload to a `PubsubMessage`, where in the `Row` input:\r\n\r\n`payload` - refers to either the expected `FieldType.BYTES` or `TypeName.ROW`\r\n`user fields` - refers to any fields that are present in the `Row` input that are not `attributes`, `timestamp`, or `payload` fields\r\n\r\n| payload | user fields | PubsubMessage byte[] | reason |\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\n| BYTES | absent | raw byte[] value from payload Field | no serialization is needed since the Row input already has the byte[] payload |\r\n| ROW | absent | serialized Row output from payload Field | serialization is applied using the PayloadSerializer |\r\n| absent | present | serialized Row output from user fields | serialization is applied to the Row using the PayloadSerializer resulting from user fields after removing the timestamp and attributes fields |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGitHub Actions Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n[![Build python source
