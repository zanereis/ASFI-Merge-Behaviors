Changed ShapeExpr->IndexExpr as it is mostly used for index\r\n- port conv2d from nnvm spec, with the following changes:\r\n   - kernel_size, channels are no longer mandatory\r\n   - layout->data_layout\r\n   - kernel_layout -> weight_layout(to be consistent with the weight, data argument name)\r\n   - bias is no longer attached to conv2d\r\n- Port layout.h into relay with minimum modification\r\n\r\nThis PR represents what is generally need to be done to port an NNVM operator to relay, most of the logic remains the same\r\n\r\n- Implement the TypeRelation function \r\n   - The shapes represented by IndexExpr(symbolic integer)\r\n   - User reporter->Assign to set the inferred result\r\n   - Use reporter->AssertEQ to assert symbolic integer equivalence\r\n      - It will return false if there is an unsatisfied constraint\r\n- Use tvm::Attrs to replace of dmlc::Parameter\r\n- We switch to directly create python wrappers by calling into positional functions so that the operator signature is explicit in python.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nAlthough I am not completely happy with the current python DSL API(relay.ir_builder).

PR contains a very minor fix and a modification in cmake.\r\n\r\n1. Enforce `NO_DEFAULT_PATH` when CUDA path is found. This particularly resolves my issue when building on the server in my university: when multiple CUDA versions exist, the original `FindCUDA.cmake` could possibly use incorrect `libcuda.so`.\r\n2. Print the dependencies found by FindXXXX explicitly. This could make it more friendly to developers who fail to build TVM due to dependency issues.\r\n\r\nI posted details of this issue on the TVM forum:

[RFC]: Relay IR Text Format\r\n\r\n**Please comment on syntax in #1782.**\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the Relay IR text format. It is intended to be used similarly to LLVM's text format. For example, a text format makes it easier to debug Relay programs and optimization passes as well as serve as a target language for machine learning front ends. \r\n\r\nThis PR will include\r\n\r\n- [x] An [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) grammar for the Relay IR text format.\r\n\r\n- [x] A parser that uses the grammar to produce a Relay AST.\r\n\r\n- [ ] A pretty printer that prints a Relay AST in text format. **Follow-up PR.**\r\n\r\nThe syntax is heavily inspired by LLVM, Rust, and ReasonML.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The ANTLR grammar accepts some programs that aren't valid Relay programs in order to have better error messages at parse time.","created_at":"2018-09-28T02:57:34Z","updated_at":"2018-12-02T18:35:29Z","closed_at":"2018-12-02T18:35:01Z","merged_at":"2018-12-02T18:35:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"d3bc59d20b7344cbfd4178deab678f79dd92220e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1781/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1781/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1781/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/533972bd6a5d99009c2680dead7f6d2ab7ae1891","head":{"label":"joshpoll:relay-text-format","ref":"relay-text-format","sha":"533972bd6a5d99009c2680dead7f6d2ab7ae1891","user":{"login":"joshpoll","id":21694516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjk0NTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21694516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll","html_url":"https://github.com/joshpoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":142378206,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDIzNzgyMDY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"joshpoll/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"joshpoll","id":21694516,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxNjk0NTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21694516?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll","html_url":"https://github.com/joshpoll","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joshpoll/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/joshpoll/tvm","description":"Open

is a fix for [the issue](https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/graph-fuse-x86-compilation-failed-with-some-schedules/846) found by @kevinthesun. \r\n\r\nIn #1608, I added a logic to prevent fusing injective ops with convolution or other non-broadcast ops. To do that, we detect a node which has both injective ops and non-broadcast ops as parents, and assigning group and master node ids appropriately.  \r\n\r\nBut I failed to address a case where the detected node has children nodes in the same group. In that case, we need to reassign master node id to children nodes as well, since otherwise they might still be pointing to a master node in a different group.\r\n\r\nThis issue could arise in a residual block with layout transform. There, layout transform, elemwise add, and relu ops can be fused, but not conv2d because layout transform is an injective op.  Before this PR, the correct fusion was happening, but relu op's master id was pointing to a conv2d op, which caused the issue @kevinthesun reported. This is hard to describe in words, but the test case added may clarify a bit. \r\n\r\n\r\n@kevinthesun @tqchen please review.","created_at":"2018-09-22T13:52:20Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T03:10:24Z","closed_at":"2018-09-25T03:10:12Z","merged_at":"2018-09-25T03:10:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"1de91d07539e2c62d00a405ceccd8cd620872316","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

previously TVM's Node system is backed by std::shared_ptr. As the system involves there is a need in bringing in some specific optimizations such as customize allocator, thread local object pool. This PR brings a step toward that change.\r\n\r\n- An intrusive smart-pointer NodePtr is introduced for TVM's node system\r\n- make_node is used in place of make_shared for the Node creation\r\n- make_node function leaves the chance for future optimizations.\r\n\r\nAs shown in the code refactor, the basic changes in code are to change shared_ptr<Node> to NodePtr<Node> and use make_node. This is only used in the node system, as the AST construction is the place where we might need performance optimizations, in other cases that need smart pointer, we still use shared_ptr","created_at":"2018-09-19T17:22:48Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T02:56:46Z","closed_at":"2018-09-20T02:56:46Z","merged_at":"2018-09-20T02:56:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"ae5a28dba45aaddf541d2ec581d0d14234a24567","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1739/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1739/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1739/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/dde129119e9afffe4d4d6764324b799e59ca6475","head":{"label":"tqchen:node","ref":"node","sha":"dde129119e9afffe4d4d6764324b799e59ca6475","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tv

change in runtime done by #990 broke models compiled by older version of tvm and nnvm. In older version of nnvm, storage ids for parameter nodes are all -1, and they are replaced by positive numbers at runtime. But #990 removed the id replacement at runtime and moved it to compile time. So running old models with a new runtime will cause seg fault, because storage ids are still -1.\r\n\r\nThis patch fix this issue. @tqchen please review.

strides are not specified, the `vload`, `vstore` stuff will calculate buffer offset as https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/src/lang/buffer.cc#L227-L239, but in tensorize, the tensor/buffer is passed from outside, with start address already includes the axes in the intrinsic, thus results the incorrect offset.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n```python\r\ndef intrinc(in, outs):\r\n  data = tvm.placeholder((d2,d3), dtype='uint8', name='data')\r\n  data.vload([i2, i3])\r\n\r\nInput = tvm.placeholder((d1, d2, d3))\r\ns[Input].tensorize(Input.axis[1], intrinc) \r\n```\r\nthen the start offset passed to `intrinc` is `(i1 * d2 + 0) * d3 + 0`, without strides, `vload` will (incorrectly) return offset `((i1 * d2 + 0) * d3 + i2) * d3 + i3`\r\n\r\nIt is confusing to users to understand, in most cases, tensorize results will be incorrect without binding a buffer with strides.\r\n\r\nWill come with test case and doc improvements.","created_at":"2018-09-17T17:09:35Z","updated_at":"2018-09-25T19:43:49Z","closed_at":"2018-09-23T22:04:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3b513c317f47cd8e2a5ae06b54c2a1d203eb4c8b","assignee":{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"ZihengJiang","id":17693755,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NjkzNzU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17693755?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang","html_url":"https://github.com/ZihengJiang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ZihengJiang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":963830470,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjM4MzA0NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20WIP","name":"status:

is the first part of the PR #1688. \r\n\r\nThis PR only focuses on making the runtime be able to take heterogeneous graphs. Changes are mainly made for graph runtime c++ and python interfaces.  Meanwhile, to test the execution, I manually created two simple graphs containing only addition, subtraction, and copy nodes. One test, test_simplex_data_transferring tests data transferring from GPU to CPU at runtime. The other one, test_duplex_data_transferring tests duplex data transferring back-and-forth between GPU and CPU. \r\n\r\nA new column, `device_type`, is added to the json file, which indicates which device a node should be scheduled to. In this PR this column is manually created as part of a graph json file. This field will be also used to annotate the graph node in the compiler PR. The serialization of this column is similar to that of the dtype column in the current json file. Loading/Saveing json API need to be modified slightly to support this field.\r\n\r\nTested the functionality on a MacBook with Intel CPU and Intel Graphics GPU for using the generated module in memory and exporting/importing it from the disk.\r\n\r\nThe next PR will focus on the compiler part to generate heterogeneous binaries to feed in the runtime. Major changes will be needed for the compiler.build interface. Another issue is the removal of `with target` statements in the high-level build interface.

Background\r\nCurrent TVM runtime takes the entire computation graph and imposes computation on it iteratively with the assumption that all operators are equally performant on the same backend. However, in reality, different backends may provide their own libraries to support various high performance operators. These operators are normally heavily optimized for a limited number of target devices, which sometimes makes efficient execution of a whole computation graph difficult in TVM. This PR proposes to design a mechanism to support heterogenous execution for TVM when multiple processors are present on the same hardware.\r\n\r\n## Major steps\r\n### 1. Context/device annotation\r\nAnnotation is implemented as a separate pass which could be invoked multiple times before and after some optimizations when necessary (like infershape/type).\r\nNodes will be annotated with the target information in this pass. It also helps us to 1) extract the target right before some optimizations (e.g. altering layout) and/or compute. This removes the \"with target\" in the build stage, 2) prevent across target operation fusion.\r\n\r\n### 2. Copy node insertion\r\nCopy node is designed as a special node that is inserted in the annotated graph. These nodes are very light, i.e. they don't need to be lowered and no fcompute/scheduled are needed. The runtime will detect this op and performs data copy directly.\r\n\r\n### 3. Compilation\r\nTVM will compile the annotated graph into multiple binaries depending on the number of devices needed. Each binary contains all the compiled (fused) operators for a specific target. We might be able to just use one binary, but I haven't investigated yet. However, only one json file and one param file will be generated.\r\n\r\n### 4. Runtime\r\nRuntime allocates memory for each node on different devices. Instead of only handling tvm_op, it also identifies copy op and performs data copy. \r\n\r\n### 5. TODO\r\n1. Currently, I have tested it on a MacBook with Intel Graphics processors and CPU using SSD (resnet50+multibox+nms) where nms is scheduled to CPU and everything else is on GPU. It seems the overhead of data transferring is extremely high. Need more investigation on it. \r\n2. The current default device is kDLOPENCL and users can specify operators from python API to CPU. We can probably have a config file containing all supported operators and specifying which operator should be scheduled to which device. In the future, we may want to have a more intelligent algorithm to decide effective annotation, therefore making annotation transparent to users.\r\n3. For build, we have `build_heterogenous` API because there is a \"with tophub\" in the `build` which cannot take multiple targets. Need to see how to move it so that only one API is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-05T07:24:06Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T18:19:42Z","closed_at":"2018-10-15T18:19:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5b5860e85b46f2ca2e0f67ef71232bd763182fc","assignee":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":963830470,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NjM4MzA0NzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20WIP","name":"status:
