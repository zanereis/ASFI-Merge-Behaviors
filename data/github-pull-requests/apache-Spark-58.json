What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn ad hoc queries we often need to limit the number of rows returned, if query is limit outside of window and the calculation of top k of the window function only depends on the rows with rank <= k, similar to top-k, we can insert node `WindowGroupLimit` to reduce shuffle. \r\n\r\nIt supports following pattern:\r\n```\r\nSELECT (... (row_number|rank|dense_rank|sum|max...)()\r\n    OVER (\r\nPARTITION BY ...\r\nORDER BY  ... ) AS v)\r\nLIMIT k\r\n```\r\nLimit k outside of window can be converted into top k for each window group, finally gobal limit k. The calculation of the top k values ​​after sorting for each window group only needs rows with partial rank <= k, so we can safely discard rows with partial rank > k, anywhere. \r\n`WindowGroupLimit` basically adds a per-window-group limit before and after the shuffle to reduce the input data of window processing .\r\nMore specifically, the before-shuffle per-window-group limit:\r\nadds an extra local sort to determine window group boundaries\r\napplies per-group limit to reduce the data size of shuffle, and all the downstream operators.\r\n\r\nWhether support inferring WindowGroupLimit from Limit outside of Window. That is the calculation of top k of the window function only depends on the rows with rank <= k. Check if: \r\n1. Window frame: first lower/upper must be 'UnboundedPreceding'/'CurrentRow', secondly window orderSpec exists unfoldable one or all window expressions are `RowFrame`. Because when orderSpec is foldable and window expressions is `RangeFrame`, aggregation calculation requires the use of all rows in the window group.\r\n2. Window function: All window expressions should not have `SizeBasedWindowFunction`, for example `CumeDist`, `NTile`, `PercentRank`. Because aggregation calculation of `SizeBasedWindowFunction` requires the use of all rows in the window group.\r\n3. The Limit could not be pushed down through Window. Because `LimitPushDownThroughWindow` have better performance than `WindowGroupLimit`.\r\n\r\nThe effect is similar to #38799. This is beneficial, assuming the per-window-group data size is large. Otherwise, the method to determine window group boundaries is pure overhead. The config `spark.sql.window.group.limit.threshold` could avoid the overhead if the per-window-group data size is small enough.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce the shuffle write to improve the performance. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemove _display_server_stack_trace and always display error stack trace if we have one\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere is a certain codepath which can make existing error handling fall into infinite recursion. I.e. consider following codepath:\r\n\r\n`[Some error happens] -> _handle_error -> _handle_rpc_error -> _display_server_stack_trace -> RuntimeConf.get -> SparkConnectClient.config -> [An error happens] -> _handle_error`.\r\n\r\nThere can be other similar codepaths\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nGets rid of occasionally infinite recursive error handling

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn a large data platform, it is very common to join different data types. Similar to [`reorderJoinPredicates`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b03afa7bde5a050eb95284b275eae0aac2257f63/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/exchange/EnsureRequirements.scala#L321-L338). This PR adds a function in `EnsureRequirements` to unwrap cast in join predicates to reduce shuffle if they are integral types.\r\n\r\nThe key idea here is that casting to either of these two types will not affect the result of join for integral types join keys. For example: `a.intCol = try_cast(b.bigIntCol AS int)`, if the value of `bigIntCol` exceeds the range of int, the result of `try_cast(b.bigIntCol AS int)` is `null`, and the result of  `a.intCol = try_cast(b.bigIntCol AS int)` in the join condition is `false`. The result is consistent with `cast(a.intCol AS bigint) = b.bigIntCol`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nReduce shuffle to improve query performance.\r\nCase 1: Shuffle before join\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t1(id int) USING parquet;\r\nCREATE TABLE t2(id int) USING parquet;\r\nCREATE TABLE t3(id bigint) USING parquet;\r\nSET spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold=-1;\r\nexplain SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id JOIN t3 ON t1.id = t3.id;\r\nexplain SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY id) AS rn FROM t1) t JOIN t2 ON t.id = t2.id WHERE rn = 1;\r\n```\r\nThe plan differences after this PR:\r\n```diff\r\n == Physical Plan ==\r\n AdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n-+- SortMergeJoin

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to restrict the supported charsets in the `decode()` functions by the list from [the doc](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/#decode):\r\n```\r\n'US-ASCII', 'ISO-8859-1', 'UTF-8', 'UTF-16BE', 'UTF-16LE', 'UTF-16'\r\n```\r\nand use the existing SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.javaCharsets` for restoring the previous behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently the list of supported charsets in `decode()` is not stable and fully depends on the used JDK version. So, sometimes user code might not work because a devop changed Java version in a Spark cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new checks:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z string-functions.sql\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-03T09:15:02Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T01:42:49Z","closed_at":"2023-12-04T01:42:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f8ad1639acc2fede2b64ac14eaac4af4d2c13c05","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44131/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44131/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44131/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/97895869bdf1d117c40dbc8408adc9a1b80af735","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:restrict-charsets-in-stringdecode","ref":"restrict-charsets-in-stringdecode","sha":"97895869bdf1d117c40dbc8408adc9a1b80af735","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR updates `CoalesceBucketsInJoin.satisfiesOutputPartitioning` to support matching `PartitioningCollection`. A common case is that we add an alias on the join key. For example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM   (SELECT /*+ BROADCAST(t3) */ t1.i AS t1i, t1.j AS t1j, t3.*\r\n        FROM   t1 JOIN t3 ON t1.i = t3.i AND t1.j = t3.j) t\r\n       JOIN t2 ON t.t1i = t2.i AND t.t1j = t2.j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe left side outputPartitioning is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(hashpartitioning(t1i#41, t1j#42, 8) or hashpartitioning(i#46, t1j#42, 8) or hashpartitioning(t1i#41, j#47, 8) or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr simplifies `s.c.MapOps.view.mapValues` using the following approach:\r\n\r\n- For the `s.c.immutable.MapOps` type, replace it with the `s.c.immutable.MapOps#transform` function.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndef transform[W](f: (K, V) => W): CC[K, W] = map { case (k, v) => (k, f(k, v)) }\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike the case in `CountMinSketchSuite`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0d40b1aea758b95a4416c8653599af8713a4aa16/common/sketch/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/util/sketch/CountMinSketchSuite.scala#L59\r\n\r\n\r\n- For the `s.c.MapOps` type, since the `transform` function does not exist for this type, replace it directly with the `map` function.\r\n\r\n```scala\r\ndef map[K2, V2](f: ((K, V)) => (K2, V2)): CC[K2, V2] = mapFactory.from(new View.Map(this, f))\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike the case in `KafkaTestUtils`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0d40b1aea758b95a4416c8653599af8713a4aa16/connector/kafka-0-10-sql/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/kafka010/KafkaTestUtils.scala#L381\r\n\r\n\r\n- For the `s.c.mutable.MapOps` type, the `transform` function has also been deprecated. At the same time, the signature of `transform` and its replacement function `mapValuesInPlace` is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n\r\n  @deprecated(\"Use mapValuesInPlace instead\", \"2.13.0\")\r\n  @inline final def transform(f: (K, V) => V): this.type = mapValuesInPlace(f)\r\n\r\n  def mapValuesInPlace(f: (K, V) => V): this.type = {...}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe target type of the value in the function is `V`, which is different from the target type of the value in `s.c.immutable.MapOps#transform`, which is `W`. This does not meet the desired requirement. So in this scenario, it can be divided into two sub-scenarios for handling:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If the `mutable.Map` are using needs to be eventually converted to an `immutable.Map`, first convert it to an `immutable.Map` and then use the `transform` function for replacement. Like the case in `SparkConnectPlanner`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0d40b1aea758b95a4416c8653599af8713a4aa16/connector/connect/server/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/connect/planner/SparkConnectPlanner.scala#L292\r\n\r\n2. If the `mutable.Map` are using does not need to be converted to an `immutable.Map` in the end, directly use the `map` function from `scala.collection.MapOps` for replacement. Like the case in `SparkSession`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0d40b1aea758b95a4416c8653599af8713a4aa16/connector/connect/client/jvm/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/SparkSession.scala#L313\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a special case in `PythonWorkerFactory`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/0d40b1aea758b95a4416c8653599af8713a4aa16/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/api/python/PythonWorkerFactory.scala#L381\r\n\r\nFor this case, it only needs to `destroy` each `Process` in `values` without returning any value. Therefore, it has been rewritten using `.values.foreach`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe coding pattern of `s.c.MapOps.view.mapValues` seems verbose, it can be simplified using other functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-12-02T10:30:01Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T05:27:14Z","closed_at":"2023-12-03T05:39:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2942c5f76b846d12c8b2289724d9b2ef0dfe14f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

read if they are integral types. The key idea here is that casting to either of these two types will not affect the result of join for integral types join keys. For example: `a.intCol = try_cast(b.bigIntCol AS int)`, if the value of `bigIntCol` exceeds the range of int, the result of `try_cast(b.bigIntCol AS int)` is `null`, and the result of `a.intCol = try_cast(b.bigIntCol AS int)` in the join condition is `false`. The result is consistent with `cast(a.intCol AS bigint) = b.bigIntCol`.\r\n\r\nAfter This PR:\r\n\r\n```\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\nAdaptiveSparkPlan isFinalPlan=false\r\n+- SortMergeJoin [i#6L],

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to refine the exception handling in SQL processor functions by replacing the general `Exception` class with more specific exception types.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current exception handling uses the broad `Exception` type, which can obscure the root cause of issues. By specifying more accurate exceptions, the code becomes clearer:\r\n\r\n- In `_get_local_scope()`, an `IndexError` is more appropriate as it explicitly handles the case where the index is out of range when accessing the call stack using `inspect.stack()`.\r\n- In `_get_ipython_scope()`, `AttributeError` and `ModuleNotFoundError` could occur if the IPython environment is not available or the expected attributes in the IPython shell object are missing.\r\n\r\nUsing these specific exceptions enhances the maintainability and readability of the code, making it easier for developers to understand and handle errors more effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing test suite `pyspark.pandas.tests.test_sql::SQLTests` should pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-12-02T01:48:37Z","updated_at":"2024-01-01T23:41:48Z","closed_at":"2023-12-03T05:42:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9336163112f2a60257f0a5d94b611e039fc5bca2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `PersistenceEngine` performance with `KryoSerializer` via introducing a new configuration, `spark.deploy.recoverySerializer`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAllow users to choose a better serializer to get a better performance in their environment. Especially, `KryoSerializer` is about **3x faster** than `JavaSerializer` with `FileSystemPersistenceEngine`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n================================================================================================\r\nPersistenceEngineBenchmark\r\n================================================================================================\r\n\r\nOpenJDK

When it was run as is (and not forcing Java version >= 14), the build would fail because it couldn't build different features that required Java >= 14.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn this path, we introduce a new switch that enable filtering partitions in Spark side, and then get target partitions by the high performance API `Hive#getPartitionsByNames`.\r\n1. Add a switch `spark.sql.hive.getPartitionByName.enabled` that enable doing partition filter in Spark and get partitions by name through HMS.\r\n2. Unify the `listPartitionsByFilter` call through `ExternalCatalogUtils` to make sure most partition prunes can use the new switch.\r\n3. Implement `listPartitionsByNames` api in different catalogs.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`Hive#getPartitionsByFilter` API is low-performance and would cause Hive MetaStore backend DBS suffer heavy load if there are many calls to tables containing many partitions. There are mainly two advantages of this path:\r\n1. Improve the performance of `listPartitionsByFilter` when querying tables containing large partitions.\r\n2. Reduce the load on the db behind Hive MetaStore and maintain the health of HMS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the user can turn on `spark.sql.hive.getPartitionByName.enabled` if the spark app needs do partition filter on tables containing large number of partitions. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a unit test.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is a response to a user complaint that stated that date to string casts are too slow if input string has many whitespace/isocontrol character as it's prefix or sufix.\r\n\r\nCurrent behaviour is that in StringToDate function we first call trimAll function to remove any whitespace/isocontrol chars. TrimAll creates new string and then we work against that string. This is not really needed since StringToDate can just simply skip these characters and do all the processing in single loop without extra allocations. Proposed fix is exactly that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThese changes should drastically improve edge case where input string in cast to date has many whitespace as prefix/sufix.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExtending existing tests to cover both prefix and suffix cases with whitespaces/control chars.\r\n\r\nThe change also includes a small unit benchmark for this particular case. Looking for feedback if we want to keep the benchmark, given that this is a rather esoteric edge case.\r\n\r\nThe benchmark measures time needed to do 10k calls of stringToDate function against a input strings that are in format <65k whitespace><correct_date><65 whitespace> and <correct_date><65k whitespace>. Here are the results:\r\n\r\n| input example | prior to change | after the change |\r\n| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |\r\n| 65k whitespace prefix + 65k suffix | 3250ms | 484ms |\r\n| 65k whitespace suffix | 1572ms | <1ms |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdds new client APIs to the Spark Connect Scala Client:\r\n- `def addArtifact(bytes: Array[Byte], target: String): Unit`\r\n- `def addArtifact(source: String, target: String): Unit`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently, without the use of a REPL/Class finder, there is no API to support adding artifacts (file-based and in-memory) \r\n with a custom target directory structure to the remote Spark Connect session. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nUsers can do the following for classfiles and jars:\r\n```scala\r\naddArtifact(\"/Users/dummyUser/files/foo/bar.class\", \"sub/directory/foo.class\")\r\naddArtifact(bytesBar, \"bar.class\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would preserve the directory structure in the remote server. In this case, the file would be stored under the directory:\r\n`$ROOT_SESSION_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY/classes/bar.class`\r\n`$ROOT_SESSION_ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY/classes/sub/directory/foo.class`\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `FileSystemPersistenceEngine.persist`'s error message in case of the existing file.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`FileSystemPersistenceEngine.persist` fails when a file exists in the location where `key` points.\r\nIt's helpful for us to distinguish this error from the normal file creation failures due to the other disk issues like, READ-ONLY mount.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This changes only a error message for a better UX.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test case.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-12-01T00:17:22Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T02:26:27Z","closed_at":"2023-12-01T02:20:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"97381e776d61a30db98a5b6fc53707bc2c1aeb3d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44100/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44100/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44100/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/29485859b45f8ffa1f762fa1e9950602607fb85a","head":{"label":"dongjoon-hyun:SPARK-46191","ref":"SPARK-46191","sha":"29485859b45f8ffa1f762fa1e9950602607fb85a","user":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677218341,"node_id":"R_kgDOKF2IJQ","name":"spark","full_name":"dongjoon-hyun/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dongjoon-hyun","id":9700541,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk3MDA1NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9700541?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun","html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dongjoon-hyun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dongjoon-hyun/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn various Pandas aggregate functions, remove each comparison or arithmetic operation between `DoubleType` and `IntergerType` in `evaluateExpression` and replace with a comparison or arithmetic operation between `DoubleType` and `DoubleType`.\r\n\r\nAffected functions are `PandasStddev`, `PandasVariance`, `PandasSkewness`, `PandasKurtosis`, and `PandasCovar`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese functions fail in interpreted mode. For example, `evaluateExpression` in `PandasKurtosis` compares a double to an integer:\r\n```\r\nIf(n < 4, Literal.create(null, DoubleType) ...\r\n```\r\nThis results in a boxed double and a boxed integer getting passed to `SQLOrderingUtil.compareDoubles` which expects two doubles as arguments. The scala runtime tries to unbox the boxed integer as a double, resulting in an error.\r\n\r\nReproduction example:\r\n```\r\nspark.sql(\"set spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false\")\r\nspark.sql(\"set spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=NO_CODEGEN\")\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nimport pyspark.pandas as ps\r\n\r\npser = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 7, 9, 8], index=np.random.rand(6), name=\"a\")\r\npsser = ps.from_pandas(pser)\r\n\r\npsser.kurt()\r\n```\r\nSee Jira (SPARK-46189) for the other reproduction cases.\r\n\r\nThis works fine in codegen mode because the integer is already unboxed and the Java runtime will implictly cast it to a double.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-30T23:19:36Z","updated_at":"2023-12-17T15:44:37Z","closed_at":"2023-12-01T02:28:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"75726b5d3fd557494a5a000122ac34a38f6cd322","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44099/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44099/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44099/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/907f8dc8ac9827b134441a502f872aceff12b968","head":{"label":"bersprockets:unboxing_error","ref":"unboxing_error","sha":"907f8dc8ac9827b134441a502f872aceff12b968","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nA race condition sending interrupt (or releaseSession) just after execute could cause:\r\n```\r\n[info]   org.apache.spark.SparkException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: \r\n[info]         operationId: fa653330-587a-41c7-a4a9-7987f070dcba with status Started\r\n[info]         is not within statuses List(Finished, Failed, Canceled) for

Closed\r\n[info]         is not within statuses List(Started, Analyzed, ReadyForExecution, Finished, Failed) for event Canceled\r\n```\r\nwhen the interrupt arrives before the thread in ExecuteThreadRunner is started.\r\n\r\nThis would cause in ExecuteHolder close:\r\n```\r\n      runner.interrupt() <- just sets interrupted = true\r\n      runner.join() <- thread didn't start yet, so join() returns immediately, doesn't wait for thread to be actually interrupted\r\n      ...\r\n      eventsManager.postClosed() <- causes the first failure, because thread wasn't running and didn't move to Canceled\r\n```\r\nAfterwards, assuming we allowed the transition, the thread will get started, and then want to immediately move to Canceled, notice the `interrupted` state. Then it would hit the 2nd error, not allowing Canceled after Closed.\r\n\r\nWhile we could consider allowing the first transition (Started -> Closed), we don't want any events to be coming after Closed, so that listeners can clean their state after Closed.\r\n\r\nFix is to handle interrupts coming before the thread started, and then prevent the thread from even starting if it was interruped.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis was detected after grpc 1.56 to 1.59 upgrade and causes some tests in SparkConnectServiceE2ESuite and ReattachableExecuteSuite to be flaky.\r\nWith the grpc upgrade, execute is eagerly sent to the server, and in some test we cleanup and release the session without waiting for the execution to start. This has triggered this flakiness. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest added. The test depends on timing, so may not fail reliably but only from time to time.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nGithub Copilot was assisting in some boilerplate auto-completion.\r\n\r\nGenerated-by: Github

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to change the implementation of interpretation mode of `StringDecode` and apparently of the `decode` function. And make it consistent to codegen. Both implementation raise the same error with of the error class `INVALID_PARAMETER_VALUE.CHARSET`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo make codegen and non-codegen of the `StringDecode` expression consistent. So, users will observe the same behaviour in both modes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, if user code depends on error from `decode()`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the following test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z string-functions.sql\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *.StringFunctionsSuite\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-30T16:48:51Z","updated_at":"2023-12-01T10:01:48Z","closed_at":"2023-12-01T09:42:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e440710bb197c9f319b4f85cacd526032de69bd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dcaa4f699676d9f75d805345a158bd267d63969c","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:align-codegen-stringdecode","ref":"align-codegen-stringdecode","sha":"dcaa4f699676d9f75d805345a158bd267d63969c","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis patch improves the error handling when errors are happening in the `AddArtifact` path. In particular, the `AddArtifactHandler` would not properly return exceptions but all exceptions would end up yielding `UNKNOWN` errors. This patch makes sure we wrap the errors in the add artifact path the same way as we're wrapping the errors in the normal query execution path.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it adds tests and verification for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWe found a race condition between lastTaskRunningTime and lastShuffleMigrationTime that could lead to a decommissioned executor exit before all the shuffle blocks have been discovered. The issue could lead to immediate task retry right after an executor exit, thus longer query execution time.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issue, we choose to update the lastTaskRunningTime only when a task updates its status to finished through the StatusUpdate event. This is better than the current approach (which use a thread to check for number of running tasks every second), because in this way we clearly know whether the shuffle block refresh happened after all tasks finished running or not, thus resolved the race condition mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo fix a race condition that could lead to shuffle data lost, thus longer query execution time.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is a very subtle race condition that is hard to write a unit test using current unit test framework. And we are confident the change is low risk. Thus only verify by passing all the existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to skip doctest `CrossValidatorTests.test_crossvalidator_with_fold_col` with Python 3.12.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- For the proper test for Python 3.12. It is failing, see SPARK-46177 and https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/7034467411/job/19154766502\r\n\r\n- Current dev torch version does not work very well with Python 3.12. It should be enabled together with SPARK-46078.\r\n\r\n- The build with Python 3.12 halts so can't see if other tests pass fine.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-30T00:37:18Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:51:02Z","closed_at":"2023-11-30T04:41:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"316d5a54fd353a0c33d7fa0e081f8ad6127abf03","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44086/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44086/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44086/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9c24cd5e513f3161cd3ee73264cf12a003fe2f51","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-46177","ref":"SPARK-46177","sha":"9c24cd5e513f3161cd3ee73264cf12a003fe2f51","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR introduces a new Python class `InputPartition` that represents the partition value returned by the `partitions` method in DataSourceReader.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBefore this PR, the `partitions` method can return anything, and it can be confusing to infer what is the `partition` argument in the `read(self, partition)` method.\r\n\r\nAdding `InputPartition` can make the Python data source API more intuitive and user-friendly. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCreate `CrossDbmsQueryTestSuite`, which extends `SQLQueryTestHelper` and `DockerIntegrationSuite`. `CrossDbmsQueryTestSuite` is a trait class that allows testing golden files against other DBMS.\r\n\r\n`PostgreSQLQueryTestSuite` is an implementation of `CrossDbmsQueryTestSuite`. For starters, sql files in the subquery sql-tests are automatically opted into this test. In this PR, all files except for `exists-having.sql` are ignored, otherwise this PR would have 10K+ line changes (I would like to do that in the next PR, if possible). I had to change the syntax for view creation in `exists-having.sql` slightly, and this is reflected in the `analyzer-results` file, but crucially, the query output (in the `results` file) are not changed.\r\n\r\nNote that this will not be applicable to many of the current sql tests we have due to:\r\n- Incompatible SQL syntax between spark sql and postgres.\r\n- Incompatible data types.\r\n- Difference in numerical precision with doubles.\r\n- Missing functions in either system.\r\n- Test files with specific configs, such as ANSI, count bug etc.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  3. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFor correctness checking of our SQLQueryTestSuites, we want to run SQLQueryTestSuites with Postgres as a reference DBMS. This can be easily extensible to other DBMS. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a test-related PR, does not affect system behaviors. \r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-29T21:56:13Z","updated_at":"2024-01-24T23:24:59Z","closed_at":"2024-01-05T03:37:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa970d9161e43704f6b8dfa646ff426ef6fdd1fb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jchen5","id":790409,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MDQwOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/790409?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5","html_url":"https://github.com/jchen5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jchen5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dtenedor","id":99207096,"node_id":"U_kgDOBenHuA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/99207096?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor","html_url":"https://github.com/dtenedor","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dtenedor/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44084/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44084/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44084/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/18f821f6e562a889b2cf1726935301b4d869edd8","head":{"label":"andylam-db:crossdbms","ref":"crossdbms","sha":"18f821f6e562a889b2cf1726935301b4d869edd8","user":{"login":"andylam-db","id":101158731,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgePSw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101158731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db","html_url":"https://github.com/andylam-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":479079175,"node_id":"R_kgDOHI4rBw","name":"spark","full_name":"andylam-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andylam-db","id":101158731,"node_id":"U_kgDOBgePSw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/101158731?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db","html_url":"https://github.com/andylam-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andylam-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andylam-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to update the description of the `Encode` expression and apparently the `encode()` function by describing the arguments `str` and `charset`. Also, renamed the parameter `value` to `str` according to the docs.\r\n\r\n#### The updated docs:\r\n<img width=\"724\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 12 04 17\"

The reason is wm is updated to 8000000, so stateKeyWatermarkPredicateFunc always returns true.\r\n\r\nlogs:\r\n```\r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\r\ncurrentBatchId = 0, lastExecutionRequiresAnotherBatch = false, isNewDataAvailable = true, shouldConstructNextBatch (with currbatchID) = true\r\nstateKeyWatermarkPredicateFunc: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 0)\r\nstateKeyWatermarkPredicateFunc: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 0)\r\nallKeyToNumValues.hasNext: false\r\n---------------removeByKeyCondition--------------- finished and return null\r\nallKeyToNumValues.hasNext: false\r\n---------------removeByKeyCondition--------------- finished and return null\r\nglobal watermark for batch ID 1 is set to 8000\r\ninput watermarks for batch ID 1 is set to HashMap(0 -> Some(8000), 1 -> Some(8000), 2 -> Some(8000))\r\n===hash=== shouldRunAnotherBatch: true watermarkHasChanged: true newInputWatermark: 8000 eventTimeWatermarkForEviction: 0 stateWatermarkPredicates: state cleanup [ left key predicate: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 0), right key predicate: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 0) ]\r\n===StateStoreSaveExec opid: 1=== shouldRunAnotherBatch: true, newInputWM: 8000 wm evict: 0\r\n===StateStoreSaveExec opid: 2=== shouldRunAnotherBatch: true, newInputWM: 8000 wm evict: 0\r\n \r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\r\n\r\ncurrentBatchId = 1, lastExecutionRequiresAnotherBatch = true, isNewDataAvailable = false, shouldConstructNextBatch (with currbatchID) = true\r\nstateKeyWatermarkPredicateFunc: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 8000000)\r\nstateKeyWatermarkPredicateFunc: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 8000000)\r\n===StateStoreSaveExec opid: 1 === remove key: [0,1000000018,0,0,4c4b40] value:[0,1800000018,1,0,0,4c4b40]\r\nwei==thisrow: [0,1800000018,1,0,0,4c4b40]\r\nthis row filtered: [0,1800000018,1,0,0,4c4b40]\r\ngetJoinedRows ------ key: [0,1000000018,0,0,4c4b40] numValues: 0\r\n!stateKeyWatermarkPredicateFunc(key): false !stateValueWatermarkPredicateFunc(thisRow): true\r\n===StateStoreSaveExec opid: 2 === remove key: [0,1000000018,0,0,4c4b40] value:[0,1800000018,5,0,0,4c4b40]\r\nwei==thisrow: [0,1800000018,5,0,0,4c4b40]\r\nthis row filtered: [0,1800000018,5,0,0,4c4b40]\r\ngetJoinedRows ------ key: [0,1000000018,0,0,4c4b40] numValues: 0\r\n!stateKeyWatermarkPredicateFunc(key): false !stateValueWatermarkPredicateFunc(thisRow): true\r\nallKeyToNumValues.hasNext: false\r\n---------------removeByKeyCondition--------------- finished and return null\r\nallKeyToNumValues.hasNext: false\r\n---------------removeByKeyCondition--------------- finished and return null\r\nglobal watermark for batch ID 2 is set to 8000\r\ninput watermarks for batch ID 2 is set to HashMap(0 -> Some(8000), 1 -> Some(8000), 2 -> None)\r\n===hash=== shouldRunAnotherBatch: false watermarkHasChanged: false newInputWatermark: 8000 eventTimeWatermarkForEviction: 8000 stateWatermarkPredicates: state cleanup [ left key predicate: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 8000000), right key predicate: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 8000000) ]\r\n===StateStoreSaveExec opid: 1=== shouldRunAnotherBatch: false, newInputWM: 8000 wm evict: 8000\r\n===StateStoreSaveExec opid: 2=== shouldRunAnotherBatch: false, newInputWM: 0 wm evict: 8000\r\n \r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\r\n\r\ncurrentBatchId = 2, lastExecutionRequiresAnotherBatch = false, isNewDataAvailable = false, shouldConstructNextBatch (with currbatchID) = false\r\n===hash=== shouldRunAnotherBatch: false watermarkHasChanged: false newInputWatermark: 8000 eventTimeWatermarkForEviction: 8000 stateWatermarkPredicates: state cleanup [ left key predicate: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 8000000), right key predicate: (input[0, struct<start:timestamp,end:timestamp>, false].end <= 8000000) ]\r\n===StateStoreSaveExec opid: 1=== shouldRunAnotherBatch: false, newInputWM: 8000 wm evict: 8000\r\n===StateStoreSaveExec opid: 2=== shouldRunAnotherBatch: false, newInputWM: 0 wm evict: 8000\r\n \r\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\r\n\r\ncurrentBatchId = 2, lastExecutionRequiresAnotherBatch = false, isNewDataAvailable = false, shouldConstructNextBatch (with currbatchID) = false\r\n\r\ncurrentBatchId = 2, lastExecutionRequiresAnotherBatch = false, isNewDataAvailable = false, shouldConstructNextBatch (with currbatchID) = false\r\n[info] - SPARK-45637 window agg + window agg -> join on window, append mode *** FAILED *** (8 seconds, 841 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   == Results ==\r\n[info]   !== Correct Answer - 1 ==              == Spark Answer - 0 ==\r\n[info]   !struct<_1:int,_2:int,_3:int,_4:int>   struct<>\r\n[info]   ![0,5,5,1]                             \r\n[info]       \r\n[info]   \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to update TODO comments within the Pandas API on Spark codebase, particularly those associated with missing parameter from DataFrame API.\r\n\r\nI also created SPARK-46156 which is umbrella JIRA to track the related tickets commented here.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor better tracking and management of pending tasks within the project.\r\n\r\nThere are many missing parameters especially `axis` which is widely used parameter from DataFrame API, so we should encourage contributors to easily identify, follow, and contribute to those outstanding issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should pass\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to hide the `More drop-down button` in the PySpark docs navigation bar.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBecause there is `only one item` under the `More drop-down button`, as following:\r\n<img width=\"1408\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/15246973/3597523c-a1b9-4932-9a0d-8b565d3e9015\">\r\n\r\nObviously, in our scenario, eliminating `More drop-down button` and directly displaying `Migration Guides menu` in the navigation bar is more intuitive and convenient.\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"1416\" alt=\"image\"

needed?\r\n\r\n- For the proper test for Python 3.12. It is failing, see SPARK-46149 and https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/7020654429/job/19100964890\r\n\r\n- Current dev torch version does not work very well with Python 3.12. It should be enabled together with SPARK-46078.\r\n\r\n- The build with Python 3.12 halts so can't see if other tests pass fine.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo,

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThere is a race condition case when using `spark.catalog.listTables`. It happens when one client is calling `listTables` while another client is delete some of the tables. In this case `listTables` might throw `TABLE_OR_VIEW_NOT_FOUND` when it tries to access a table or view that is deleted concurrently. \r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to improve `spark.catalog.listTables` not throw the exception but return normally.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is to improve user experience when using `spark.catalog.listTables` under the concurrent case. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor the following query:\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO tbl REPLACE WHERE id = (select c2 from values(1) as t(c2)) SELECT * FROM source\r\n```\r\nThere will be an analysis error:\r\n```\r\n[UNRESOLVED_COLUMN.WITHOUT_SUGGESTION] A column, variable, or function parameter with name `c2` cannot be resolved.  SQLSTATE: 42703; line 1 pos 51;\r\n'OverwriteByExpression RelationV2[id#27L, data#28] testcat.tbl testcat.tbl, (id#27L = scalar-subquery#26 []), false \r\n```\r\nThe error message is confusing. The actual reason is the OverwriteByExpression plan doesn't support subqueries. While supporting the feature is non-trivial, this PR is to improve the error message as\r\n```\r\n[UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE.OVERWRITE_BY_SUBQUERY] The feature is not supported: INSERT OVERWRITE with a subquery condition. SQLSTATE: 0A000; line 1 pos 43;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nError message improvement\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nNew UT\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to remove `dev/ansible-for-test-node` directory from `master` branch for Apache Spark 4.0.0 because it has been broken already.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis directory was a legacy for Spark 3.2.0 and older. Currently, it's not only unused, but also incompatible completely. Specifically, all Java/Python versions and K8s versions are incompatible. Definitely, there is no usage of this.\r\n- [Java

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr replaces `SQLContext` with `SparkSession` to clean up the use of the `SQLContext` API in the `hive-thriftserver` module and mark `SparkSQLEnv.sqlContext` as `deprecated`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`SQLContext` has been marked as `deprecated` since Apache Spark 1.6, and its APIs should be avoided as much as possible in Spark's internal code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch
