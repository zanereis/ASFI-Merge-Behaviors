Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>google/error-prone (com.google.errorprone:error_prone_core)</summary>\n\n### [`v2.35.1`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.35.1): Error Prone 2.35.1\n\nError Prone's dependency on protobuf has been downgraded to 3.25.5 for this release.\n\nVersion 3.25.5 of protobuf still fixes CVE-2024-7254. This release is provided for users who aren't ready to update to 4.x, see also [#&#8203;4584](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4584) and [#&#8203;4634](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4634). Future versions of Error Prone will upgrade back to protobuf 4.x.\n\nFull changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.35.0...v2.35.1\n\n### [`v2.35.0`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.35.0): Error Prone  2.35.0\n\nChanges:\n\n-   Fix handling of `\\s` before the trailing delimiter in [`MisleadingEscapedSpace`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MisleadingEscapedSpace)\n-   [`TimeUnitMismatch`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/TimeUnitMismatch) improvements: handle binary trees, consider trees like `fooSeconds * 1000` to have units of millis\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`JavaDurationGetSecondsToToSeconds`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/JavaDurationGetSecondsToToSeconds): Prefer `duration.toSeconds()` over `duration.getSeconds()`\n\nFull changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.34.0...v2.35.0\n\n### [`v2.34.0`](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/releases/tag/v2.34.0): Error Prone 2.34.0\n\nChanges:\n\n-   Passing the javac flag `--should-stop=ifError=FLOW` is now required when running Error Prone ([#&#8203;4595](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4595))\n-   The `MemberName` check was renamed to [`IdentifierName`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/IdentifierName)\n\nNew checks:\n\n-   [`FutureTransformAsync`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/FutureTransformAsync): The usage of transformAsync is not necessary when all the return values of the transformation function are immediate futures.\n-   [`MisformattedTestData`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MisformattedTestData): Reformats Java source code inside Error Prone test cases.\n-   [`MisleadingEscapedSpace`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/MisleadingEscapedSpace): Using `\\s` anywhere except at the end of a line in a text block is potentially misleading.\n-   [`ThrowIfUncheckedKnownUnchecked`](https://errorprone.info/bugpattern/ThrowIfUncheckedKnownUnchecked): `throwIfUnchecked(knownUnchecked)` is equivalent to `throw knownUnchecked`.\n\nClosed issues: [#&#8203;4595](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4595), [#&#8203;4598](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4598), [#&#8203;4620](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/4620)\n\nFull changelog: https://github.com/google/error-prone/compare/v2.33.0...v2.34.0\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>checkstyle/checkstyle (com.puppycrawl.tools:checkstyle)</summary>\n\n### [`v10.20.1`](https://redirect.github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/compare/checkstyle-10.20.0...checkstyle-10.20.1)\n\n### [`v10.20.0`](https://redirect.github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/compare/checkstyle-10.19.0...checkstyle-10.20.0)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/compare/checkstyle-10.19.0...checkstyle-10.20.0)\n\n### [`v10.19.0`](https://redirect.github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle/compare/checkstyle-10.18.2...checkstyle-10.19.0)\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"before 4am on Monday\" (UTC), Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

Error Prone 2.32.0\n\nThe minimum support JDK version to run Error Prone is now JDK 17 ([#&#8203;3803](https://redirect.github.com/google/error-prone/issues/3803)).\n\nUsing Error Prone to compile code that is deployed to earlier versions is still fully supported, but will requires using JDK 17 or newer for compilation and setting `--release` or `-source`/`-target`/`-bootclasspath`.\n\nFull

Description\r\n\r\nThis is to fix an NPE issue we are seeing in some of our test environments during COB in multi-tenant mode. \r\n\r\nPossible cause:\r\n\r\n- When running in multi-tenant mode, ES and IT COBs execute at the same time.\r\n- Both of these could somehow both be trying to access the business date value, causing NPE intermittently.\r\n\r\nIgnore if these details are present on the associated [Apache Fineract JIRA ticket](https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/1284).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request -

<a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1\">https://github.com/gradle/actions/compare/v4.0.0...v4.0.1</a></p>\n<h2>v4.0.0</h2>\n<p>Final release of <code>v4.0.0</code> of the <code>setup-gradle</code>, <code>dependency-submission</code> and <code>wrapper-validation</code> actions provided under <code>gradle/actions</code>.\nThis release is available under the <code>v4</code> tag.</p>\n<h2>Major changes from the <code>v3</code> release</h2>\n<h3>The <code>arguments</code> parameter has been removed</h3>\n<p>Using the action to execute Gradle via the <code>arguments </code>parameter was deprecated in <code>v3</code> and this parameter has been removed.\n<a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/v4.0.0-rc.1/docs/deprecation-upgrade-guide.md#using-the-action-to-execute-gradle-via-the-arguments-parameter-is-deprecated\">See here for more details</a>.</p>\n<h3>Cache cleanup enabled by default</h3>\n<p>After a number of fixes and improvements, this release enables <a href=\"https://github.com/gradle/actions/blob/v4.0.0-rc.1/docs/setup-gradle.md#configuring-cache-cleanup\">cache-cleanup</a> by default for all Jobs using the <code>setup-gradle</code> and <code>dependency-submission</code> actions.</p>\n<p>Improvements and bugfixes related cache cleanup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>By default, cache cleanup is not run if any Gradle build fails (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/71\">#71</a>)</li>\n<li>Cache cleanup is not run after configuration-cache reuse (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/19\">#19</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This feature should help to minimize the size of entries written to the GitHub Actions cache, speeding up builds and reducing cache usage.</p>\n<h3>Wrapper validation enabled by default</h3>\n<p>In <code>v3</code>, the <code>setup-gradle</code> action was enhanced to support Gradle wrapper validation, removing the need to use a separate workflow\nfile with the <code>gradle/actions/wrapper-validation</code> action.</p>\n<p>With this release, wrapper validation has been significantly improved, and is now enabled by default (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/12\">#12</a>):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>allow-snapshot-wrappers</code> makes it possible to validate snapshot wrapper jars using <code>setup-gradle</code>.</li>\n<li>Checksums for <a href=\"https://services.gradle.org/distributions-snapshots/\">nightly and snapshot Gradle versions</a> are now validated (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/281\">#281</a>).</li>\n<li>Valid wrapper checksums are cached in Gradle User Home, reducing the need to retrieve checksum values remotely (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/172\">#172</a>).</li>\n<li>Reduce network calls in <code>wrapper-validation</code> for new Gradle versions: By only fetching wrapper checksums for Gradle versions that were not known when this action was released, this release reduces the likelihood that a network failure could cause failure in wrapper validation (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/171\">#171</a>)</li>\n<li>Improved error message when <code>wrapper-validation</code> finds no wrapper jars (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/gradle/actions/issues/284\">#284</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Wrapper validation is important for supply-chain integrity. Enabling this feature by default will increase the coverage of wrapper\nvalidation on projects using GitHub Actions.</p>\n<h3>New input parameters for Dependency Graph generation</h3>\n<p>Some dependency-graph inputs that could previously only be configured via environment variables now have dedicated action inputs:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

the periods. \r\n\r\n[FINERACT-2117](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FINERACT-2117)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\nPlease make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your pull request -
