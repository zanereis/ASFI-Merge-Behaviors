to issue: #8453\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nThis PR is to fix 2 flaky tests `org.apache.dubbo.common.extension.ExtensionLoaderTest.test_AddExtension_Adaptive` \r\n and `org.apache.dubbo.common.extension.ExtensionLoaderTest.test_AddExtension_NoExtend` \r\n- The 2 tests do not reset `ExtensionLoader` after running, which pollutes the state shared among tests and can lead to `IllegalStateException`.\r\n- It may be better to clean state pollutions so that some other tests won't fail in the future due to the shared state pollution.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Reset `ExtensionLoader` when the tests end.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWith the proposed fix, the tests do not pollute the shared state (and pass when multiple tests that use this state are run in the same JVM).\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Catch and ignore all exception when destroying\r\n2. Update the log level in testcases\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-09T11:27:47Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T14:13:16Z","closed_at":"2021-08-10T11:37:49Z","merged_at":"2021-08-10T11:37:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"8bc6144938fdecd69893574d8d428e0c6e159cdd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/42","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42/labels","id":7059958,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Aa7n2","number":42,"title":"3.0.3","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":61,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-15T14:12:33Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z","due_on":"2021-09-12T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8459/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8459/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8459/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/60909d5fa80f396cf541fec59e6ba115ebdb3ca1","head":{"label":"pinxiong:issue#8459","ref":"issue#8459","sha":"60909d5fa80f396cf541fec59e6ba115ebdb3ca1","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix dubbo 3.0 use triple can not return real exception #8363 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n- use hessian2 wrapper java exception\r\n- add common exception structure for multi-language \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-09T09:08:44Z","updated_at":"2021-09-23T10:23:20Z","closed_at":"2021-08-11T07:57:32Z","merged_at":"2021-08-11T07:57:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"6808f8f104f325bf92cb9715c8c50eaa10ce18eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/42","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42/labels","id":7059958,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Aa7n2","number":42,"title":"3.0.3","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":61,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-15T14:12:33Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z","due_on":"2021-09-12T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8458/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8458/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8458/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cdc2c295a4628af0e72925b7152864a53946442f","head":{"label":"EarthChen:fix/triple-exception","ref":"fix/triple-exception","sha":"cdc2c295a4628af0e72925b7152864a53946442f","user":{"login":"EarthChen","id":20179425,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTc5NDI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20179425?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen","html_url":"https://github.com/EarthChen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/EarthChen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:3.0","ref":"3.0","sha":"0a07eaee651a263fd05c1b173b29ed220539d4dd","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-09T08:45:06Z","updated_at":"2021-08-19T04:22:37Z","closed_at":"2021-08-15T14:23:04Z","merged_at":"2021-08-15T14:23:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"a9d3c4a77fde41c3c90217f836574cc3cd990e8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/42","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/42/labels","id":7059958,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Aa7n2","number":42,"title":"3.0.3","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":61,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-15T14:12:33Z","updated_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z","due_on":"2021-09-12T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-10-08T15:42:39Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8455/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8455/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8455/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/315ce12a4904772d1eeea056a124712b37860186","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:3.0_feature/refactor_referenceconfig","ref":"3.0_feature/refactor_referenceconfig","sha":"315ce12a4904772d1eeea056a124712b37860186","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-08T14:12:30Z","updated_at":"2021-08-09T03:46:57Z","closed_at":"2021-08-09T03:46:57Z","merged_at":"2021-08-09T03:46:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"eec80a861a969f8b525211af9875e9816c94b5cc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8449/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8449/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8449/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0ba8ba64b6508cf5ab5075b3ce6b45ddd0c1fd54","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0808_fix_serialization","ref":"0808_fix_serialization","sha":"0ba8ba64b6508cf5ab5075b3ce6b45ddd0c1fd54","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nI noticed that there is a test subclass [MethodConfig](https://github.com/wx930910/dubbo/blob/master/dubbo-config/dubbo-config-api/src/test/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/AbstractMethodConfigTest.java#L123) extends production class [AbstractMethodConfig](https://github.com/wx930910/dubbo/blob/321789d8131f5a3769b240c9304ea468eae48d61/dubbo-common/src/main/java/org/apache/dubbo/config/AbstractMethodConfig.java#L28) to test the parent production class. This might not be the best priactice in unit testing and can be improved by leveraging mocking frameworks.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Replace MethodConfig with spying objects created by Mockito.\r\n\r\n<!-- ## Verifying this change -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-08T05:59:28Z","updated_at":"2024-09-18T10:08:39Z","closed_at":"2021-08-15T09:45:24Z","merged_at":"2021-08-15T09:45:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"27d834f6ace9d5a1d9f5600be1d037979228923a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8446/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8446/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8446/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c1c1033788715622f6d8b7e59933f316f441eb4c","head":{"label":"wx930910:refactor-AbstractMethodConfigTest","ref":"refactor-AbstractMethodConfigTest","sha":"c1c1033788715622f6d8b7e59933f316f441eb4c","user":{"login":"wx930910","id":22060531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDYwNTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22060531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910","html_url":"https://github.com/wx930910","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":307525156,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDc1MjUxNTY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wx930910/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wx930910","id":22060531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDYwNTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22060531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910","html_url":"https://github.com/wx930910","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wx930910/dubbo","description":"Apache

parent production class. This might not be the best priactice in unit testing and can be improved by leveraging mocking frameworks.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- Replace MethodConfig with spying objects created by Mockito.\r\n\r\n<!-- ## Verifying this change -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-08T05:35:06Z","updated_at":"2021-08-08T05:55:30Z","closed_at":"2021-08-08T05:55:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8445/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8445/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8445/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c1c1033788715622f6d8b7e59933f316f441eb4c","head":{"label":"wx930910:refactor-AbstractMethodConfigTest","ref":"refactor-AbstractMethodConfigTest","sha":"c1c1033788715622f6d8b7e59933f316f441eb4c","user":{"login":"wx930910","id":22060531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDYwNTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22060531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910","html_url":"https://github.com/wx930910","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":307525156,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDc1MjUxNTY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"wx930910/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wx930910","id":22060531,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMDYwNTMx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22060531?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910","html_url":"https://github.com/wx930910","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wx930910/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wx930910/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nAs we know , most micro services are built based on cloud.However, there are several factors that affect the service，for instance cpu steal ,network jitter and so on. LoadBalance should be more sensitive with running time of invoker when bad thing happens. ShortestResponseLoadBalance works not well for service has start for a long time so that average elapsed time  changed little  according to my past practice.Sliding window may be a good choice to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nAverage elapsed time depends on statistics in sliding window. Once sliding window is end,a async thread will clear past data of all invokers, which I have thought for a long time. Segmented execution seems a good practice, but it would bring some potential risks.How about giving me some advice?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own

Update unnecessary multiple zookeeper instances to single zookeeper instance\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-06T13:56:02Z","updated_at":"2021-08-07T14:31:15Z","closed_at":"2021-08-07T14:31:15Z","merged_at":"2021-08-07T14:31:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"e86cfcfa0e2c4022aecdfad95b992c6e378abc80","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8435/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8435/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8435/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/abc4d13680c1083239dd8a97fdcc8969b22d3a4a","head":{"label":"haoyann:fix-mesh-npx","ref":"fix-mesh-npx","sha":"abc4d13680c1083239dd8a97fdcc8969b22d3a4a","user":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340824984,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4MjQ5ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"haoyann/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann/dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-06T08:09:17Z","updated_at":"2021-08-06T10:36:16Z","closed_at":"2021-08-06T10:36:10Z","merged_at":"2021-08-06T10:36:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"2f099bddd19b2cd887c15ee0ac2cba98cda837bf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/41","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/41","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/41/labels","id":7037396,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Aa2HU","number":41,"title":"3.0.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":1,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-06T07:53:35Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T14:12:14Z","due_on":"2021-08-21T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-08-15T14:12:14Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8434/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8434/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8434/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4e8bd522cc0c28ece028f691b939e8e98ad8ebd1","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0806_fix_javaassist_private","ref":"0806_fix_javaassist_private","sha":"4e8bd522cc0c28ece028f691b939e8e98ad8ebd1","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nsee #8417 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Refactor the previous source code for checking Injvm protocol in single registry center\r\n2. Verify the exported services through the custom ServiceListener in multiple registry center\r\n3. Verify the exported exporters through the custom ExporterListener in multiple registry center\r\n4. Verify the filter chain through the custom Filter in multiple registry center\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-02T15:16:31Z","updated_at":"2021-08-03T03:23:47Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T03:23:47Z","merged_at":"2021-08-03T03:23:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"94110c0e65f685af0e88b07f9587bca03b64cf9b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8402/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8402/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8402/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ea088ad24fb7e30be17f7d9a9f53fcd9f90fd37f","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0802_fix_metadata","ref":"0802_fix_metadata","sha":"ea088ad24fb7e30be17f7d9a9f53fcd9f90fd37f","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

to issue: #8390\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR is to fix a non-idempotent test `org.apache.dubbo.rpc.filter.ExecuteLimitFilterTest.testExecuteLimitInvokeWitException` \r\n- The test does not remove `RpcStatus` after running, which pollutes the state shared among tests.\r\n- It may be better to clean state pollutions so that some other tests won't fail in the future due to the shared state pollution.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\nRemoves the status of RPC when the test ends.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWith the proposed fix, the test does not pollute the shared state (and passes when run twice in the same JVM).\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-02T07:02:53Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T15:26:35Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T12:23:51Z","merged_at":"2021-08-03T12:23:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"a94a059376ad76dd4569e80dd8be0585b58b83d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/7667c9a088736ec27d79fc94681cf2b63ef4c186","head":{"label":"pinxiong:issue#8394","ref":"issue#8394","sha":"7667c9a088736ec27d79fc94681cf2b63ef4c186","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-02T01:29:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-13T10:19:09Z","closed_at":"2021-08-03T12:21:35Z","merged_at":"2021-08-03T12:21:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"2982234ea34bdffab3bc4b8b8b5cf4311cc76f18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/312f5180226480fae2c016d1e53bd8df739d7bfe","head":{"label":"haoyann:configcenter-security","ref":"configcenter-security","sha":"312f5180226480fae2c016d1e53bd8df739d7bfe","user":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340824984,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4MjQ5ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"haoyann/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-08-01T13:45:06Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T10:46:26Z","closed_at":"2021-08-04T10:46:26Z","merged_at":"2021-08-04T10:46:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"d1f100e14ed0e35f2a840b7969ab20fce5017e3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8386/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8386/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8386/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/78bdebf5cd1bd98ce2ee883e0cb0a0259c9030bf","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0801_upgrade_hessianlite","ref":"0801_upgrade_hessianlite","sha":"78bdebf5cd1bd98ce2ee883e0cb0a0259c9030bf","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large,

for other config, like mock ,it works as well.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-30T11:24:43Z","updated_at":"2021-08-15T14:18:00Z","closed_at":"2021-08-15T14:18:00Z","merged_at":"2021-08-15T14:18:00Z","merge_commit_sha":"6acd5a2a935c41c3f0b29ad9dce0d7e14586fded","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/43","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/43","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/43/labels","id":7059960,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAEfiCM4Aa7n4","number":43,"title":"2.7.14","description":"","creator":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":4,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-08-15T14:16:56Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T01:54:45Z","due_on":"2021-09-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2021-09-21T01:54:45Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8379/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8379/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8379/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/51219ce96d7bc16a3b3164dc341bf3494971c306","head":{"label":"24kpure:i8378","ref":"i8378","sha":"51219ce96d7bc16a3b3164dc341bf3494971c306","user":{"login":"24kpure","id":14272651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjcyNjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14272651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure","html_url":"https://github.com/24kpure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":379892862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNzk4OTI4NjI=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"24kpure/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"24kpure","id":14272651,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjcyNjUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14272651?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure","html_url":"https://github.com/24kpure","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/24kpure/orgs","repos_url":"ht

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix #8249\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-30T07:30:25Z","updated_at":"2021-08-01T01:50:49Z","closed_at":"2021-08-01T01:50:49Z","merged_at":"2021-08-01T01:50:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"84078a55fcf1b45cdb6a2dedd5af99ad39d4f3bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8376/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8376/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8376/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/70c6cae6a3ea4911782de411543dda72b3ded11d","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0730_fix_metadata","ref":"0730_fix_metadata","sha":"70c6cae6a3ea4911782de411543dda72b3ded11d","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-29T07:13:23Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T04:51:19Z","closed_at":"2021-07-29T07:15:04Z","merged_at":"2021-07-29T07:15:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"b48b7924fb087ac648d05b4e35b87f00dee0aada","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8369/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8369/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8369/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/62c9e1dbb255ccc79769636d33632b47cb5276e6","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-support-disable-shutdown-hook","ref":"3.0-support-disable-shutdown-hook","sha":"62c9e1dbb255ccc79769636d33632b47cb5276e6","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix migrationRule bug\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-27T07:58:46Z","updated_at":"2021-07-27T10:24:54Z","closed_at":"2021-07-27T10:24:54Z","merged_at":"2021-07-27T10:24:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"bfa4b3bb6660d404c0715f54f8743dda45b46909","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8358/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8358/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8358/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d27593a37abf9bd407262e9104656e0833194b14","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-migration","ref":"up-dev-issue-migration","sha":"d27593a37abf9bd407262e9104656e0833194b14","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-25T08:26:26Z","updated_at":"2021-07-26T01:57:30Z","closed_at":"2021-07-26T01:57:30Z","merged_at":"2021-07-26T01:57:30Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f3cea771e158c443ea3c3d7ef2c94f8a982ae35","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8351/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8351/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8351/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/afc33cef977cea63021451b0c21ea21d0e7cca98","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0725_dependency_upgrade","ref":"0725_dependency_upgrade","sha":"afc33cef977cea63021451b0c21ea21d0e7cca98","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-25T07:35:38Z","updated_at":"2021-08-04T10:46:39Z","closed_at":"2021-08-04T10:46:39Z","merged_at":"2021-08-04T10:46:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"c125b99189650b2f3ae148fb19c970435bba3563","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8350/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8350/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8350/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b5e3f89fd5441558e93b14f4fe31bccf6abddee7","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:0720_add_k8s_mesh_support","ref":"0720_add_k8s_mesh_support","sha":"b5e3f89fd5441558e93b14f4fe31bccf6abddee7","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

[dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-25T04:42:48Z","updated_at":"2021-07-27T03:11:11Z","closed_at":"2021-07-27T03:11:11Z","merged_at":"2021-07-27T03:11:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"b142cdb216911b5fedcbd60fdde1aaba75383a3b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8348/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8b5923e3ab97ad87dea5bab1af8618c1994fb462","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-8341","ref":"up-dev-issue-8341","sha":"8b5923e3ab97ad87dea5bab1af8618c1994fb462","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-24T07:25:28Z","updated_at":"2021-07-24T14:00:26Z","closed_at":"2021-07-24T14:00:26Z","merged_at":"2021-07-24T14:00:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"c28ca24475f92e4828e75a02e5a505403c68979a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7331964,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzMxOTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Bugs

and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-22T17:43:24Z","updated_at":"2022-03-16T02:38:15Z","closed_at":"2022-03-16T02:38:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5748495ba885335badf8854dca8eeb6af7391ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8340/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8340/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8340/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/30eea81b9d92e44bfdec866ac386943b9721d96c","head":{"label":"hengyoush:up-dev-issue-8292","ref":"up-dev-issue-8292","sha":"30eea81b9d92e44bfdec866ac386943b9721d96c","user":{"login":"hengyoush","id":32724602,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNzI0NjAy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32724602?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush","html_url":"https://github.com/hengyoush","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyoush/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"352a0df89d29a1abad1adc3086434580e4c78b90","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-21T11:26:32Z","updated_at":"2021-07-28T05:45:06Z","closed_at":"2021-07-28T05:45:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3438cd3a20f5e022d69b0e922daededfc93539a2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8331/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8331/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8331/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5e8a9826ddb177bee08fbb813fee392c55442147","head":{"label":"owen200008:PojoUtils_support_bytearray","ref":"PojoUtils_support_bytearray","sha":"5e8a9826ddb177bee08fbb813fee392c55442147","user":{"login":"owen200008","id":7434837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzQ4Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7434837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008","html_url":"https://github.com/owen200008","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":283376913,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODMzNzY5MTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"owen200008/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"owen200008","id":7434837,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MzQ4Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7434837?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008","html_url":"https://github.com/owen200008","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/owen200008/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/owen200008/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-21T09:01:07Z","updated_at":"2021-07-30T02:16:18Z","closed_at":"2021-07-30T02:16:18Z","merged_at":"2021-07-30T02:16:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"a40a90928c9b89f243a2f5c1110d9de72b8ac1aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4c1c4a927c7f16e957562529fe2de4345946be0f","head":{"label":"haoyann:change-mesh-group","ref":"change-mesh-group","sha":"4c1c4a927c7f16e957562529fe2de4345946be0f","user":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":340824984,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDA4MjQ5ODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"haoyann/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haoyann","id":43994656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTk0NjU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43994656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann","html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haoyann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haoyann/dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-19T15:33:31Z","updated_at":"2021-07-30T02:34:22Z","closed_at":"2021-07-30T02:34:21Z","merged_at":"2021-07-30T02:34:21Z","merge_commit_sha":"e5aaeffbe317b083e966235855c8e17e91efa759","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"horizonzy","id":22524871,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTI0ODcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22524871?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy","html_url":"https://github.com/horizonzy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/horizonzy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8320/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8320/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8320/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8ef59089508e4f641049f569c1d67d6d91913bd9","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-8317-3.0","ref":"up-dev-issue-8317-3.0","sha":"8ef59089508e4f641049f569c1d67d6d91913bd9","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-18T09:55:12Z","updated_at":"2021-10-17T12:14:41Z","closed_at":"2021-10-17T12:14:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f18bd1306b9f7d2c5ec3949540b19bea021e8ca7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

[GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-18T04:31:26Z","updated_at":"2021-10-17T14:24:17Z","closed_at":"2021-10-17T14:24:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"03a53a4f6fe51109689189e7c563f351bfd08177","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-15T15:52:02Z","updated_at":"2021-07-29T14:18:23Z","closed_at":"2021-07-16T02:18:24Z","merged_at":"2021-07-16T02:18:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"feb9e41cb355ed06a77c135f6c3b42f7c2cb0f42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8302/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8302/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8302/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ecbf47ff40277d1b9da324bb65c95d8048c94483","head":{"label":"pinxiong:issue#8301","ref":"issue#8301","sha":"ecbf47ff40277d1b9da324bb65c95d8048c94483","user":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":349733065,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDk3MzMwNjU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"pinxiong/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"pinxiong","id":7067417,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjc0MTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7067417?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong","html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pinxiong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/pinxiong/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-15T09:50:59Z","updated_at":"2021-07-16T02:17:26Z","closed_at":"2021-07-16T02:17:26Z","merged_at":"2021-07-16T02:17:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"676f5eb61032aa38f3273a581e6316d7fc264e0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8300/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8300/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8300/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/49b847d4fab729ba2439166e27d25ae9a3044dc4","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:3.0_add_config_listener","ref":"3.0_add_config_listener","sha":"49b847d4fab729ba2439166e27d25ae9a3044dc4","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

-->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-14T07:32:14Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T04:51:12Z","closed_at":"2021-07-16T02:17:58Z","merged_at":"2021-07-16T02:17:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"a5737d1625259837cff4555b94ac92301eb56642","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5fb6ab332d44704c46303a7fc220708fdbea9a5e","head":{"label":"kylixs:3.0-remove-lock-of-config-manager-0713","ref":"3.0-remove-lock-of-config-manager-0713","sha":"5fb6ab332d44704c46303a7fc220708fdbea9a5e","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-13T16:04:01Z","updated_at":"2021-07-15T10:52:42Z","closed_at":"2021-07-15T10:52:41Z","merged_at":"2021-07-15T10:52:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"0631e705def9e9e25df3d56d17407a5fd83a7846","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8286/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8286/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8286/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/48f849b747af169e1c1735bd79b0344362afc02f","head":{"label":"xiaoheng1:up-dev-issue-8285-3.0","ref":"up-dev-issue-8285-3.0","sha":"48f849b747af169e1c1735bd79b0344362afc02f","user":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":187745345,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODc3NDUzNDU=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoheng1","id":12539730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTM5NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12539730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoheng1/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoheng1/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

Follow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily: -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [x] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GitHub issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Check if is necessary to patch to Dubbo 3 if you are work on Dubbo 2.7\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Add some description to [dubbo-website](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-website) project if you are requesting to add a feature.\r\n- [ ] GitHub Actions works fine on your own branch.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-07-13T00:06:21Z","updated_at":"2021-07-13T11:29:26Z","closed_at":"2021-07-13T11:29:26Z","merged_at":"2021-07-13T11:29:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"590a7e57669ac4ef1982313f413f6bf8091bcc0a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8277/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/8277/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/8277/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d2447b1a5cdf1e960314aec3bce8c64f641543a2","head":{"label":"sh1yu:fix_endpoint","ref":"fix_endpoint","sha":"d2447b1a5cdf1e960314aec3bce8c64f641543a2","user":{"login":"sh1yu","id":4922741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjI3NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4922741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu","html_url":"https://github.com/sh1yu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":385301268,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODUzMDEyNjg=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"sh1yu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sh1yu","id":4922741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5MjI3NDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4922741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu","html_url":"https://github.com/sh1yu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sh1yu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sh1yu/dubbo","description":"Apache
