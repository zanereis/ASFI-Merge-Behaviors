enabled dependabot to bump dependencies for various Python requirements we have in Airflow and it found out that we have pretty out-dated hatch - pinned because of metadata stability when building packages. The update caused \"get-workflow-info\" step in CI to fail because the \"get-workflow-info\" commmand contained output from uv upgrading breeze while it was running.\r\n\r\nThis PR bumps the version manually to the latest version, also it sets `SKIP_BREEZE_SELF_UPGRADE_CHECK` variable to true in the `get-workflow-info` step - to prevent breeze from checking and automatically upgrading itself.\r\n\r\nThis will not make future dependabot PRs to succeed, because those PRs will not update hash of README file - so the PRs will fail at the pre-commit stage, but at least it will be clear what should be done to fix it.\r\n\r\nAlso a bit of cleanup has been done opportunistically:\r\n\r\n* the TODO on flit automation can now be removed as we have dependabot taking care about it automatically in both places that we were supposed to automate\r\n\r\n* the importlib_resources exclusions were only used for Python < 3.9 and we are now >= 3.0 so we can remove it\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

automountServiceAccountToken: true in a Kubernetes Pod's specification ensures that the pod automatically mounts a service account token, granting it access to the Kubernetes API. While this is necessary for applications that interact with the API, enabling this feature indiscriminately can introduce several security risks:\r\n\r\n**Excessive Permissions**: By default, the mounted service account token may have broader permissions than the pod requires. If an attacker compromises the pod, they could exploit these permissions to perform unauthorized actions within the cluster. \r\n\r\n**Privilege Escalation**: A compromised pod with an automatically mounted service account token can interact with the Kubernetes API, potentially allowing an attacker to escalate privileges and gain control over additional cluster resources. \r\n\r\n**Increased Attack Surface**: Mounting the service account token into a pod's filesystem increases the pod's attack surface, making it more susceptible to security breaches. \r\n\r\nBest Practices:\r\n\r\nDisable Automatic Mounting : Set automountServiceAccountToken: false for pods that do not require interaction with the Kubernetes API. This minimizes the risk by ensuring that only pods needing API access have the token mounted.

: #44876\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `SqsPublishOperator` in Airflow does not support the `MessageDeduplicationId` parameter for deduplication of messages sent to AWS SQS FIFO queues. Users are forced to rely solely on `ContentBasedDeduplication`, which may not be suitable for all scenarios. \r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add support for `MessageDeduplicationId ` and test for deduplication to provide more flexibility and control over message deduplication.\r\n\r\n(https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/1.35.6/reference/services/sqs/client/send_message.html))\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Fixed some bugs in the way related to Connection parsing/serializing!\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, we have following Connection related objects:\r\n- `ConnectionResponse` is auto-generated and tightly coupled with the API schema.\r\n- `ConnectionResult` is runtime-specific and meant for internal communication between Supervisor & Task Runner.\r\n- `Connection` class here is where the public-facing, user-relevant aspects are exposed, hiding internal details.\r\n\r\n**Next up**:\r\n\r\n- Same for XCom & Variable\r\n- Implementation of BaseHook.get_conn\r\n\r\nTested it with a DAG:\r\n\r\n<img

enabled dependabot to bump dependencies for various Python requirements we have in Airflow and it found out that we have pretty out-dated hatch - pinned because of metadata stability when building packages. The update caused \"get-workflow-info\" step in CI to fail because the \"get-workflow-info\" commmand contained output from uv upgrading breeze while it was running.\r\n\r\nThis PR bumps the version manually to the latest version, also it sets `SKIP_BREEZE_SELF_UPGRADE_CHECK` variable to true in the `get-workflow-info` step - to prevent breeze from checking and automatically upgrading itself.\r\n\r\nThis will not make future dependabot PRs to succeed, because those PRs will not update hash of README file - so the PRs will fail at the pre-commit stage, but at least it will be clear what should be done to fix it.\r\n\r\nAlso a bit of cleanup has been done opportunistically:\r\n\r\n* the TODO on flit automation can now be removed as we have\r\n  dependabot taking care about it automatically in both places\r\n  that we were supposed to automate\r\n\r\n* the importlib_resources exclusions were only used for Python\r\n  < 3.9 and we are now >= 3.0 so we can remove it\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

task that defers and then launches a trigger:\r\n```\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.providers.standard.sensors.date_time import DateTimeSensorAsync\r\nfrom airflow.utils import timezone\r\nimport datetime\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"demo_deferred\",\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n) as dag:\r\n    DateTimeSensorAsync(\r\n            task_id=\"async\",\r\n            target_time=str(timezone.utcnow() + datetime.timedelta(seconds=3)),\r\n            poke_interval=60,\r\n            timeout=600,\r\n        )\r\n```\r\n\r\nI realised that the \"moment\" inside \"trigger_kwargs\" is of `pendulum.DateTime` type, and since we have a \"dict[str, ANY]`, defined here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/api_fastapi/execution_api/datamodels/taskinstance.py#L82\r\n \r\non its datamodel (we cant really have a `UtcDateTime` for one specific field, like we do [here](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/airflow/api_fastapi/execution_api/datamodels/taskinstance.py#L57C15-L57C26)), it fails to match the type defined in the `Trigger` table which is datetime. \r\n\r\nSo, I have added a \"before\" validator that checks for the type being string and if it is a string, translates it to a datetime object. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line

allows us to refer to an asset without needing the original object, making it easier to schedule against an asset.\r\n\r\nI also added some minor improvements to `register_asset_change` so we can save a db query or the asset-model conversion in some cases.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of possible sytax designs available:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Magic constructor.\r\nAssetRef(name=\"asset-1\")\r\nAssetRef(uri=\"s3://bucket/assets/1\")\r\n\r\n# Magic factory method on Asset.\r\nAsset.ref(name=\"asset-1\")\r\nAsset.ref(uri=\"s3://bucket/assets/1\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nI’m opting for the second one with a factory method since it is easier to implement, but we can discuss which one we like better.","created_at":"2024-12-18T12:03:56Z","updated_at":"2024-12-26T06:59:08Z","closed_at":"2024-12-26T06:59:06Z","merged_at":"2024-12-26T06:59:06Z","merge_commit_sha":"c5d559cf4219102fe8710946d745043e225f083b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ephraimbuddy","id":4122866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMjI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4122866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy","html_url":"https://github.com/ephraimbuddy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ephraimbuddy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"pierrejeambrun","id":14861206,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0ODYxMjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14861206?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun","html_url":"https://github.com/pierrejeambrun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pierrejeambrun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"potiuk","id":595491,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NTQ5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/595491?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk","html_url":"https://github.com/potiuk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/potiuk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"jedcunningham","id":66968678,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2OTY4Njc4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66968678?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham","html_url":"https://github.com/jedcunningham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jedcunningham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"ashb","id":34150,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MTUw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34150?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb","html_url":"https://github.com/ashb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ashb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":

pull request introduces a new helper class for constructing BigQuery Job Detail Links and integrates it into the existing BigQuery operators and links in the Google Cloud provider for Airflow. The most important changes include the addition of the `BigQueryJobDetailLink` class, its integration into the `BigQueryInsertJobOperator`, and the necessary imports and configurations.\r\n\r\nNew feature addition:\r\n\r\n* Added `BIGQUERY_JOB_DETAIL_LINK` constant to construct URLs for BigQuery Job Detail Links in `airflow/providers/google/cloud/links/bigquery.py`.\r\n* Created `BigQueryJobDetailLink` class to handle the construction and persistence of BigQuery Job Detail Links in `airflow/providers/google/cloud/links/bigquery.py`.\r\n\r\nIntegration into existing operators:\r\n\r\n* Imported `BigQueryJobDetailLink` in `airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py` to make it available for use in BigQuery operators.\r\n* Updated `operator_extra_links` in `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` to include `BigQueryJobDetailLink` in `airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py`.\r\n* Added logic to persist BigQuery Job Detail Links in the `execute` method of `BigQueryInsertJobOperator` in `airflow/providers/google/cloud/operators/bigquery.py`.\r\n\r\nConfiguration update:\r\n\r\n* Added `BigQueryJobDetailLink` to the `extra-links` section in `airflow/providers/google/provider.yaml` to ensure it is recognized as an extra link.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

PLEASE READ DESCRIPTION\r\n\r\nContext: In the context of multi team airflow, teams will have their own configuration files for the components that run on team-only hosts (for workers, dag parsers, etc running on those hosts). However some team components must live along side one another on the scheduler host, namely executors, and some airflow configuration affecting teams must also be accessible to the scheduler.\r\n\r\nThis commit delivers the capability for airflow `conf` to load and allow access to multiple team configurations in addition to the main/global configuration we have today.\r\n\r\nA new config is added `core.multi_team_configurations` (the name is not set in stone) in which teams and their associated configuration files are specified. E.g.:\r\n```\r\npath/to/team_a/config:team_a,different/path/team_b/configuration:team_b\r\n```\r\n\r\nAirflow conf, during initialization, loads each of these configurations and makes them accessible by id, e.g.: `conf.get(\"core\", \"executor\", team_id=\"team_a\")`\r\n\r\nWithin those team configurations, teams can specify the executors they would like to use and the associated configuration for those executors. Since each team configuration is loaded and stored separately, this allows multiple instances of the same executor to be configured.\r\n\r\nThe Base executor has been updated with a config shim to allow easier access to team based executor configations and the AWS ECS executor has been updated to use it as a proof of concept. Other executors will need to be updated to be \"multi team compliant\" at a later time to minimize the size and scope of this commit.\r\n\r\n#### NOTE: There was an initial proposal to move to TOML format for Airflow config and store all configuration (both team and gloabl) in one file. This is still a possibility in the future, but the approach in this commit was decided for the following reasons:\r\n1. It leverages the same configuration format as Airflow always had, so there is less barrier to entry and migration for users\r\n2. It is a simpler implementation, which simplifies the overall process of releasing an initial version of multi-team airflow\r\n3. Separate files for teams is actually a nice mechanism for management of the overall cluster. Teams can update their own files as they see fit and they only need to be synced onto the scheduler host for pickup, rather than the configuration changes needing to be made to a shared file which no team should be able to view (otherwise they would see the configuration from other teams).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

#44882 and #44847.\r\n\r\nToday there is an option to extend the Flask Rest API in the auth manager interface. That allows, for instance, the FAB auth manager to extend the Rest API and define users, roles and permissions related APIs.\r\n\r\nIn Airflow 3, we are moving away from Flask and use FastApi as engine for APIs. As such, the auth manager interface should have an option to extend this API using FastAPI (instead of Flask).\r\n\r\nIn FAB auth manager, instead of converting all the APIs defined with Flask to FastAPI, we use `WSGIMiddleware` to embed a minimal Flask application that host the APIs.\r\n\r\nWith this PR: `GET http://localhost:29091/auth/auth/fab/v1/roles` return the list of roles. The duplicate `auth/auth` in the API path will be removed when the legacy Airflow 2 is gone.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

database engines are limited to 32-bit integer values. As some users reported errors in\nweight rolled-over to negative values, we decided to cap the value to the 32-bit integer. Even\nif internally in python smaller or larger values to 64 bit are supported, <code>priority_weight</code> is\ncapped and only storing values from -2147483648 to 2147483647.</p>\n<p>Bug

from the config, the home directory is now expanded from <code>~</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/696\">#696</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In get_credential, now returns None when the indicated username is not found. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/698\">#698</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v25.4.1</h1>\n<h2>Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed ValueError for AnonymousCredentials in CLI. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/694\">#694</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v25.4.0</h1>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Refined type spec and interfaces on credential objects. Introduced AnonymousCredential to model a secret without a username. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/689\">#689</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v25.3.0</h1>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Deprecated support for empty usernames. Now all backends will reject an empty string as input for the 'username' field when setting a password. Later this deprecation will become a more visible user warning and even later an error. If this warning is triggered in your environment, please consider using a static value (even 'username') or comment in the issue and describe the use-case that demands support for empty usernames. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jaraco/keyring/issues/668\">#668</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>v25.2.1</h1>\n<h2>Bugfixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix typo in CLI creds mode.

this back in v2-10-test -- removed it while force-pushing due to other conflicts. Original PR: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44968)\r\n\r\nThis was initially added in response to https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/168. However, we now have `ti.log_url` that is used for that; example usages:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/dcd41f60f1c9b5583b49bfb49b6d85c640a2892c/airflow/models/taskinstance.py#L1362\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/dcd41f60f1c9b5583b49bfb49b6d85c640a2892c/providers/src/airflow/providers/smtp/notifications/templates/email.html#L28\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/dcd41f60f1c9b5583b49bfb49b6d85c640a2892c/docs/apache-airflow/howto/email-config.rst?plain=1#L76\r\n\r\nSo, to simplify what we need to pass from API server to the Task SDK in preparation for Airflow 3, I want to simplify and remove things that aren't needed. In this case, this is good so we don't pass/expore secrets unnecesarily via `conf`. This is removed in Airflow 3 and deprecated in 2.10.x/2.11\r\n\r\nMailing list Thread: https://lists.apache.org/thread/2n0l8y2oyq4442p0lsnmbbcl6rmbj3k7\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

As `pagination.pageSize` is undefined `offset` which is `pagination.pageIndex * pagination.pageSize` becomes NaN and passed to the API causing backend to return 422 if the API call for a resource is made before `config` finishes. Once config finishes the offset value is calculated properly and then passed to API resulting in two API calls with 1 invalid returning 422 and then again passing with valid offset value to fetch the correct response. Use `enabled` option to not make call if the `offset` is `NaN`. Another option would be default value for `pagination.pageSize` but that would result in 2 API calls with default value and later the value from `config` API call.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is that for running dagruns and running/deferred task instances the `end_date` is not present causing `NaN` to be displayed in UI in dagrun duration, task instance duration, etc. Use current time if end_date is not present like the legacy UI.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce : \r\n\r\n1.

introduction of AIP-72 and removal of AIP-44 in main broke the EdgeExecutor/EdgeWorker on main.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes it working again as the second executor supporting AIP-72 for the first \"edge cases\" and check.\r\n\r\nNote: Two commits, first one is an extension in the Executor API which is needed to ship a session context to EdgeExecutor not to break DB lock during scheduling as EdgeExecutor need to write to DB. Let me know if I should separate into two PRs... (as of dev rules core and provider changes bundled here)\r\n\r\n@ashb Would very much favor a review from you here if the design anticipated for AIP-72 is correctly understood how integrated.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test with Airflow 3, use:\r\n`breeze start-airflow --python 3.12 --load-example-dags --backend postgres --executor EdgeExecutor --answer y`\r\n\r\nIn Airflow 3 the \"example_bash_operator\" is working, not all other DAGs.\r\n\r\nIf somebody wants to test Airflow 2.10 as regression, this can be made via:\r\n`breeze down && rm dist/* && breeze release-management prepare-provider-packages --include-not-ready-providers edge && breeze start-airflow --python 3.12 --load-example-dags --backend postgres --executor EdgeExecutor --answer y --use-airflow-version

I have a dag which times out in 1 second but the task sleeps for 100 seconds, it will end up throwing the `AirflowTaskTimeout` exception:\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom time import sleep\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.providers.standard.operators.python import PythonOperator\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.sdk.definitions.baseoperator import AirflowException\r\n\r\n\r\ndef print_hello():\r\n    sleep(100)\r\n\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"hello_world_single_task\",\r\n    default_args={\r\n        \"owner\": \"airflow\",\r\n        \"depends_on_past\": False,\r\n        \"retries\": 1,\r\n    },\r\n    description=\"A simple Hello World DAG with one task\",\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1),\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    tags=[\"example\"],\r\n) as dag:\r\n    hello_task = PythonOperator(\r\n        retries=1,\r\n        task_id=\"say_hello\",\r\n        execution_timeout=timedelta(seconds=1),\r\n        python_callable=print_hello,\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nShould be marked with `up_for_retry`\r\n<img width=\"1722\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8de40ddb-0bfb-4faa-a02e-5a6567570e15\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A task raises the `AirflowException` \r\nExample: If we are unable to render the pod template for K8s while using K8sExecutor with Airflow.\r\n```\r\n@provide_session\r\ndef get_rendered_k8s_spec(task_instance: TaskInstance, session=NEW_SESSION) -> dict | None:\r\n    \"\"\"Fetch rendered template fields from DB.\"\"\"\r\n    from airflow.models.renderedtifields import RenderedTaskInstanceFields\r\n\r\n    rendered_k8s_spec = RenderedTaskInstanceFields.get_k8s_pod_yaml(task_instance, session=session)\r\n    if not rendered_k8s_spec:\r\n        try:\r\n            rendered_k8s_spec = render_k8s_pod_yaml(task_instance)\r\n        except (TemplateAssertionError, UndefinedError) as e:\r\n            raise AirflowException(f\"Unable to render a k8s spec for this taskinstance: {e}\") from e\r\n    return rendered_k8s_spec\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n1. This PR adds the `up_for_retry` state into `TerminalTIState` as it is a terminal state and on hitting this state, anything additional work apart from marking it to that state needn't be done.\r\n2. Called the API from task runner when AirflowTaskTimeout, AirflowException is raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

So there is no scenario when one of these exceptions are thrown due to this: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/83da311e4ce5a7965b2e1c412941a8f26ad8225e/task_sdk/src/airflow/sdk/execution_time/supervisor.py#L608-L615\r\n\r\nWe check with the database for the state with the heartbeat and if ever there is a different state, other than running: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/83da311e4ce5a7965b2e1c412941a8f26ad8225e/airflow/api_fastapi/execution_api/routes/task_instances.py#L210-L218, we fail with a 409.\r\n\r\nBut, if this state is ever hit, we should just mark the TI as failed. There are UTs https://github.com/apache/airflow/compare/main...astronomer:airflow:AIP72-taskterminated-or-afexception?expand=1#diff-413c3c59636a3c7b41b8bb822827d18a959778d0b6331532e0db175c829dbfd2R342-R397 which

remote logging with Elasticsearch, currently only reading log is supported. Users need to deploy other softwares (such as filebeat & logstash) to ship Airflow task logs to Elasticsearch. Also, user would need to ensure the log messages contain a valid log_id of format {dag_id}-{task_id}-{execution_date}-{try_number} in order for reading remote log to work.\r\n\r\nThis PR will enable the ElasticSearchTaskHandler to automatically write each task log to Elasticsearch after each DAG task is completed. 2 more config are introduced (namely: `write_to_es` and `target_index`, which are set to False and `airflow-logs` by default`) \r\n\r\nThe ElasticSearchTaskHandler will now also consider the config `delete_local_logs` in `logging` session. When both `write_to_es` and `delete_local_logs` are set to True, the handler will delete local task logs upon successfully writing logs to ES.\r\n\r\nrelated: #42780

part of Airflow 3 DAG definition files will have to use the Task SDK for\nall their classes, and anything involving running user code will need to be\nde-coupled from the database in the user-code process.\n\nThis change moves all of the \"serialization\" change up to the\nDagFileProcessorManager, using the new function introduced in #44898 and the\n\"subprocess\" machinery introduced in #44874.\n\n**Important Note**: this change does not remove the ability for dag processes\nto access the DB for Variables etc. That will come in a future change.\n\nSome key parts of this change:\n\n- It builds upon the WatchedSubprocess from the TaskSDK. Right now this puts a\n  nasty/unwanted depenednecy between the Dag Parsing code upon the TaskSDK.\n  This will be addressed before release (we have talked about introducing a\n  new \"apache-airflow-base-executor\" dist where this subprocess+supervisor\n  could live, as the \"execution_time\" folder in the Task SDK is more a feature\n  of the executor, not of the TaskSDK itself)\n- A number of classes that we need to send between processes have been\n  converted to Pydantic for ease of serialization.\n- In order to not have to serialize everything in the subprocess and deserialize everything\n  in the parent Manager process, we have created a `LazyDeserializedDAG` class\n  that provides lazy access to much of the properties needed to create update\n  the DAG related DB objects, without needing to fully deserialize the entire\n  DAG structure.\n- Classes switched to attrs based for less boilerplate in constructors.\n- Internal timers convert to `time.monotonic` where possible, and `time.time`\n  where not, we only need second diff between two points, not datetime objects\n- With the earlier removal of \"sync mode\" for SQLite in #44839 the need for\n  separate TERMIANTE and END messages over the control socket can go\n\nCo-authored-by: Jed Cunningham <66968678+jedcunningham@users.noreply.github.com>\nCo-authored-by: Daniel Imberman <daniel.imberman@gmail.com>\n\n<!--\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\n or more contributor license agreements.

In this case, this is good so we don't pass/expore secrets unnecesarily via `conf`.

asset events to dashboard to display the top 6 events sorted by default newest first (latest) asset events. The source links to the task instance the created the event. The selected time from filter is applied to the API to get only events in last 12 hours, past week etc. The triggered dagruns links to the dagruns triggered due to the asset event.\r\n\r\nNotes to reviewer and self\r\n\r\n1. The UI prototype had small circle to denote the task instance and dagrun status but this might cause more API calls.\r\n2. The first dagrun is linked with the prototype a link to \"+n more\" where n are the remaining dagruns. But currently there is no asset page to link to for better information and how do we display the same.\r\n3. When there is `from_rest_api` it's usually from API and source is displayed as API. Similar can be done for asset events from trigger. Opened #44944 for discussion.\r\n4. The UI prototype displays `asset.uri` for the card. Do we need to display `asset.name` or `asset.uri` ?\r\n5.

If `databricks_task_key` is not provided, a default value is generated using the hash of the `dag_id` and `task_id`.\r\n\r\nKey Changes:\r\n* Users can now define databricks_task_key explicitly.\r\n* When not provided, the key defaults to a deterministic hash based on dag_id and task_id.\r\n\r\nFixes: #41816\r\nFixes: #44250\r\nrelated: #43106\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description

(almost) and failed state is part of the terminal state.\r\n\r\nThis PR extends the task runner's run function to handle cases when we have to fail a task: `AirflowFailException, AirflowSensorTimeout`. It is functionally very similar to #44786\r\n\r\nAs part of failing a task, multiple other things also needs to be done like:\r\n- Callbacks: which will eventually be converted to teardown tasks\r\n- Retries: Handled in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44351\r\n- unmapping TIs: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44351\r\n- Handling task history: will be handled by https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44952\r\n- Handling downstream tasks and non teardown tasks: will be handled by https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44951\r\n\r\n### Testing performed\r\n#### End to End with Postman\r\n\r\n1.
