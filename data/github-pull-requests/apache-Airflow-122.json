PR fixed the case where we have a faulty state in the database. The state that is fixed is that both the unmapped task instance and mapped task instances exist at the same time.\r\n\r\nSo we have instances with map_index [-1, 0, 1].\r\nThe -1 task instances should be removed in this case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

selected tis are finished, instead of needing to wait for all tis of that upstream task, effectively enabling depth-first execution.\r\n\r\nMost of the \"relevant map indexes\" logic is already in

for all handlers except alibaba.\r\n\r\nDifferent handlers may be implemented in slightly different ways depending on their characteristics.\r\n\r\nBlob storage handlers work by writing to file and then uploading when task is complete.  For these handlers, each trigger writes to its own file and at trigger end the file is uploaded with a suffix that distinguishes it from the task log file.\r\n\r\nBlob storage handlers include the following:\r\n* GCS\r\n* S3\r\n* WASB\r\n* Alibaba (not implemented due to missing functionality in hook)\r\n\r\nFor file-based handlers, we have to do two things to make this work with triggers.\r\n\r\nThe first is, we don't emit to them synchronously.  We pipe the messages through a queue to a QueueListener that runs in a thread and emits them to the potentially-blocking handler.  \r\n\r\nThe second is, we need to create a distinct instance of the task handler for each trigger because each instance corresponds to a specific file (and each trigger needs to write to a distinct file).  To accomplish this we add a wrapper handler that manages the individual handlers and routes the messages accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe other category of handlers is a type of \"streaming\" handler, where messages are pushed through an API to a remote logging service more or less as they are emitted.  This category includes the following handlers:\r\n* Cloudwatch\r\n* Elasticsearch\r\n* Stackdriver\r\n\r\nEach of the streaming handlers has slightly different characteristics.\r\n\r\nStackdriver essentially has fully native support for triggers.  It doesn't require wrapping or routing messages through queuelistener.  This is because for one it already runs in a thread and routes messages through a queue internally so as not to be blocking. Additionally it already attached the necessary labels to the record in each call of `emit` so updathing it to generate those based on the task instance attached to the LogRecord was a trivial matter.\r\n\r\nCloudwatch _could_ be made \"native\" like stackdriver but the underlying library (watchtower, a 3rd party community library) doesn't quite have the necessary behavior. So for now it still requires using the wrapper and queuelistener.\r\n\r\nElasticsearch is a bit of a hybrid.  By default it is filebased and assumes you have a something like filebeat to ship the files.  In  that way it behaves the same as  blob storage handlers. But it has an optional config where messages go to stdout.  It it is possible that it could be modifed such that when run in stdout mode it could be \"native\" like stackdriver where there's just one instance of the handler but such work is not taken on here.\r\n\r\nTry it with sample dag:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith DAG(\r\n    dag_id=\"example_time_delta_sensor_async\",\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    start_date=pendulum.datetime(2021, 1, 1, tz=\"UTC\"),\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    tags=[\"example\"],\r\n):\r\n    wait = TimeDeltaSensorAsync(task_id=\"wait\",

is possible to fully deserialize XCom values in the webserver by specifying a `deserialize` parameter. This creates a potential security issue as deserialization instantiates arbitrary objects.\r\n\r\nCustom XCom backends should implement `orm_deserialize_value` themselves if they want to retain the behavior. However, it is strongly suggested to deserialize on the client side for the above mentioned reasons.\r\n\r\nSee also: #26343\r\n\r\ncc @uranusjr @ashb @herunyu \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

this limited pod length to 63 but that's the limit for label values not pod ids.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a UUID was previously used which occupies 32 characters, much more space than necessary.  This left you with a short and not very readable pod name.\r\n\r\nHere we update the logic to use a suffix of 8 random alphanum chars, and set a longer max length of 80 characters.\r\n\r\nOne qualification on that.  We set a max length of 80 when _we_ control the pod name -- e.g. when using kube executor or KPO when pod name not supplied.  Since we're generating it, 80 is a reasonable max.  But, with KPO, when pod_id, and user asks for random suffix, we set max length to 253, to give user most control.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, we consolidate the name building logic into one function.  Previously, one function would create the \"pod_id\" and then, only later in the process would a random suffix be added.  Here, all of that is done in create_pod_id, and its behavior is controllable with params.  cc @o-nikolas \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy 80 characters: that's about as much as can reasonably fit on a normal-sized terminal.  Any more doesn't help with readability.\r\n\r\nWhy 8 character suffix: 8 random characters is more than enough. Probably fewer would be fine too.\r\n\r\nFinally, a note.... I copied the core code to provider and we must keep it there until min airflow version catches up.  And instead of duplicating test code, i parameterized the core test to also handle provider.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, an example.\r\n\r\nCalling with \r\n\r\n```\r\nPodGenerator.make_unique_pod_id(\"this-is-my-semi-long-but-not-too-long-pod-id\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would previously get

#26200 and #26460\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I add a new config `wait_for_past_depends_before_skipping` which is `False` by default. When it is `True`, and `depends_on_past` is `True`, then when it is decided to skip a task because of trigger rules, the task will stay in `None` state waiting the past dependencies to be met.\r\nIn this case, we can ensure that the task instance will be scheduled only when **all** the past instances are finished with one of the states `succeeded` or `skipped`.","created_at":"2022-11-16T12:56:41Z","updated_at":"2024-10-24T03:25:39Z","closed_at":"2023-01-03T09:10:58Z","merged_at":"2023-01-03T09:10:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"25e0e30099e13a3cb7d3d7ffd16989dc48ade3e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2172800071,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTcyODAwMDcx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/type:new-feature","name":"type:new-feature","color":"5AF3AB","default":false,"description":"Changelog:

feature enables to use _impersonation_chain_ in kwargs in env variables setting Google secret manager backend.\r\nExample of the use of new feature:\r\n ```\r\nAIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND=airflow.providers.google.cloud.secrets.secret_manager.CloudSecretManagerBackend\r\nAIRFLOW__SECRETS__BACKEND_KWARGS='{\"impersonation_chain\":\"service_account@project_id.iam.gserviceaccount.com\",\"project_id\":\"project_id\",\"connections_prefix\": \"airflow-connections\", \"variables_prefix\": \"airflow-variables\"}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy this change is needed? \r\nOur Airflow deployment service account and team developers accounts share one main team serviceaccount via serviceAccountTokenCreator permission. This team serviceaccount has accesses to particular services like BQ, GCS, Google secrets. While BQ and GCS operators has impersonalisation_chain arg, google secret manager backend doesnt support this feautre. Using this new feature all approaches are aligned and it is possible to follow this good pattern.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

part of resolving https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/25627, we needed better visibility into scheduler query performance, and patched this metric into our deployment of 2.2.5. This metric measures the duration of the critical section query that pulls scheduled tasks instances. Given the complexity of that query, and the size of the `task_instance` table when running Airflow at scale, it can be a significant performance bottleneck.\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

optimizations here:\r\n\r\n1. If the provided `map_indexes` value is a `range` object with `step=1`, we can optimize the query to use `>=` and `<` instead of `IN`.\r\n2. Instead of eagerly pulling values from database and sort in Python, we can use `CASE` to make the database perform the sorting instead.\r\n3. If `map_indexes` is a range, the above sorting can be further optimized into a simple column ordering and take advantage of the index.\r\n\r\nI’m pretty sure the first and third are harmless.
