Description\r\nThis PR adds the ability to configure the `maxSubqueryBytes` parameter with a the following configurations:\r\n1. `unlimited`: Same as unbounded, and defers to the original behavior. \r\n2. `auto` : Instead of manually setting the maxSubqueryBytes, the user can set it to apportion a fixed memory of the heap (which is calculated automatically) for materializing the results of the subqueries for incoming queries. This should cover most of the cases and allow the user to experiment with the new feature with minimum friction. \r\n3. Some specific numerical value: (Was present originally) - Reserve the provided portion of bytes per query for materializing the subquery results. This can be used for fine-tuning if the query patterns are known. For example, if the operator knows that the cluster has only a couple of concurrent subqueries, then they can configure it to a larger value than set by `auto`. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nA new monitor `SubqueryCountStatsMonitor` which emits the metrics corresponding to the subqueries and their execution is now introduced. Moreover, the user can now also use the `auto` mode to automatically set the number of bytes available per query for the inlining of its subquery's results. \r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SubqueryLimitUtils`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#14796.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis PR is major change is lookup container loading and dropping behavior and avoid the lookup inconsistencies in update container call. It also introduces the user defined SLA of loading the lookups, loading and dropping behavior will avail this SLA and wait for new container to load. \r\n\r\nLoad Container call: \r\nStarts the new container, if cache is loaded then drop the old container if exists and start serving from new container.   \r\nIf cache is not loaded then wait for container to come up with startRetries times and then declare the new container as failed and kill new container, still continue serving from old container.\r\n\r\nDrop Container call: \r\nWe get drop call from 2 flow,  Update and Delete call from lookups. Drop Notice also accepts the optional loadedContainer. \r\nLoadedContainer is only passed in update flow. We make sure that loadedContainer is loaded with cache before dropping the existing container. If cache is not loaded, wait for given SLA for loadedContainer to load. \r\nIf cache is loaded in loadedContainer then go ahead and drop it. \r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [x] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

main motivation behind this PR is to fix a bug I noticed with large task payloads (>~1MB). Since we compress the task.json and then store it in an environment variable (TASK_JSON), we are limited by the max environment variable size of the (usually linux) OS we are running the peon on, which is normally 128 KB (https://askubuntu.com/questions/1385551/how-long-can-display-environment-variable-value-be#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20the%20maximum,131%2C072%20single%2Dbyte%20ASCII%20characters.)\r\n\r\nThis issue can be replicated by trying to create a task with a payload that gzip compresses to >128KB. You'll get a \"Argument list too long\" when starting the container.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI think the best way to get around this problem is to introduce a flag into the internal peon command that lets you choose to have the peon pull the task payload from the overlord during startup, rather than expecting it to be provided via environment variable.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this solution is that the KubernetesTaskRunner currently relies on a toTask(Job) interface on each of the taskAdapters to restore tasks from k8s. When the runner is restarted, it lists the running jobs in the cluster and then uses the TASK_JSON environment variable to reconstruct the task.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think we actually need to do this, because for a task to be restored properly it needs to also be available in TaskStorage. If a job is restored from K8s in the KubernetesTaskRunner, but it's not available in taskStorage, then you get errors like below.\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: org.apache.druid.java.util.common.ISE: Unable to grant lock to inactive Task [index_parallel_wikipedia_lngdjhog_2023-08-10T14:00:12.586Z]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd eventually TaskQueue sends a request to the KubernetesTaskRunner to shut the task down.\r\n```\r\n2023-08-10T14:01:12,443 INFO [TaskQueue-Manager] org.apache.druid.k8s.overlord.KubernetesTaskRunner - Shutdown [index_parallel_wikipedia_lngdjhog_2023-08-10T14:00:12.586Z] because [Task is not in knownTaskIds]\r\n```\r\nThis is reproducible by deploying the overlord with HeapMemoryTaskStorage (instead of storing tasks in a metadataDB) creating a long running task (like a kafka ingest or bigger batch ingest), then restarting the overlord. The KubernetesTaskRunner will restore the task but it will get killed by TaskQueue since the task will not be in TaskStorage.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I updated the restore() method to check each Job (by taskId) in TaskStorage before restoring it. This has the side effect of letting us deprecate toTask(Job) on the TaskAdapter, so we can add the feature to have the peons pull the task.json from the overlord instead of providing it via environment variable.\r\n\r\nWill have a second PR that actually adds the flag to get the peon to pull the task.json instead of passing it via TASK_JSON soon.\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Update KubernetesTaskRunner.restore() to check with TaskStorage before restoring a task.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * KubernetesTaskRunner\r\n * K8sTaskAdapter/PodTemplateTaskAdapter\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #14359\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

Description\r\n`cachingCost` has been deprecated in #14484 and is not advised to be used in production clusters as it may cause usage skew across historicals which the coordinator is unable to rectify. This PR completely disables `cachingCost` strategy as it has now been rendered redundant due to recent performance improvements made to `cost` strategy.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Disable `cachingCost` strategy\r\n- Add `DisabledCachingCostBalancerStrategyFactory` for the time being so that we can give a proper error message before falling back to `CostBalancerStrategy`. This will be removed in subsequent releases.\r\n- Retain `CachingCostBalancerStrategy` and related classes for testing and benchmarking purposes.\r\n- Add javadocs to `DiskCostBalancerStrategy`.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n`cachingCost` balancer strategy is now disabled and cannot be used in a Druid cluster. Using `cachingCost` falls back to `cost` balancer strategy.","created_at":"2023-08-11T06:38:27Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:49:48Z","closed_at":"2023-08-16T06:13:52Z","merged_at":"2023-08-16T06:13:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"d9221e46e4b30dde80724dc49355a3ba5abcb312","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":297508895,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyOTc1MDg4OTU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Release%20Notes","name":"Release

Javascript tiered broker selector strategy and Javascript filter for Java 17\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nJavascript tiered broker selector strategy and Javascript filter broke when running Druid on Java 17.\r\nJavascript tiered broker selector strategy and Javascript filter depend on Nashorn JavaScript Engine (`final ScriptEngine engine = new ScriptEngineManager().getEngineByName(\"javascript\");`). The Nashorn JavaScript Engine has been removed from Java. [Deprecated in Java 11](https://openjdk.org/jeps/335), [removed in Java 15](https://openjdk.org/jeps/372). (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71481562/use-javascript-scripting-engine-in-java-17)\r\n\r\nSome options I found:\r\n- We can use different script engine, as [GraalVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraalVM). (https://stackoverflow.com/a/71481633/4942837)\r\n- We can add back the Nashorn JavaScript Engine as a dependency and continue to use it (https://github.com/openjdk/nashorn) See: https://github.com/szegedi/nashorn/wiki/Using-Nashorn-with-different-Java-versions\r\n\r\nI chose the second option which is to add back the Nashorn JavaScript Engine as a dependency and continue to use it. Since Nashorn was the deprecated javascript engine that used to come with Java 8, I think it should be same/similar to what we had before (compare to using a new script engine like GraalVM). **However, https://github.com/szegedi/nashorn/wiki/Using-Nashorn-with-different-Java-versions suggests that the standalone is not compatible with Java 8-10 and is only compatible with Java 11 and later** \r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-10T06:51:29Z","updated_at":"2024-12-20T15:46:49Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c5fa28b7848bc6f2bd430ef12a1fdbdb96a53cd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1252153393,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUyMTUzMzkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1433958072,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDMzOTU4MDcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Dependencies","name":"Area

satisfies #14154.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI think #14142 was the only real roadblock to making SQL compatible mode be the default mode, so with that merged, I think it is finally time. I think this should be merged as a pair in the same release that adds #14734, so we do the behavior changes all at once, but the end result will be a much more well behaved Druid SQL queries out of the box.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nSQL compatible null handling mode is now enabled by default in Druid 28.0.0! This setting, `druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull`, is now set to `false` by default in the code, so if not explicitly configured in runtime.properties, upon upgrade clusters will take on new behavior with how Druid handles null values during ingestion and query processing. If you wish to retain the existing behavior, you must explicitly configure this to `true`. Any segments written in the new default mode can still be read correctly in the classic mode, at query time the null values will be ignored or coerced to zeros as appropriate.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-09T20:45:14Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:48:45Z","closed_at":"2023-08-22T03:07:13Z","merged_at":"2023-08-22T03:07:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"5d1412949e4f8ff99c54021da82f34ec842891e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\nInvalidNullByteFault for MSQ displayed the query column name (the one that is used internally while planning and executing the query) instead of the output column name (the one that is given by the user). Sometimes the two are similar, however, for columns involving expressions, it is not the case.\r\nIt can be misleading for someone who is not familiar with this quirk, and even then it would require reading the native plan to figure out the culprit column.\r\n\r\nThis PR maps the query column to the output column name while surfacing the fault since that is readily visible to the user while executing the query.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nFor a query like:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nWITH \"ext\" AS (SELECT *\r\nFROM TABLE(\r\n  EXTERN(\r\n    '{\"type\":\"inline\",\"data\":\"{\\\"desc\\\":\\\"Normal row\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"Hi I am a normal row\\\"}\\n{\\\"desc\\\":\\\"Row with NULL\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"There is a null in\\\\^@ here somewhere\\\"}\\n{\\\"desc\\\":\\\"Anther normal row\\\",\\\"text\\\":\\\"Nice\\\"}\\n\"}',\r\n    '{\"type\":\"json\"}'\r\n  )\r\n) EXTEND (\"desc\" VARCHAR, \"text\" VARCHAR))\r\nSELECT\r\n  \"desc\",\r\n  REPLACE(\"text\", 'a', 'A') AS \"text\"\r\nFROM \"ext\"\r\n```\r\nOriginal Behaviour:\r\n\r\n```InvalidNullByte: Invalid null byte at source [external input source: InlineInputSource{data='{\"desc\":\"Normal row\",\"text\":\"Hi I am a normal row\"} {\"desc\":\"Row with NULL\",\"text\":\"There is a null in\\^@ here somewhere\"} {\"desc\":\"Anther normal row\",\"text\":\"Nice\"} '}], rowNumber [2], column[v0], value[There is A null in here somewhere], position[18].

PR adds a new API: `/druid/indexer/v1/supervisor/<supervisorId>/resetOffsets`. This API accepts a reset datasource metadata in the body and only resets the specified partition offsets in the metadata store. Unlike the `/reset` API, this new API retains any previously checkpointed partition offsets not specified in the payload, so tasks will resume from where they left off. Further, only tasks serving the reset partitions will be restarted.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR. Remove this section if there is no corresponding issue.

The web-console (and possibly other clients) already send an empty body payload to the `reset` API, so accepting a new body in the existing API will cause some clients to break.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe API flow is as follows: \r\n- User submits the reset datasource metadata to the supervisor's `/resetOffsets` endpoint\r\n- Few validations like the stream and metadata type are done before a `ResetOffsetsNotice` is created\r\n- When the notice is handled asynchronously, the reset offsets is done, writing offsets to the metadata store and then restarting the appropriate tasks as necessary\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

Description\r\nReport one new metrics to monitor K8s task runner:\r\n- `k8s/peon/startup/time`: to report the time for peon pod takes to startup\r\n\r\nAnd implement the two existing metrics: `taskSlot/used/count` and `taskSlot/idle/count`\r\n\r\nAlong with the previous https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14698 change, we can answer the following questions about K8s task runner status:\r\n- how many tasks/peons are running in K8s now? Use `taskSlot/used/count`.\r\n- How long K8s takes to start peon job? Use `k8s/peon/startup/time`\r\n- How long the pod actually run to finish? Use `task/run/time`\r\n- How long task is pending before running in K8s? Use `task/pending/time`\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

Description\r\n\r\nPreviously, the `KillUnusedSegments` coordinator duty, in charge of periodically deleting unused segments, could spawn an unlimited number of kill tasks for unused segments. This change adds 2 new coordinator dynamic configs that can be used to control the limit of tasks spawned by this coordinator duty\r\n\r\n`killTaskSlotRatio`: Ratio of total available task slots, including autoscaling if applicable that will be allowed for kill tasks. This limit only applies for kill tasks that are spawned automatically by the coordinator's auto kill duty. Default is 1, which allows all available tasks to be used, which is the existing behavior\r\n\r\n`maxKillTaskSlots`: Maximum number of tasks that will be allowed for kill tasks. This limit only applies for kill tasks that are spawned automatically by the coordinator's auto kill duty. Default is INT.MAX, which essentially allows for unbounded number of tasks, which is the existing behavior. \r\n\r\nRealize that we can effectively get away with just the one `killTaskSlotRatio`, but following similarly to the compaction config, which has similar properties; I thought it was good to have some control of the upper limit regardless of ratio provided.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNEW: `killTaskSlotRatio`  and `maxKillTaskSlots` coordinator dynamic config properties added that allow control of task resource usage spawned by `KillUnusedSegments` coordinator task (auto kill)\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Motivation\r\n\r\n### Design\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Create class `DataSegmentChangeResponse` to replace `SegmentLoadDropHandler.DataSegmentChangeRequestAndStatus`. The payload structure is still the same and the APIs are fully backward compatible.\r\n- Add class `SegmentChangeStatus` to replace `SegmentLoadDropHandler.Status`\r\n- Move `BackgroundSegmentAnnouncer` into a separate class but with no other changes\r\n- Add method `DataSegmentChangeRequest.getSegment` for ease of use\r\n- Add method `DataSegmentAnnouncer.isAnnounced` to short-circuit duplicate load/drop requests\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid

pod name to the TaskLocation object for Kubernetes task scheduling to make debugging easier.\r\n### Description\r\nSince the task id <-> kubernetse pod name mapping is not direct and hard to figure out, its helpful for debugging to show the pod name in the druid console. I think it makes sense to add this to task location since the pod the task is running on is sort of like the location when running tasks in K8s.\r\n\r\nI also added a log message on the overlord when the task location is set because this is useful for forensics (taskLocation is cleared when the task finishes)\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug ...\r\n#### Renamed the class ...\r\n#### Added a forbidden-apis entry ...\r\nI thought about just putting the pod name into the task object itself, but i liked the idea of having it in taskLocation in case we ever have some concept of retrying tasks on pods (which would result in a task running as a different pod name)\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n- Surface kubernetes pod name in the K8sTaskRunner to improve visibility and forensics.\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n* TaskLocation\r\n* KubernetesPeonLifecycle\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what the task location looks like in the druid console now.\r\n<img width=\"1405\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-08-04 at 10 54 24 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/druid/assets/17736581/3c5a01dc-78eb-496a-a797-894fe8b31788\">\r\n\r\nIf the field is null (e.g. when not running the k8s task runner) nothing will show up under k8sPodName.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nAdd a new metric that is emitted by the compaction task that shows how much time it spent fetching and analyzing segments. When a datasource is very fragmented, this could be a large amount of time. This metric will be helpful to operators as they can monitor this to see if they would benefit from explicitly specifying the schema in the auto compaction / manual compaction config if their use case allows it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a sample of what the metric would look like\r\n```\r\n{\"taskIngestionMode\":\"REPLACE_LEGACY\",\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"taskType\":\"compact\",\"metric\":\"compact/segmentAnalyzer/fetchAndProcessMillis\",\"service\":\"druid/middleManager\",\"groupId\":\"coordinator-issued_compact_wikipedia_cgmonfmg_2023-08-04T00:35:38.106Z\",\"host\":\"localhost:8100\",\"version\":\"28.0.0-SNAPSHOT\",\"value\":78,\"dataSource\":\"wikipedia\",\"taskId\":\"coordinator-issued_compact_wikipedia_cgmonfmg_2023-08-04T00:35:38.106Z\",\"timestamp\":\"2023-08-04T00:35:40.605Z\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nNEW: `compact/segmentAnalyzer/fetchAndProcessMillis` is now reported by compaction tasks to indicate how much time was spent fetching and processing segments to infer the schema\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nUpdates the example config to log all events emitted via the LoggingEmitter to a new events log file.\r\n\r\nThis will make it easier for devs who are testing locally to look at the events being emitted from the local deployment of Druid. Since all the events are in a separate file it makes it easy to upload these events into Druid if devs want to do some quick slice and dice of the events.\r\n\r\nThe only thing worth noting is that event if emitting is configured to be noop, an empty events.log file is found in the logs folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nEnable the ServiceStatusMonitor introduced in #14443 to the list of monitors enabled in the example configurations.\r\n\r\nThis monitor seems like a good candidate to be enabled by

However, I did not see an obvious pattern in the code to enable the monitor in all services by default. So I decided to follow the pattern of enabling the monitor in the common runtime properties instead.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\"

Description\r\n\r\nThis patch builds on top of #14443  to report some additional dimensions along with the heartbeat metric for the peons and middle managers.\r\n\r\nThe peons now report the task id, group id, datasource and task type. This will be useful as operators can use these dimensions to see how much of their cluster capacity is being used by different types, datasources, group, etc.\r\n\r\nThe middle managers will now report the worker version, category and whether it is enabled or not.\r\n#### Release note\r\nImproved: The service/heartbeat metric now has additional dimensions to provide more insight into ingestion on the cluster.\r\n\r\nThe metric on the middle manager looks like\r\n```\r\n{\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"metric\":\"service/heartbeat\",\"workerCapacity\":2,\"workerEnabled\":1,\"service\":\"druid/middleManager\",\"workerVersion\":\"0\",\"host\":\"localhost:8091\",\"version\":\"28.0.0-SNAPSHOT\",\"value\":1,\"timestamp\":\"2023-08-03T01:57:34.335Z\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe metric on the peon looks like\r\n```\r\n{\"feed\":\"metrics\",\"taskType\":\"index_parallel\",\"metric\":\"service/heartbeat\",\"service\":\"druid/middleManager\",\"groupId\":\"index_parallel_wikipedia_hibldimn_2023-08-03T02:00:01.754Z\",\"host\":\"localhost:8100\",\"version\":\"28.0.0-SNAPSHOT\",\"value\":1,\"dataSource\":\"wikipedia\",\"taskId\":\"index_parallel_wikipedia_hibldimn_2023-08-03T02:00:01.754Z\",\"timestamp\":\"2023-08-03T02:00:07.146Z\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nFor certain tasks, `RemoteTaskActionClient` can return a response whose total size exceeds the max value of `int`. Inside `BytesFullResponseHolder`, the `getContent` method finds the total size of an array of `byte[]` using an `int`, which causes it to overflow.

It also detects a wraparound so large that it becomes positive again. In that case, the ByteBuffer would be allocated, but it would be too small to fit all the data.

Description\r\nPart of #14154, this PR sets 'strict booleans' to be on by default, which homogenizes Druid boolean handling to consistently use `LONG` types internally and behave in a more SQL compliant manner, particularly with how nulls are handled in correct tri-state logic. This config was introduced in #11184.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n`druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans` is now enabled by default in the code in Druid 28. If this setting is not explicitly configured in runtime.properties, upon upgrade clusters will take on new behavior with how Druid handles boolean types during ingestion and query processing, consistently using `LONG` types internally for any boolean values which are ingested and as the output of boolean functions for ingestion transformations and query time operations.\r\n\r\nPrevious behavior:\r\n* `100 && 11` -> `11` \r\n* `0.7 || 0.3` -> `0.7`\r\n* `100 && 0` -> `0`\r\n* `'troo' && 'true'` -> `'troo'`\r\n* `'troo' || 'true'` -> `'true'`\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\n* `100 && 11` -> `1`\r\n* `0.7 || 0.3` -> `1`\r\n* `100 && 0` -> `0`\r\n* `'troo' && 'true'` -> `0`\r\n* `'troo' || 'true'` -> `1`\r\n\r\nLogical operators will also behave in an SQL compliant manner, treating nulls as 'unknown' instead of false.\r\n\r\nFor the \"or\" operator:\r\n* `true || null`, `null || true` -> `1`\r\n* `false || null`, `null || false`, `null || null`-> `null`\r\n\r\nFor the \"and\" operator:\r\n* `true && null`, `null && true`, `null && null` -> `null`\r\n* `false && null`, `null && false` -> `0`\r\n\r\nTo revert to the default behavior present in Druid 27 and older, `druid.expressions.useStrictBooleans` may be set to `false` in the runtime.properties of cluster configuration.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-08-02T07:32:57Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:48:40Z","closed_at":"2023-08-22T07:19:56Z","merged_at":"2023-08-22T07:19:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"194a9c9abc1b6edf98c2652687515200c6cbd3e8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Description\r\nFixes a case I missed in #14688 when the return type is STRING but its coming from a top level array typed column instead of a nested array column while making a vector object selector. \r\n\r\nAlso while here I noticed that the internal `JSON_VALUE` functions for array types were named inconsistently with the non-array functions, so I renamed them. These are not documented so it should not be disruptive in any way, since they are only used internally for rewrites while planning to make the correctly virtual column.\r\n * `JSON_VALUE_RETURNING_ARRAY_VARCHAR` -> `JSON_VALUE_ARRAY_VARCHAR`\r\n * `JSON_VALUE_RETURNING_ARRAY_BIGINT` -> `JSON_VALUE_ARRAY_BIGINT`\r\n * `JSON_VALUE_RETURNING_ARRAY_DOUBLE` -> `JSON_VALUE_ARRAY_DOUBLE`\r\n\r\nThe internal non-array functions are `JSON_VALUE_VARCHAR`, `JSON_VALUE_BIGINT`, and `JSON_VALUE_DOUBLE`.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been

Description\r\n\r\nBuilding on previous work (#14659), this PR introduces the ability to add additional labels to Prometheus metrics, providing more flexibility for data management and identification. This change is particularly useful when managing various types of data across multiple Druid clusters.\r\n\r\nThe additional labels can be set using a new optional configuration parameter (`druid.emitter.prometheus.extraLabels`) added to the Prometheus emitter.\r\n\r\n### Changes Made\r\n\r\n- Added a new configuration parameter (`druid.emitter.prometheus.extraLabels`) to the Prometheus emitter.\r\n- Modified the PrometheusEmitter to include the extra labels as Prometheus labels if the configuration parameter is set.\r\n- Modified the unit tests to include and test this new functionality.\r\n\r\n### Release note\r\n\r\nThe Prometheus emitter now supports a new optional configuration parameter, `druid.emitter.prometheus.extraLabels`. This addition offers users the flexibility to add arbitrary extra labels to their Prometheus metrics, providing more granular control in managing and identifying data across multiple Druid clusters or other dimensions.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nKey changed/added classes in this PR:\r\n\r\n- PrometheusEmitter\r\n- PrometheusEmitterConfig\r\n- PrometheusEmitterTest\r\n- PrometheusEmitterConfigTest\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Motivation\r\n\r\nBatch segment allocation is often difficult to debug due to the actual error messages being hidden in the logs.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n- Update signature of method `IndexerMetadataStorageCoordinator.allocatePendingSegments` to return `List<SegmentAllocateResult>` instead of just the allocated `SegmentIdWithShardSpec`\r\n- Propagate the encountered error all the way back to the `SegmentAllocationQueue` where it is logged when abandoning a request.\r\n- Simplify the logs and error messages\r\n- Reduce log level and remove logs where information is not useful for debugging\r\n- Rename some methods for clarity\r\n- No functional change\r\n\r\n### Old logs in case of a conflicting segment\r\n```java\r\n2023-08-01T14:09:15,209 INFO [main]

Description\r\nFixes a bug that can occur with `ExprEval.bestEffortOf` (used by 'auto' column indexers and the web-console sampler) whenever dealing with ARRAY types that have a lot of variation in their content. The problem was the `castTo` for primitive types implementation for `ARRAY` types was only handling casting to primitive arrays. This meant that an input array with types mixed such as `[\"string\", [{\"some\":\"object'}]]` would fail because it would try to cast `STRING` to `ARRAY<COMPLEX<json>>` which was unhandled. The fix is to delegate casting to arbitrary array types by casting the value first to the array element type, and wrapping that in an `Object[]` and making an `ArrayExprEval` the same way we do for other array casts. The added tests cover this case (and a couple other cases).\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2023-07-31T19:05:22Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T10:51:55Z","closed_at":"2023-08-01T16:25:14Z","merged_at":"2023-08-01T16:25:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e456d25ae38e0dbaa073f2f196c7fcb1d478340","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

a change back in 2014, the topN query has been computing all PostAggregators on all intermediate responses from leaf nodes to brokers.

This change rewrites the query that is pushed down to only have the minimal set of PostAggregators such that it is impossible for downstream processing to do too much work.
