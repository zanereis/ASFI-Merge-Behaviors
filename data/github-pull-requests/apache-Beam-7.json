adds standalone SchemaTransform Providers for the specific implementations of JDBC (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQL Server).\r\n\r\nThis was already simulated in the Beam YAML framework, but by implementing concrete providers, other SDKs can take advantage of the pre-packaged drivers (Python and Go SDKs). This also allows for specific doc generation specific to an implementation.\r\n\r\nMore detailed docs were also added.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/32687 I updated the vLLM model handler to use an asyncio event loop. This led to huge efficiency gains (around <batch_size>x faster), but also broke it in environments where there is already an asyncio event loop because of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55409641/asyncio-run-cannot-be-called-from-a-running-event-loop-when-using-jupyter-no\r\n\r\nThis is generally fine (this is not a normal environment to run Beam), but it does break things for colab environments. It can be easily fixed with this tweak, though - this PR makes that tweak to our example so that this keeps working. I've confirmed we don't need this to run in Dataflow/other runners\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

href=\"http://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning</a>.</h1>\n<h2>(0.41.0) UNRELEASED</h2>\n<h3>Added</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>New <code>DISABLE_SPLIT_LIST_WITH_COMMENT</code> flag.\n<code>DISABLE_SPLIT_LIST_WITH_COMMENT</code> is a new knob that changes the\nbehavior of splitting a list when a comment is present inside the list.</p>\n<p>Before, we split a list containing a comment just like we split a list\ncontaining a trailing comma: Each element goes on its own line (unless\n<code>DISABLE_ENDING_COMMA_HEURISTIC</code> is true).</p>\n<p>This new flag allows you to control the behavior of a list with a comment\n<em>separately</em> from the behavior when the list contains a trailing comma.</p>\n<p>This mirrors the behavior of clang-format, and is useful for e.g. forming\n&quot;logical groups&quot; of elements in a list.</p>\n<p>Without this flag:</p>\n<pre><code>[\n  a,\n  b,  #\n  c\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>With this flag:</p>\n<pre><code>[\n  a, b,  #\n  c\n]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Before we had one flag that controlled two behaviors.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>DISABLE_ENDING_COMMA_HEURISTIC=false</code> (default):\n<ul>\n<li>Split a list that has a trailing comma.</li>\n<li>Split a list that contains a comment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><code>DISABLE_ENDING_COMMA_HEURISTIC=true</code>:\n<ul>\n<li>Don't split on trailing comma.</li>\n<li>Don't split on comment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now we have two flags.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Yaml's error handling framework returns per-record errors as a schema'd PCollection with associated error metadata (e.g. error messages, tracebacks). Currently there is no way to \"unnest\" the nested rececords (except for field by field) back to the top level if one wants to re-process these records (or otherwise ignore the metadata).  Even if there was a way to do this \"up-one-level\" unnesting it's not clear that this would be obvious to users to find.  Worse, various forms of error handling are not consistent in what the \"bad records\" schema is, or even where the original record is found (though we do have a caveat in the docs that this is still not set in stone).\r\n\r\nThis adds a simple, easy to identify transform that abstracts all of these complexities away for the basic usecase.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`AverageRecordSize` instance may be written to by a single thread at any given time (in `@ProcessElement`), but may be read by other threads (e.g. `@GetSize`) during an ongoing write. Depending on the target architecture, this may result in reading a torn value, a stale value and/or a different state of either `avgRecordSize` or `avgRecordGap`. A barrier (`synchronized` in this case) around loads and stores of the two averages avoids this potential data race.\n\n------------------------\n\nThank you for your contribution!

is clearer how it interacts with ForkJoinPool execution as there are not separate completion stages.\r\n\r\nI was unable to reproduce observed stuckness in pipeline where runAsync scheduled tasks appear not to have completed on forkjoinpool and the pool workers appears idle. I am wondering if this could be a possible cause because with the existing code, the futures on the fork join pool are not being directly joined and thus perhaps not explicilty tied to the async work. This may affect if the tasks not being pushed into execution.  The common pool used is not in asyncMode and ForkJoinExecutor indicates it is safer for non-joining use if asyncMode is set.\r\n\r\nFix #29926\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

fix of #32696\r\n\r\nWe already vendored and repackaged antlr runtime into the jar. It was intended to avoid dependency version conflict if user using different antlr versions. However, beam java core still declares it as a dependency.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\njava core pom has antlr4-runtime dependency, e.g. in https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/beam/beam-sdks-java-core/2.60.0/beam-sdks-java-core-2.60.0.pom\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n<groupId>org.antlr</groupId>\r\n<artifactId>antlr4-runtime</artifactId>\r\n<version>4.7</version>\r\n<scope>compile</scope>\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n\r\nran `./gradlew :sdks:java:core:publishToMavenLocal -Ppublishing` and checked that antlr-runtime is no longer a dependency of beam java core in generated pom.\r\n\r\nAlso checked the jar still repackaged antlr runtime in `org/apache/beam/repackaged/core/org/antlr/v4/runtime`\r\n\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR fixes a few tests in the YAML examples catalog, including enabling the Spanner tests which were previously excluded.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of organizational changes including separating error_handling into a separate file. This was to allow LogForTesting to use the error_handling framework which is handy for examples tests that replace WriteTo transforms with LogForTesting ad-hoc that consume an error output of an upstream WriteTo transform.\r\n\r\nThis is also a prereq to #32289\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

#32531\r\n\r\n# Improve GCS file handling in DataflowRunner\r\n\r\nThe proposed changes are only limited to DataflowRunner and are kept simple. When a GCS file is detected in `filesToStage`, we first download this to a local temp file and replace the GCS file with this local temp file.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added functionality to handle GCS files in `replaceGcsFilesWithLocalFiles()` method\r\n- Files with GCS paths (gs://) are now downloaded to local temp files before being staged\r\n- Maintains original file names when downloading from GCS\r\n- Handles both files with and without staging names specified\r\n- Adds logging for file downloads and replacements\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n- Temp files are created with same names as original GCS files for consistency\r\n- Files are downloaded using FileSystems API for proper GCS integration\r\n- Original functionality for local files is preserved unchanged\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n- Add a simple IT to validate the file is downloaded and staged later with a Dataflow job\r\n<img width=\"491\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/535d14b1-8902-4531-953c-af1426925251\">\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
