Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14238](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14238) - Add CaptureBoxEvents processor\r\n\r\nThis pull request adds a new processor that will consume all Box events and output the content of the events as an array of JSON records. In addition to this processor, the pull request also adds another controller service to connect to the Box API using the developer token option. This option is used only for testing as this token expires after 60 minutes but it allows testing the Box components in NiFi without the need for a Business/Enterprise account.\r\n\r\n#

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14228](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14228) Removes the historical fallback Sensitive Properties Key from the `set-sensitive-properties-key` and `set-sensitive-properties-algorithm` commands, throwing an exception when it is not configured in `nifi.properties`.\r\n\r\nThis reflects the previous approach implemented for NiFi 1, before automatic key generation was implemented. NiFi 2 removed support for a blank Sensitive Properties Key, so these commands do not need to have the fallback value implemented.\r\n\r\nChanges include updating unit tests to expect failures for a blank key.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14219](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14219) Enables Expression Language evaluation for the `Jolt Specification` property in `JoltTransformJSON` when reading the specification as Resource.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation supports Expression Language, but assumes that the presence of an expression means that the property value contains the specification. Following the adjustment in this pull request, the conditional is removed, allowing framework processing of the property value as a Resource, which could reference a file path or contain the specification. This change preserves existing behavior and also enables specification file paths to support expressions, as shown in updated unit tests.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14156](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14156) Improves the application bootstrap process when running on Microsoft Windows using the Java [Attach API](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/jdk.attach/com/sun/tools/attach/package-summary.html) to find the application process for status and shutdown. These changes resolve issues with the `nifi.cmd stop` and `nifi.cmd status` commands not working.\r\n\r\nThe restructured bootstrap process for NiFi 2 uses the [ProcessHandle](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/ProcessHandle.html) interface added in Java 9. The OpenJDK implementation for Linux and macOS provides command arguments for the associated process, but the implementation in Windows does not provide command arguments as of Java 21. [JDK-8176725](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8176725) describes the lack of support on Windows.\r\n\r\nTo maintain the stateless behavior of the application bootstrap process on Windows, changes in this pull request introduce new process handle discovery classes based on the Attach API and the [VirtualMachine](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/jdk.attach/com/sun/tools/attach/VirtualMachine.html) class. The `VirtualMachine.getSystemProperties()` method returns the system properties containing the information required to identify the bootstrap and application processes. This approach is implemented using feature detection when `ProcessHandle.Info.arguments()` is empty, preserving existing behavior on Linux and macOS.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include correcting the `nifi.cmd` to avoid passing the application properties argument to the bootstrap process, and adjusting the `start` command behavior to launch the application in a new minimized window. The adjusted start behavior then returns to the command prompt, enabling subsequent commands such as `status` or `stop` as needed.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14209](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14209) Restructures application HTTP `Host` header validation, removing the `HostHeaderHandler` and adding the `HostPortValidatorCustomizer` in the framework Jetty Server.\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of the [SecureRequestCustomizer](https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/blob/413a15d6d9baddcb7d4d83e245ebcc1a0eeacfa1/jetty-core/jetty-server/src/main/java/org/eclipse/jetty/server/SecureRequestCustomizer.java#L62) in Jetty 12 requires TLS [Server Name Indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) checking, which enforces that the requested `Host` header or authority must match one of the DNS Subject Alternative Names on the server certificate. When the HTTP request does not include a valid matching DNS name in the `Host` header, the `SecureRequestCustomizer` returns an HTTP 400 Bad Request with `Invalid SNI` as the reason. The check disallows the use of IP addresses and enforces DNS names matching the configured server certificate, which obviates much of the validation logic previously implemented in the `HostHeaderHandler`.\r\n\r\nThe TLS SNI check does not validate the requested port, which is an optional part of the `Host` header. Changes in this pull request introduce the `HostPortValidatorCustomizer` with a configurable property for valid ports based on the existing `nifi.web.proxy.host` property. The new class checks the requested port for secure HTTPS requests and returns an HTTP 421 Misdirected Request status for invalid port numbers.\r\n\r\nNew test methods for the Jetty `StandardServerProvider` confirm the expected behavior of both TLS SNI checking and host port validation with requests containing custom `Host` headers.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include streamlining construction of the `RequestUriBuilder` using only the `HttpServletRequest`, which contains the list of allowed context paths for request.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following

noteworthy</h3>\n<h4>🚀 New: Java 24 Support</h4>\n<p>This release of PMD brings support for Java 24. There are no new standard language features,\nbut a couple of preview language features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/488\">JEP 488: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Second Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/492\">JEP 492: Flexible Constructor Bodies (Third Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/494\">JEP 494: Module Import Declarations (Second Preview)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://openjdk.org/jeps/495\">JEP 495: Simple Source Files and Instance Main Methods (Fourth Preview)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these preview language features,\nyou'll need to enable it via the environment variable <code>PMD_JAVA_OPTS</code> and select the new language\nversion <code>24-preview</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview\npmd check --use-version java-24-preview ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note: Support for Java 22 preview language features have been removed.

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14185](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14185)\r\nMigrated to Nx latest (20). This also upgraded to Angular 19. This PR is everything required for those changes to be complete.\r\n\r\nIn angular 19, the default component type is standalone. So if you do not declare it `standalone: false`, it will be true. This change had ramifications including needing to upgrade some 3rd party components to make them compatible as well as relaxing an eslint rule from error to warn when declaring a component as `standalone: false`.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of new compiler errors that showed up as a result of the upgrade too. These were solved in this PR as well.\r\n\r\nOne particular change to mention, the mat-expand-panel had some behavior changes that made scrolling the contents of the documentation panel on load not work properly. You will see in this PR that we now initialize state of the desired expanded panel based on the current route and control its expanded state through properties on the class rather than assume the `openAll` method on the accordion will complete in time before the attempt to scroll happens.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14189](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14189) Upgrades Bouncy Castle dependencies from 1.79 to [1.80](https://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bouncy-castle-java/?filter=java%3Drelease-1-80).\r\n\r\nChanges in Bouncy Castle algorithm resolution required updating the unit test to use the Bouncy Castle implementation of the encryption method instead of the JCE implementation.\r\n\r\nUpdates to `DecryptContentPGP` included replacing deprecated usage of `getKeyID()` with `getKeyIdentifier().getKeyId()` and introducing a try-catch block around `PGPUtil.getSymmetricCipherName()`. The `getSymmetricAlgorithm()` method can return an invalid value when the passphrase is incorrect, so catching the exception and throwing a `PGPDecryptionException` handles this scenario.\r\n\r\n#

includes a debug level message indicating when a request is starting:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRequest [591f5d4c-fa18-45e9-bccc-7885ab5fb73a] GET http://localhost:59793/ starting\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe debug level message can be used to determine when the Processor issues an HTTP request that may or may not succeed due to network communication issues.\r\n\r\nThe new approach also includes an informational level message indicating the same request identifier information as well as the HTTP response status code and protocol version received.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRequest [591f5d4c-fa18-45e9-bccc-7885ab5fb73a] GET http://localhost:59793/ HTTP 200 [http/1.1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the default log level of Processors set to `WARN` neither of these log messages will be visible under the standard configuration, avoiding unnecessary log messages. With the introduction of the informational level log, basic tracking and troubleshooting can be enabled as needed.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14165](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14165) Corrects application server handling of unknown HTTP requests when NiFi is configured to run behind a proxy server with an alternate context path.\r\n\r\nThe updated implementation passes the list of allowed context paths configured from `nifi.web.proxy.context.path` in `nifi.properties` to a new Jetty redirect rule implementation. When the HTTP request includes a proxy context path header with a value from the allowed list of paths, the redirect rule prefixes the location with the context path. This correction ensures that requests for invalid or unknown URLs will be redirected to the standard user interface path when NiFi is running behind a proxy server.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14068](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14068) Corrects the behavior of SFTP processors when configured for proxy access using a DNS name.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of the SSHJ `SSHClient` always attempts to resolve DNS names to IP addresses when constructing an `InetSocketAddress` for the socket connection. This behavior is not ideal when connecting through a proxy server because NiFi may not be able to resolve the DNS address and should rely on the proxy server to perform DNS resolution.\r\n\r\nThe revised implementation introduces an extension of `SSHClient` that overrides the `makeInetSocketAddress` method to return an unresolved address when the client is configured with a Proxy Socket Factory. The unresolved status instructs HTTP and SOCKS proxy socket clients to send a DNS address instead of a resolved IP address.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14155](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14155) Improves handling of the Jackson `ObjectMapper` in the `TokenParserFactory` interface and associated implementations. Improvements include refactoring the interface definition to remove configuration variables so that `ObjectMapper` and `JsonFactory` instances can be reused.\r\n\r\nThe refactored approach applies to JSON and YAML Record Readers as well as the Record Transform Proxy for Python Record Processors. The revised implementation creates instances of `ObjectMapper` with configured Stream Read Constraints on Controller Service enabling. With thread safety provided in [JsonFactory](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-core/latest/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonFactory.html) and [ObjectMapper](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-databind/latest/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/ObjectMapper.html), reusing these objects improves performance for repeated processing operations.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior to pull request creation.\r\n\r\n### Issue Tracking\r\n\r\n- [X] [Apache NiFi

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14129](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14129) Adds a `DatabaseDialectService` Controller Service interface in a new `nifi-database-dialect-service-api` as a migration path the existing internal `DatabaseAdapter` interface and associated implementations.\r\n\r\nThe new `nifi-database-dialect-service-nar` includes a `StandardDatabaseDialectService` implementation that provides a generic implementation for the minimum Statement Types of ALTER, CREATE, and SELECT.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the `DatabaseDialectService` applies to the following Processors:\r\n\r\n- PutDatabaseRecord\r\n- GenerateTableFetch\r\n- QueryDatabaseTable\r\n- QueryDatabaseTableRecord\r\n- UpdateDatabaseTable\r\n\r\nThe service also applies to the `DatabaseParameterProvider`.\r\n\r\nThis pull request provides an interim transitional strategy for moving away from the `DatabaseAdapter` to the new `DatabaseDialectService`. The initial set of changes preserve existing `Database Type` properties that use `DatabaseAdapter` implementations and wraps interacts with the `DatabaseAdapter` in a new `DatabaseAdapterDatabaseDialectService`.\r\n\r\nExisting `Database Type` properties include a new value named `Database Dialect Service` that enables the dependent `Database Dialect Service` property for Controller Service implementations.\r\n\r\nThis wrapping approach avoids the need to convert existing `DatabaseAdapter` implementations as part of this change, allowing existing Processor configurations to work without changes, while also support incremental migration of `DatabaseAdapter` implementations to new `DatabaseDialectService` implementations.\r\n\r\nThe `DatabaseDialectService` interface has a simplified contract method named `getStatement()` which takes a `StatementRequest` and returns a `StatementResponse` containing rendered SQL. The `StatementRequest` interface has standard implementations, and a `QueryStatementRequest` extended interface for describing queries. The `getSupportedStatementTypes()` provides a concise method for implementations to indicate supported statements.\r\n\r\nChanges include modifications to existing unit tests that involved direct access to Processor methods using the `DatabaseAdapter`. Existing unit and integration tests against public methods and behaviors remain in place to validate implementation changes.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior

an issue in the QueryCassandra processor where attributes from the incoming FlowFile were occasionally lost in subsequent FlowFiles when the processor split the results due to a configured Fetch Size (e.g., 750). This fix ensures that all FlowFiles maintain the original attributes, even when multiple FlowFiles are generated from a single query result.\r\n\r\nThe NIFI JIRA:

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14137](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14137) Adds a `code-compliance` GitHub workflow that includes the Static Analysis job moved from the `ci-workflow` and adds `Generate SBOM` and `Scan SBOM` steps based on the Anchore [sbom-action](https://github.com/anchore/sbom-action) and [scan-action](https://github.com/anchore/scan-action) integrating Syft and Grype.\r\n\r\nThe generated SBOM will be added as at artifact to the GitHub workflow run, making it easy to download and view. The Grype scan works off of the generated SBOM and provides visibility into vulnerable dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe initial workflow is limited to the NiFi assembly binary for SBOM and vulnerability scanning.\r\n\r\nThe workflow configuration is set to run on all pull requests and pushes, and on a scheduled basis for regular updates to potential vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nMoving the analysis job out of the `ci-workflow` helps clarify failure points related to code validation and scanning versus compile or test failures.\r\n\r\n# Tracking\r\n\r\nPlease complete the following tracking steps prior

Summary\r\n\r\n[NIFI-14134](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NIFI-14134) - add support for JSON file upload to CLI pg-import\r\n\r\nCurrently, in the CLI,\r\n\r\n````bash\r\n./cli.sh nifi pg-import\r\n````\r\n\r\nonly supports creating a process group based on references to a versioned flow through a Registry Client.\r\n\r\nIn, the UI, it is possible to drag and drop a process group onto the canvas and provide a JSON file definition to create a new process group based on the flow definition. This approach should also be supported by the CLI command `pg-import`.\r\n\r\nWith this change, it is now possible to execute a command like below:\r\n\r\n````bash\r\n$ ./bin/cli.sh nifi pg-import -i /my/flow.json -p nifi-cli.properties\r\n42357e56-0194-1000-7b1f-ba830cac1de6\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd it returns the UUID of the process group created with the uploaded JSON flow definition.\r\n\r\n#
