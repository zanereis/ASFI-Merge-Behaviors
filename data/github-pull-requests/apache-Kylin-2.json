Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1. Add a new property `kylin.query.pushdown-concurrent-running-threshold=10` to control the concurrency of the queries pushed down, 10 running queries by default, which will be bond to a Semaphore instance in JVM scope.\r\n\r\n2. The pushed down query will calling `Semaphore` instance's `tryAcquire(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` to acquire the chance to run, so the waiting queries could be interrupted if failed in `330s` by default.\r\n\r\n## Why these changes?\r\n1. `QueryLimiter` won't working then the server is not in `downgrade` state, which means no limitations on the number of queries pushed down to run, therefore we need another strategy to accomplish the goal.\r\n2. During retrieving the file status, it gives us a chance to react to the interruption, so as to terminate the planning queries.\r\n\r\n## Branch to commit\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin3** for v2.x to v3.x\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin4** for v4.x\r\n- [x] Branch **kylin5** for v5.x\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [x] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [x] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n1.初始发现：线上告警某节点存在大量的CLOSE_WAIT，通过 netstat -anp 发现来自于Kylin4 JobServer 进程，CLOSE_WAIT数达到9000多。并且 CLOSE_WAIT 来自的外部地址端口都是 50010，而该端口是 Hadoop DataNode 数据传输使用，故此怀疑是 JobServer在每次作业构建时 fileSystem.open() 一个流后没有进行close。\r\n2.模拟复现：在研测环境提交cube构建任务，并观察 CLOSE_WAIT 数及增长情况，发现每次cube构建结束后，CLOSE_WAIT 数增加1，至此可以确定是JobServer代码中未关闭流导致。\r\n3.定位代码：深入kylin4 构建代码进行debug，最终定位到 org.apache.kylin.engine.spark.utils.UpdateMetadataUtil#syncLocalMetadataToRemote 94行 （Apache Kylin main分支）\r\n\r\nString resKey = toUpdateSeg.getStatisticsResourcePath();\r\nString statisticsDir = config.getJobTmpDir(currentInstanceCopy.getProject()) + \"/\"\r\n+ nsparkExecutable.getParam(MetadataConstants.P_JOB_ID) + \"/\" + ResourceStore.CUBE_STATISTICS_ROOT + \"/\"\r\n+ cubeId + \"/\" + segmentId + \"/\";\r\nPath statisticsFile = new Path(statisticsDir, BatchConstants.CFG_STATISTICS_CUBOID_ESTIMATION_FILENAME);\r\nFileSystem fs = HadoopUtil.getWorkingFileSystem();\r\nif (fs.exists(statisticsFile)) {\r\nFSDataInputStream is = fs.open(statisticsFile); //未关闭流\r\nResourceStore.getStore(config).putBigResource(resKey, is, System.currentTimeMillis());\r\n}\r\n\r\nCubeUpdate update = new CubeUpdate(currentInstanceCopy);\r\nupdate.setCuboids(distCube.getCuboids());\r\nList<CubeSegment> toRemoveSegs = Lists.newArrayList();\r\n4. 研测验证：\r\nPath statisticsFile = new Path(statisticsDir, BatchConstants.CFG_STATISTICS_CUBOID_ESTIMATION_FILENAME);\r\nFileSystem fs = HadoopUtil.getWorkingFileSystem();\r\nif (fs.exists(statisticsFile)) {\r\ntry (FSDataInputStream is = fs.open(statisticsFile)) { // 关闭流\r\nResourceStore.getStore(config).putBigResource(resKey, is, System.currentTimeMillis());\r\n}\r\n}\r\n修改代码后，在研测环境进行多轮cube构建测试，CLOSE_WAIT 均无增加，验证解决。\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49258176/235130020-4929b952-1c5b-4a86-861c-08b38ca284ce.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Branch to commit\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin3** for v2.x to

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n发现kylin4在build job后都会重新new Broadcaster，Broadcaster构造器中会创建一个线程池然后执行任务不停的take广播事件。这个会导致每次构建完job都会创建线程，同时线程也会阻塞在takeFirst处，时间推移服务会不可用。\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49258176/235129598-dbc24825-f31b-4721-9fbb-77c469e4c878.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49258176/235129623-fabbb864-5bb0-4cde-8642-c9885fda25a8.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49258176/235129647-f379ab02-8e33-40aa-bdcd-b8ef1794dbf9.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49258176/235129674-a68b43b8-a58e-4f53-8544-cd005a557b4b.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49258176/235129691-d29c6cf1-96b2-4b01-bdb3-4d2eda30d967.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n##

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUNd8U1u-w8T-qQUReplPhDFkETj3AtFr_Shex501ls/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\n- add config and checker to enable or disable the cube planner1 when build a new segment or refresh a segment. \r\n- add property of `@JsonProperty(\"layout_cost_based_pruned_list\")` which is used to indicate whether the rulebaseindex has been recommended by the cost based algorithm.\r\n- insert a  new stage of `COST_BASED_PLANNER` in `CUBING` job, and the new stage is used to create task to collect the statistics and run the cost based algorithm.\r\n- use the `biginteger` instead of `long` to represent the cuboio\r\n- migrate the algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0 without major changes, and just make some adaptive changes. For example, change the cubeio from `long` to `biginteger`\r\n- migrate the IT/UT for the recommended algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0\r\n\r\n## Branch to commit\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin3** for v2.x to v3.x\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin4** for v4.x\r\n- [x] Branch **kylin5** for v5.x\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wUNd8U1u-w8T-qQUReplPhDFkETj3AtFr_Shex501ls/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\n- add config and checker to enable or disable the cube planner1 when build a new segment or refresh a segment. \r\n- add property of `@JsonProperty(\"layout_cost_based_pruned_list\")` which is used to indicate whether the rulebaseindex has been recommended by the cost based algorithm.\r\n- insert a  new stage of `COST_BASED_PLANNER` in `CUBING` job, and the new stage is used to create task to collect the statistics and run the cost based algorithm.\r\n- use the `biginteger` instead of `long` to represent the cuboio\r\n- migrate the algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0 without major changes, and just make some adaptive changes. For example, change the cubeio from `long` to `biginteger`\r\n- migrate the IT/UT for the recommended algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0\r\n\r\n## Branch to commit\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin3** for v2.x to v3.x\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin4** for v4.x\r\n- [x] Branch **kylin5** for v5.x\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIt is found that the push-down query in kylin4.0.x is very slow for the simple query eg: `select * from table limit 10`. It should respond in seconds, but it often takes a few minutes, and the larger the query data set, the more time-consuming it takes Long, which is very abnormal.BI tools often execute some simple queries to display detailed data. Abnormal query duration often causes BI tools to time out and return error messages, which is very unfriendly to user experience.\r\nThrough investigation, it is found that there is a **shuffle** process in the query plan of this very simple detailed query, which is outrageous.\r\nThe main logic of Kylin executing push-down query is concentrated in `org.apache.kylin.query.pushdown.SparkSqlClient`.Unnecessary Spark DataFrame type transform in `org.apache.kylin.query.pushdown.SparkSqlClient#DFToList` is the main cause of this problem.\r\n\r\n## Branch to commit\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin3** for v2.x to v3.x\r\n- [x] Branch **kylin4** for v4.x\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin5** for v5.x\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [x] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [x] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [x] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why

cube planner1 when build a new segment or refresh a segment. \r\n- add property of `@JsonProperty(\"layout_cost_based_pruned_list\")` which is used to indicate whether the rulebaseindex has been recommended by the cost based algorithm.\r\n- insert a  new stage of `COST_BASED_PLANNER` in `CUBING` job, and the new stage is used to create task to collect the statistics and run the cost based algorithm.\r\n- use the `biginteger` instead of `long` to represent the cuboio\r\n- migrate the algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0 without major changes, and just make some adaptive changes. For example, change the cubeio from `long` to `biginteger`\r\n- migrate the IT/UT for the recommended algorithm from kylin3.1 to kylin5.0\r\n\r\n## Branch to commit\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin3** for v2.x to v3.x\r\n- [ ] Branch **kylin4** for v4.x\r\n- [x] Branch **kylin5** for v5.x\r\n\r\n## Types of changes\r\n\r\nWhat types of changes does your code introduce to Kylin?\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply_\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] Documentation Update (if none of the other choices apply)\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n_Put an `x` in the boxes that apply. You can also fill these out after creating the PR. If you're unsure about any of them, don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help! This is simply a reminder of what we are going to look for before merging your code._\r\n\r\n- [x] I have created an issue on [Kylin's jira](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KYLIN), and have described the bug/feature there in detail\r\n- [ ] Commit messages in my PR start with the related jira ID, like \"KYLIN-0000 Make Kylin project open-source\"\r\n- [ ] Compiling and unit tests pass locally with my changes\r\n- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works\r\n- [ ] I have added necessary documentation (if appropriate)\r\n- [ ] Any dependent changes have been merged\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at user@kylin.apache.org or dev@kylin.apache.org by explaining why
