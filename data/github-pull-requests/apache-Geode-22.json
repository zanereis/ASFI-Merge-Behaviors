UpgradeTestOpenJDK8 has been taking ~59 minutes and its job timeout is 1h.  After adding 1.13.1 as old version, it tipped to taking slightly over an hour.  Timeout for this job is increased to 1h30m as there's no need to cut it so close.\r\n\r\nRecent changes to Benchmarks have also caused longer runs (from 4h -> 7h in the best case, and much much longer in the worst case).  The current job timeout of 8h is being hit frequently, and after trying a temporary increase to 16h, we still saw successful runs taking 15h, and still some timing out, so timeout is increased to 24h for now.  Also added separate timeouts for the other Benchmarks jobs which are more predictable and much shorter.","created_at":"2020-11-25T05:38:31Z","updated_at":"2020-12-01T00:44:54Z","closed_at":"2020-12-01T00:44:50Z","merged_at":"2020-12-01T00:44:50Z","merge_commit_sha":"4a3ac924b6a392ca87f78fa6ee774e348293dc61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5771/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5771/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5771/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/83c83c5bab84a1e637f0ec2825ad98e5b95beceb","head":{"label":"onichols-pivotal:GEODE-8740-increase-test-job-timeouts","ref":"GEODE-8740-increase-test-job-timeouts","sha":"83c83c5bab84a1e637f0ec2825ad98e5b95beceb","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114800905,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4MDA5MDU=","name":"geode","full_name":"onichols-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

`RegionAdvisor.buckets == null` at the time the value of `serials` is generated, an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` may be thrown in `RegionAdvisor.processProfilesQueuedDuringInitialization` if buckets have been initialized at that point.\r\n\r\nCode where `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` might be thrown in `RegionAdvisor.processProfilesQueuedDuringInitialization()`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < buckets.length; i++) {\r\n  BucketAdvisor ba = buckets[i].getBucketAdvisor();\r\n  int serial = qbp.serials[i]; <<< Exception thrown here\r\n  if (serial != ILLEGAL_SERIAL) {\r\n    ba.removeIdWithSerial(qbp.memberId, serial, qbp.destroyed);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nWe ultimately decided that if the buckets were not created at the time the value of `serials` is generated, there is no need to worry about their profiles getting deleted later.  To avoid the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `getBucketSerials()` was modified to return an array of `ILLEGAL_SERIAL` values if the buckets had not been created yet.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

is a second try fixing [GEODE-8652](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-8652).\r\n\r\n- Original PR (now reverted) was: [PR #5666](https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5666)\r\n\r\nWe committed a fix for this ticket a week ago but then found other problems in some applications, so we reverted it today. \r\n\r\nWe've included a brand new concurrency test, `ByteBufferConcurrencyTest` in this latest PR. That new test validates that the newly-discovered concurrency issue is resolved. That test joins a couple tests that were new in the reverted PR: `ConnectionCloseSSLTLSDUnitTest`, and `ByteBufferSharingImplTest`.\r\n\r\nMain product differences in this PR vs the reverted one is that `ByteBufferSharingImpl` has code in `addReference()` to ensure that a reference cannot be added after the sharing object has been \"destructed\". This prevents the reference count from growing (above zero) if it ever reaches zero. That in turn ensures that:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  private int dropReference() {\r\n    final int usages = counter.decrementAndGet();\r\n    if (usages == 0) {\r\n      bufferPool.releaseBuffer(bufferType, buffer);\r\n    }\r\n    return usages;\r\n  } \r\n```\r\n\r\nWill never see `usages == 0` again. So we can never release the buffer again.\r\n\r\nIt also ensures that attempts to call `open()` on this sharing object after a `destruct()` call, will throw an `IOException`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a
