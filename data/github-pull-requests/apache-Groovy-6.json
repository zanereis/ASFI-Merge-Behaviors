Current STC checks for `\"isNotCase\"` and finds nothing so it falls back to `ScriptBytecodeAdapter`'s [implementation](https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/src/main/java/org/codehaus/groovy/runtime/ScriptBytecodeAdapter.java#L714).\r\n\r\nI chose to add `Closure`'s as an extension method rather than a new direct method.  Here is its `isCase`: https://github.com/apache/groovy/blob/master/src/main/java/groovy/lang/Closure.java#L398\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-10239","created_at":"2021-09-17T17:27:27Z","updated_at":"2021-11-24T13:44:23Z","closed_at":"2021-11-24T13:44:18Z","merged_at":"2021-11-24T13:44:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"1cff465ee4eaa159192cbade013033af0b38be04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"paulk-asert","id":280016,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI4MDAxNg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/280016?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert","html_url":"https://github.com/paulk-asert","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paulk-asert/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"daniellansun","id":9151616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkxNTE2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9151616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun","html_url":"https://github.com/daniellansun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/daniellansun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1621/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1621/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1621/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/15cea9905de46df2db05900749e70bdfb1a23542","head":{"label":"apache:GROOVY-10239","ref":"GROOVY-10239","sha":"15cea9905de46df2db05900749e70bdfb1a23542","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34039690,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDAzOTY5MA==","name":"groovy","full_name":"apache/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/groovy","

is a replacement for PR #1591 which was accidentally closed on the occasion of my attempting to move the work into a branch of my fork, rather than master, so I can potentially work on other issues. There is discussion there.\r\n\r\nSummary: It attempts to resolve the question of what happens when a varargs method is invoked with a single argument to the varargs parameter, which is null. When running dynamic code, Groovy has no way to distinguish whether a single null value is a null object reference (and should thus be wrapped in an array for a varargs) or a null array reference (and thus should not). At present it always does the latter, which leads to surprising behaviour when that argument, for example, comes from a method call with a known non-array return type, or even an explicit cast to a non-array type, and would be expected to go into a varargs as an array containing that single null.\r\n\r\nAt compiletime we have this information... at least some of the time. This PR attempts to make use of that information, in the case of the single argument, to examine the expression to determine if it's an array type or not, or dynamic and thus still impossible to resolve. And, when it's confident it's not dynamic nor an array type, to write the array-wrapping into the generated code then, but still leave it as a dynamic method call, so it could still be intercepted by an equivalent replacement of the method known to exist at compiletime.\r\n\r\nWhile the tests pass, it's clearly a worry to be making such a deep change, especially as someone's first Groovy PR! On the other hand this change does make varargs methods in this situation behave consistently between @CompileStatic and @CompileDynamic code. @CompileStatic code is not altered in any way by this PR.\r\n\r\nThat said, there is an argument that @CompileStatic's current behaviour may not be correct anyway - but only really with respect to when the null in question is a null constant. The more useful reason for the change is to try to make it behave better when the null happens to be the value of a typed variable or method return type, or some other kind of expression with a knowable type, including and especially in fact, cast expressions, which may reflect the coder's attempts to assert precisely what should happen here.\r\n\r\nMore problematic, perhaps, is the way this PR breaks the ideal dynamic behaviour of only acting upon what information is available at runtime, and rather opportunistically borrowing information available only at compiletime (but also potentially made incorrect by runtime metaprogramming). There is a question as to whether that *kind* of change is desirable at all. On the other side, the fact remains that the question answered here *cannot* be answered at runtime. A null value retains no clue as to what type of reference it's a null of.\r\n\r\nBut there's a case that such behaviour shouldn't change now, regardless of whether it's right or wrong, for fear it would just break too much. I have every sympathy with that, and personally doubt this will ever get merged now, but the discussion wasn't definitively *over*, so recreating the PR for that sake.\r\n\r\nThe code changes here are identical to the original. In addition the branch has been caught up to the present state of apache/groovy:master. Nothing there appears to clash.","created_at":"2021-06-19T12:09:17Z","updated_at":"2022-08-23T16:18:38Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T16:18:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5ea8187343a926b54524f2e2c4f26d59d3513ff1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1601/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1601/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1601/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/a30d77e64eb9a83e7bbe66dd143a849c05dfbec5","head":{"label":"StrangeNoises:GROOVY-10099","ref":"GROOVY-10099","sha":"a30d77e64eb9a83e7bbe66dd143a849c05dfbec5","user":{"login":"StrangeNoises","id":1295001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTUwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises","html_url":"https://github.com/StrangeNoises","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":369781150,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjk3ODExNTA=","name":"groovy","full_name":"StrangeNoises/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"StrangeNoises","id":1295001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTUwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises","html_url":"https://github.com/StrangeNoises","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/StrangeNoises/groovy","description":"Apache

ambiguous behaviour when varargs methods are called with a single varargs argument, which may evaluate to null. Do it while compiling, when we can (often) tell if a given argument expression will be an array or not, and if clearly not, wrap it in an array. Do nothing for `@CompileStatic`, which already exhibits consistent behaviour; this makes `@CompileDynamic` behaviour consistent with `@CompileStatic` in conditions where the argument type can be known.\r\n\r\nAnd if all else fails (the argument expression is irretrievably dynamic so we couldn't help), the Groovy coder can now force the behaviour they expected with a cast-or-coerce. (It wouldn't have helped before.)\r\n\r\nThe only existing tests that have been changed are those that call a varargs method with a single null constant, as that behaviour is now changed to accept that as a null object, in line with `@CompileStatic` behaviour. Many new test lines have been added to VarargsMethodTest to pick through the various situations that can arise.","created_at":"2021-06-06T16:38:26Z","updated_at":"2021-06-19T11:32:03Z","closed_at":"2021-06-19T10:48:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"014d07dbf0b009ce9b2cedefc39b606ab58e6dd1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1591/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/1591/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/issues/1591/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/groovy/statuses/b3bba1c4190c1ab028c1a9a8fd48399c2788172b","head":{"label":"StrangeNoises:master","ref":"master","sha":"b3bba1c4190c1ab028c1a9a8fd48399c2788172b","user":{"login":"StrangeNoises","id":1295001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTUwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises","html_url":"https://github.com/StrangeNoises","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":369781150,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNjk3ODExNTA=","name":"groovy","full_name":"StrangeNoises/groovy","private":false,"owner":{"login":"StrangeNoises","id":1295001,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTUwMDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1295001?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises","html_url":"https://github.com/StrangeNoises","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StrangeNoises/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/StrangeNoises/groovy","description":"Apache

errors are consistent with ecj, with a separate error message for implementing self or own inner.  Errors are now associated with the extended/implemented type instead of the primary type.  This allows distinct errors in the case of cycle issues with multiple super types.\r\n\r\nEach scenario added in the new test was lacking a cycle error.  There was one example of a type that implemented its own inner interface (GROOVY-8048), but it was not important for the bug.  I think it is safer to bar this kind of thing so we don't run into cycles when navigating outers, supers and

Issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-9649)\r\n\r\nThis Pull request implements the above feature and adds test cases related to left- and full-open ranges.\r\nWe have also added documentation.\r\nThis change *should* be backwards-compatible, as old right-exclusive ranges work as before.\r\nWe have tried to preserve all old constructors and methods so that this change would be as backwards-compatible as possible.\r\n\r\nA few things to note:\r\n\r\n- ranges like `0<..<1` where to and from differ by one, the range is full exclusive and to and from share the same sign (positive numbers and zero are considered to have the same sign) are created as `EmptyRange`s.\r\nThis is because ranges like `0<..<-1` can still be used to index into lists.\r\n- while testing, we noticed that the following equality test produces different results when the operands are switched:\r\n```groovy\r\nIntRange r1 = new IntRange(false, 1, 10) // \"Inclusive-aware\" range\r\nIntRange r2 = new IntRange(1, 10) // Non-inclusive-aware range\r\nr1.equals(r2) // Returns false\r\nr2.equals(r1) // Returns true\r\n```\r\nwe have not changed this behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhile implementing the feature, we noticed some inconsistencies between different ranges, which we have not altered due to backwards compatibility:\r\n- `NumberRange` and `IntRange` contain information about their inclusivity, but `ObjectRange` inclusivity is taken into account when the range is created\r\n- in `IntRange`, the `getFrom` and `getTo` methods return the actual bounds of that range, whereas `NumberRange`'s corresponging methods return the bounds that the object was created with, even if the bounds are not actually included in the range\r\n\r\nThis PR was a joint effort by 4 people:\r\n\r\n@Exploder98 \r\n@iiroki \r\n@OttoVayrynen
