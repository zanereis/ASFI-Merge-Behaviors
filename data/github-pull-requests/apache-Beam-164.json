Implemented `show` API in `interactive_beam` module. The users can\r\ninvoke the API to introspect data through dynamic visualization for\r\ngiven PCollections immediately after they define those PCollections\r\nwithout running pipelines.\r\n2. Added `pipeline_fragment` module to build pipeline fragment including\r\nonly transforms necessary to produce user-desired PCollections and\r\nimplicitly execute the fragment to emit data for user-desired\r\nPCollections.\r\n3. Automagically track and display notebook-cell/ipython-prompt metadata\r\nabout executed code in pipeline graphs. The users now know what pieces\r\nof code are in-effect and can avoid broken in-memory states due to\r\nnotebook cell-re-execution/cell-deletion/hidden-states. Additionally,\r\nAPI `show` always executes the right pipeline fragment no matter how\r\nbroken/messy the in-memory state is for a notebook.\r\n4. Allow duplicated PTransform labels in different cells when the user\r\nconstructs a pipeline bundled with an InteractiveRunner.\r\n5. Made pipeline assertion a common testing module.\r\n6. Created a mock ipython kernel for testing.\r\n7. Updated the example notebook.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

diagrams represent:\r\n- PTransforms and PCollections are both as nodes in directed acyclic graphs.\r\n- PCollections functionally, as inputs and outputs for PTransforms.\r\n- The control flow with edges, rather than objects in the programming model.\r\n\r\nFor source control, the diagrams are SVGs, so you can download the images directly and modify them in graphics

This PR addresses the findings.\r\n\r\nI used gradle-lint-plugin to confirm Ken's findings. See detail in the ticket https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/BEAM/issues/BEAM-8747 .\r\n\r\n- GCP connector turned out using guava in fully-qualified class name ([link](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8747?focusedCommentId=16978573&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-16978573); no action taken.\r\n- sdks/java/extensions/sql/jdbc had \"declared but unused\" Guava dependency.\r\n- runners/google-cloud-dataflow-java/worker depends on 2 classes without declaring. These classes should not depend on Guava class. So I updated them to use vendored Guava.\r\n- sdks/java/io/kinesis has \"used but undeclared\" Guava dependency.\r\n- sdks/java/extensions/sql/zetasql has \"used but undeclared\" Guava dependency.\r\n- sdks/java/io/elasticsearch-tests/elasticsearch-tests-2 has \"declared but unused\" Guava dependency.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

pipeline execution assumes an execution model where Python SDK workers can launch multiple threads that can process the work delegated by the runner. Up to 2.17.0 the model assumed [12 worker threads by default](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/a5118faff0a3de63b9b31a8862aa937b1c6bd8e1/sdks/python/apache_beam/runners/worker/sdk_worker_main.py#L206), possibly customized by pipeline options. As of 2.18.0, we will scale these threads dynamically, see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-8151  \r\n\r\nPart of work execution involves unserializing (unpicking) payloads, such as serialized DoFns. Pickling   depends on a pickler library (`dill`), and Python pickling mechanisms (`pickle` module). As a part of unpickling, python interpreter will dynamically load some modules referenced in users' code.  \r\n\r\nIt appears that concurrent unpickling of data causes races during module imports, which causes deadlocks and/or corrupted imports, see: BEAM-8651. The error is very common on Python 3.x, including latest releases of Python 3.7. \r\n\r\nThis PR guards picking operations with a lock to mitigate these errors in Beam. \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests

FlinkUberJarJobServer\r\n\r\nPass around options to fix:\r\n\r\n- BEAM-8658: add an `artifact_port` option. We need this because we need to expose a static port to use for artifact staging on Kubernetes (AFAIK gRPC does not support in-process mode on Python).\r\n- BEAM-8781: respect the existing `flink_job_server_jar` option. I wanted this so I could download the released job server jar from Maven instead of having to build it locally. This allows me to override the default behavior for .dev, which is to fail: https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/0b415fd7e9dd5c80034ca237e08c3959ec78ffe3/sdks/python/apache_beam/utils/subprocess_server.py#L176-L181\r\nWe could consider changing that behavior (as indicated in the TODO), but it matters less if you can get around it if you really want to.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR adds support for flat schemas in pubsub topics as discussed in this [mailing list thread](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/bf4c37f21bda194d7f8c40f6e7b9a776262415755cc1658412af3c76@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E). With this change the following SQL query, which filters messages from one pubsub topic and writes the result to another, is possible:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE people (\r\n    event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,\r\n    name VARCHAR,\r\n    age INTEGER\r\n  )\r\n  TYPE 'pubsub'\r\n  LOCATION 'projects/my-project/topics/my-topic'\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE eligible_voters ...\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO eligible_voters (\r\n  SELECT\r\n    name\r\n    FROM people\r\n    WHERE age >= 18\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe change maintains support for the original `event_timestamp, payload, attributes` style of table definition, but if a definition has a schema that doesn't follow that pattern exactly, the new flattened approach is used.\r\n\r\nA summary of the changes:\r\n- Separated out the AutoValue-based configuration out of `PubsubIOJsonTable` into `PubsubJsonTableProvider.PubsubIOTableConfiguration`. This configuration is now referenced throughout the affected classes.\r\n- Modified `PubsubMessageToRow` so it can read a flat schema.\r\n- Add `RowToPubsubMessage` which (currently) only supports flat schemas. Used in `PubsubIOJsonTable#buildIOWriter`.\r\n\r\nThe changes rely on the `JsonMatcher` added in #10094 \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

now removed the byte[] that was used as the key and exposed the SDKs coder specifically using the structural value for comparison.\r\n\r\nUpdate portable Python to use the iterable state key. Note that this doesn't effect Dataflow since dataflow_runner.py converts all iterable side inputs into multimap right now and no SDK performs key enumeration yet.\r\n\r\nUpdate both Flink and Spark to support iterable API and also key enumeration for multimaps. To minimize the extent of this change, I did the minimal modification for Dataflow. A follow-up PR will do the same for Dataflow and then enable multimap side input key enumeration and iterable lookup within various SDKs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

Replaced the logic of analyzing pipeline with pipeline_instrument\r\nmodule including how PipelineResult subclass works.\r\n3. Replaced the Pipeline Graph rendering logic with pipeline_graph\r\nmodule. Implemented the display_graph interface.\r\n4. The cache manager is now held by a static environment object and\r\nshared with all interactive runners. The environment and its cache\r\nmanager, however, are intialized lazily by any interactive runner in\r\ncurrent main loop/process/thread.\r\n5.

PR is to add support to teardown the DoFns upon the control service termination for Java SDK harness. The detail of discussion can be found here: https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/0c4a4cf83cf2e35c3dfeb9d906e26cd82d3820968ba6f862f91739e4@%3Cdev.beam.apache.org%3E\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n- Cache the informations which could be reused between bundles for the same bundle descriptor. It is a prerequisite to teardown the DoFns upon the control service termination. Besides, it also solves the problem that currently the setup of DoFn is called each time a process bundle request is processed in the Java SDK harness.\r\n- Teardown the DoFns upon the control service termination for Java SDK harness\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master branch)\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLang | SDK |
