This causes redundant pool creation and needs to be fixed. \n\n**Code to Reproduce** :\n\n```\nval conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"spark-fairscheduler\").setMaster(\"local\")\nconf.set(\"spark.scheduler.mode\", \"FAIR\")\nconf.set(\"spark.scheduler.allocation.file\", \"src/main/resources/fairscheduler-duplicate-pools.xml\")\nval sc = new SparkContext(conf)\n```\n\n**fairscheduler-duplicate-pools.xml** :\n\nThe following sample just shows two **default** and **duplicate_pool1** but this also needs to be thought for **N** default and/or other duplicate pools.\n\n```\n<allocations>\n    <pool name=\"default\">\n        <minShare>0</minShare>\n        <weight>1</weight>\n        <schedulingMode>FIFO</schedulingMode>\n    </pool>\n    <pool name=\"default\">\n        <minShare>0</minShare>\n        <weight>1</weight>\n        <schedulingMode>FIFO</schedulingMode>\n    </pool>\n    <pool name=\"duplicate_pool1\">\n        <minShare>1</minShare>\n        <weight>1</weight>\n        <schedulingMode>FAIR</schedulingMode>\n    </pool>\n    <pool name=\"duplicate_pool1\">\n        <minShare>2</minShare>\n        <weight>2</weight>\n        <schedulingMode>FAIR</schedulingMode>\n    </pool>\n</allocations>\n```\n\n**Debug Screenshot** :\nThe following screenshots show `Pool.schedulableQueue(ConcurrentLinkedQueue[Schedulable])` has **4** pools as \n\n> default, default, duplicate_pool1 and duplicate_pool1\n\n but `Pool.schedulableNameToSchedulable(ConcurrentHashMap[String, Schedulable])` has \n\n> default and duplicate_pool1\n\ndue to pool name as key so one of **default** and **duplicate_pool1** look **redundant** and live in `Pool.schedulableQueue`.\n\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"duplicate_pools\"

(766 milliseconds\n  ```\n\nFor `CreateTableAsSelectSuite` and `FsHistoryProviderSuite`, I could not reproduce as the Java version seems higher than the one that has the bugs about `setReadable(..)` and `setWritable(...)` but as they are bugs reported clearly, it'd be sensible to skip those. We should revert the changes for both back as soon as we drop the support of Java 7.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManually tested via AppVeyor.\n\nCloses

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe function `QueryPlan.inferAdditionalConstraints` and `UnaryNode.getAliasedConstraints` can produce a non-converging set of constraints for recursive functions. For instance, if we have two constraints of the form(where a is an alias):\n`a = b, a = f(b, c)`\nApplying both these rules in the next iteration would infer:\n`f(b, c) = f(f(b, c), c)`\nThis process repeated, the iteration won't converge and the set of constraints will grow larger and larger until OOM.\n\n~~To fix this problem, we collect alias from expressions and skip infer constraints if we are to transform an `Expression` to another which contains it.~~\nTo fix this problem, we apply additional check in `inferAdditionalConstraints`, when it's possible to generate recursive constraints, we skip generate that.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd new testcase in `SQLQuerySuite`/`InferFiltersFromConstraintsSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-10-01T05:03:13Z","updated_at":"2016-10-27T02:03:02Z","closed_at":"2016-10-26T15:12:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c6a04e323d7af5d8bff8a3c07ab9d32ee2b712e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15319/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15319/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15319/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/45308d50de27fb4b6c2c9ee88e55ba808ef5ef6f","head":{"label":"jiangxb1987:constraints","ref":"constraints","sha":"45308d50de27fb4b6c2c9ee88e55ba808ef5ef6f","user":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35214686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTIxNDY4Ng==","name":"spark","full_name":"jiangxb1987/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jiangxb1987","id":4784782,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODQ3ODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4784782?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987","html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jiangxb1987/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jiangxb1987/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nMetrics are needed for monitoring structured streaming apps. Here is the design doc for implementing the necessary metrics.\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1NIdcGuR1B3WIe8t7VxLrt58TJB4DtipWEbj5I_mzJys/edit?usp=sharing\n\nSpecifically, this PR adds the following public APIs changes.\n### New APIs\n- `StreamingQuery.status` returns a `StreamingQueryStatus` object (renamed from `StreamingQueryInfo`, see later)\n- `StreamingQueryStatus` has the following important fields\n  - inputRate - Current rate (rows/sec) at which data is being generated by all the sources\n  - processingRate - Current rate (rows/sec) at which the query is processing data from\n                                all the sources\n  - ~~outputRate~~ - _Does not work with wholestage codegen_\n  - latency - Current average latency between the data being available in source and the sink writing the corresponding output \n  - sourceStatuses: Array[SourceStatus] - Current statuses of the sources\n  - sinkStatus: SinkStatus - Current status of the sink\n  - triggerStatus - Low-level detailed status of the last completed/currently active trigger\n    - latencies - getOffset, getBatch, full trigger, wal writes\n    - timestamps - trigger start, finish, after getOffset, after getBatch\n    - numRows - input, output, state total/updated rows for aggregations\n- `SourceStatus` has the following important fields\n  - inputRate - Current rate (rows/sec) at which data is being generated by the source\n  - processingRate - Current rate (rows/sec) at which the query is processing data from the source\n  - triggerStatus - Low-level detailed status of the last completed/currently active trigger\n- Python API for `StreamingQuery.status()`\n### Breaking changes to existing APIs\n\n**Existing direct public facing APIs**\n- Deprecated direct public-facing APIs `StreamingQuery.sourceStatuses` and `StreamingQuery.sinkStatus` in favour of `StreamingQuery.status.sourceStatuses/sinkStatus`. \n  - Branch 2.0 should have it deprecated, master should have it removed. \n\n**Existing advanced listener APIs**\n- `StreamingQueryInfo` renamed to `StreamingQueryStatus` for consistency with `SourceStatus`, `SinkStatus`\n  - Earlier StreamingQueryInfo was used only in the advanced listener API, but now it is used in direct public-facing API (StreamingQuery.status)\n- Field `queryInfo` in listener events `QueryStarted`, `QueryProgress`, `QueryTerminated` changed have name `queryStatus` and return type `StreamingQueryStatus`.\n- Field `offsetDesc` in `SourceStatus` was Option[String], converted it to `String`. \n- For `SourceStatus` and `SinkStatus` made constructor private instead of private[sql] to make them more java-safe. Instead added `private[sql] object SourceStatus/SinkStatus.apply()` which are harder to accidentally use in Java.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nOld and new unit tests.\n- Rate calculation and other internal logic of StreamMetrics tested by StreamMetricsSuite.\n- New info in statuses returned through StreamingQueryListener is tested in StreamingQueryListenerSuite.\n- New and old info returned through StreamingQuery.status is tested in StreamingQuerySuite.\n- Source-specific tests for making sure input rows are counted are is source-specific test suites.\n- Additional tests to test minor additions in LocalTableScanExec, StateStore, etc.\n\nMetrics also manually tested using Ganglia sink\n","created_at":"2016-09-30T03:33:54Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T19:34:38Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T20:39:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d839750f78118b8e94bd33444ddc49a59d0428d5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15307/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15307/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15307/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/59722126a74a03ca2e0b0e8c2f3e3477a302aad0","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-17731","ref":"SPARK-17731","sha":"59722126a74a03ca2e0b0e8c2f3e3477a302aad0","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs a followup to SPARK-17666, ensure filesystem connections are not leaked at least in unit tests. This is done here by intercepting filesystem calls as suggested by @JoshRosen . At the end of each test, we assert no filesystem streams are left open.\n\nThis applies to all tests using SharedSQLContext or SharedSparkContext.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI verified that tests in sql and core are indeed using the filesystem backend, and fixed the detected leaks. I also checked that reverting https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15245 causes many actual test failures due to connection leaks.\n","created_at":"2016-09-30T01:50:10Z","updated_at":"2017-06-13T01:00:48Z","closed_at":"2016-10-01T06:53:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"06617db7585875ce1abc780762a0a2ff66932cc9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15306/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15306/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15306/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/401b447e906741dc9fb6a755941ac3bfe382d345","head":{"label":"ericl:sc-4672","ref":"sc-4672","sha":"401b447e906741dc9fb6a755941ac3bfe382d345","user":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":23644625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzY0NDYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"ericl/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ericl","id":14922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl","html_url":"https://github.com/ericl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ericl/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ericl/spark","description":"Mirror

Turns out\nthe original fix was correct.\n\nOriginal change description:\nThe existing code caches all stats for all columns for each partition\nin the driver; for a large relation, this causes extreme memory usage,\nwhich leads to gc hell and application failures.\n\nIt seems that only the size in bytes of the data is actually used in the\ndriver, so instead just colllect that. In executors, the full stats are\nstill kept, but that's not a big problem; we expect the data to be distributed\nand thus not really incur in too much memory pressure in each individual\nexecutor.\n\nThere are also potential improvements on the executor side, since the data\nbeing stored currently is very wasteful (e.g. storing boxed types vs.\nprimitive types for stats).

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current user facing catalog does not implement methods for checking object existence or finding objects. You could theoretically do this using the `list*` commands, but this is rather cumbersome and can actually be costly when there are many objects. This PR adds `exists*` and `find*` methods for Databases, Table and Functions.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded tests to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nHive allows inserting data to bucketed table without guaranteeing bucketed and sorted-ness based on these two configs : `hive.enforce.bucketing` and `hive.enforce.sorting`.\r\n\r\nWhat does this PR achieve ?\r\n- Spark will disallow users from writing outputs to hive bucketed tables by default (given that output won't adhere with Hive's semantics).\r\n- IF user still wants to write to hive bucketed table, the only resort is to use `hive.enforce.bucketing=false` and `hive.enforce.sorting=false` which means user does NOT care about bucketing guarantees.\r\n\r\nChanges done in this PR:\r\n- Extract table's bucketing information in `HiveClientImpl`\r\n- While writing table info to metastore, `MetastoreRelation` now populates the bucketing information in the hive `Table` object\r\n- `InsertIntoHiveTable` allows inserts to bucketed table only if both `hive.enforce.bucketing` and `hive.enforce.sorting` are `false`\r\n\r\nAbility to create bucketed tables will enable adding test cases to Spark while I add pieces to make Spark support hive bucketing (eg. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15229, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15047, https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15040)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added test for creating bucketed and sorted table.\r\n- Added test to ensure that INSERTs fail if strict bucket / sort is enforced\r\n- Added test to ensure that INSERTs can go through if strict bucket / sort is NOT enforced\r\n- Added test to validate that bucketing information shows up in output of DESC FORMATTED\r\n- Added test to ensure that `SHOW CREATE TABLE` works for hive bucketed

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n   Generally reducer need fetch all mapper block to deal。But in data skew case，huge data in one reducer, make the running time is too long, or Out Of Memory.  So we need design a new feature to handling skew data join.  Since a reduce to deal with the data is too large, then scattered to a number of reducer for processing.\nIn join case. A join B equal to A1 join B + A2 join B + …. An join B.  So when in join case the data skew occur. Don’t pull all skew data into a reducer do as A join B, but pull one mapper data and whole data about other join side do  as A1 join B + A2 join B + …. An join B.\n\nIn spark sql, we use ShuffedRowRDD to fetch the map side generate date. ShuffedRowRDD only can read  a range of reduce IDs but fetches from all maps. Join operater generate two ShuffedRowRDD, them has the same partition num, and put the same partition id together to join. The ShuffedRowRDD partition  like this:\nShuffledRowRDD 1: [1,3,5,9]\nShuffledRowRDD 2: [1,3,5,9]\n\nFor handling the data skew case. We design a new RDD to read one mapper , we call it SkewShuffleRowRDD. The SkewShuffleRowRDD function getPartitions can generate partition to describe read one or a range of mappers data or read all mappers data.\nThe the two SkewShuffleRowRDD partition like this:\nSkewShuffleRowRDD 1：\n[(1, read all maps),(3, read map 1 to 3),(3,read map 3 to 5),(3,read map 5 to 7),(5, read all maps),(9,read all maps)]\nSkewShuffleRowRDD 2：\n[(1, read all maps),(3, read all maps),(3, read all maps),(3, read all maps),(5, read all maps),(9,read all maps)]\n\nFor determine which partition is data skew,  add a new configure parameter : spark.sql.adaptive.skewjoin.threshold.  when the skew threshold  > map out size. Determine the partition is data skew.\nFor achieve this feature, need add some code in ExchangeCoordinator.scala  to aware the skew partition. If is join operater and find some partition is skew, then generate the SkewShuffleRowRDD instead ShuffleRowRDD\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in ExchangeCoordinatorSuite\n\nalso can generate skew data and  manual test\n\nAuthor:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n- changes the implementation of gemv with transposed SparseMatrix and SparseVector both in mllib-local and mllib (identical)\n- adds a test that was failing before this change, but succeeds with these changes.\n\nThe problem in the previous implementation was that it only increments `i`, that is enumerating the columns of a row in the SparseMatrix, when the row-index of the vector matches the column-index of the SparseMatrix. In cases where a particular row of the SparseMatrix has non-zero values at column-indices lower than corresponding non-zero row-indices of the SparseVector, the non-zero values of the SparseVector are enumerated without ever matching the column-index at index `i` and the remaining column-indices i+1,...,indEnd-1 are never attempted. The test cases in this PR illustrate this issue.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI have run the specific `gemv` tests in both mllib-local and mllib. I am currently still running `./dev/run-tests`. \n## ___\n\nAs per instructions, I hereby state that this is my original work and that I license the work to the project (Apache Spark) under the project's open source license.\n\nMentioning @dbtsai, @viirya and @brkyvz whom I can see have worked/authored on these parts before.\n","created_at":"2016-09-29T11:26:28Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T08:53:58Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T22:42:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07e429c791a4a0321449be9467144851f4fa8b81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15296/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15296/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15296/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cdc36422f6e73dbe239c9d7ed568bbb138fae266","head":{"label":"bwahlgreen:bugfix-spark-17721","ref":"bugfix-spark-17721","sha":"cdc36422f6e73dbe239c9d7ed568bbb138fae266","user":{"login":"bwahlgreen","id":670490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDQ5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen","html_url":"https://github.com/bwahlgreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69469124,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTQ2OTEyNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"bwahlgreen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bwahlgreen","id":670490,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3MDQ5MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/670490?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen","html_url":"https://github.com/bwahlgreen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bwahlgreen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bwahlgreen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSQLConf is session-scoped and mutable. However, we do have the requirement for a static SQL conf, which is global and immutable, e.g. the `schemaStringThreshold` in `HiveExternalCatalog`, the flag to enable/disable hive support, the global temp view database in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/14897.\n\nActually we've already implemented static SQL conf implicitly via `SparkConf`, this PR just make it explicit and expose it to users, so that they can see the config value via SQL command or `SparkSession.conf`, and forbid users to set/unset static SQL conf.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nnew tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR proposes to fix arbitrary usages among `Map[String, String]`, `Properties` and `JDBCOptions` instances for options in `execution/jdbc` package and make the connection properties exclude Spark-only options.\n\nThis PR includes some changes as below:\n- Unify `Map[String, String]`, `Properties` and `JDBCOptions` in `execution/jdbc` package to `JDBCOptions`.\n- Move `batchsize`, `fetchszie`, `driver` and `isolationlevel` options into `JDBCOptions` instance.\n- Document `batchSize` and `isolationlevel` with marking both read-only options and write-only options. Also, this includes minor types and detailed explanation for some statements such as url.\n- Throw exceptions fast by checking arguments first rather than in execution time (e.g. for `fetchsize`).\n- Exclude Spark-only options in connection properties.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting tests should cover this.\n","created_at":"2016-09-29T05:00:25Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:44:16Z","closed_at":"2016-10-11T05:25:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b280fd70fa0f82d2199b6b0314c7e1c53d8f1eb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15292/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15292/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15292/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d7710153acc4942d603cc6cbb09bcc0e1f86be79","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-17719","ref":"SPARK-17719","sha":"d7710153acc4942d603cc6cbb09bcc0e1f86be79","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch fixes a minor correctness issue impacting the pushdown of filters beneath aggregates. Specifically, if a filter condition references no grouping or aggregate columns (e.g. `WHERE false`) then it would be incorrectly pushed beneath an aggregate.\n\nIntuitively, the only case where you can push a filter beneath an aggregate is when that filter is deterministic and is defined over the grouping columns / expressions, since in that case the filter is acting to exclude entire groups from the query (like a `HAVING` clause). The existing code would only push deterministic filters beneath aggregates when all of the filter's references were grouping columns, but this logic missed the case where a filter has no references. For example, `WHERE false` is deterministic but is independent of the actual data.\n\nThis patch fixes this minor bug by adding a new check to ensure that we don't push filters beneath aggregates when those filters don't reference any columns.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNew regression test in FilterPushdownSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-09-28T23:38:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-30T22:52:57Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T02:05:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"114266e6a81072e778124dff1316b44cf13ca2ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/87504e431800e0a99f05df437f9ce6543ca468a4","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-17712","ref":"SPARK-17712","sha":"87504e431800e0a99f05df437f9ce6543ca468a4","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn calling LogisticRegression.evaluate and GeneralizedLinearRegression.evaluate using a Dataset where the Label is not of a double type, calculations pattern match against a double and throw a MatchError.  This fix casts the Label column to a DoubleType to ensure there is no MatchError.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests to call evaluate with a dataset that has Label as other numeric

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nValue classes were unsupported because catalyst data types were\nobtained through reflection on erased types, which would resolve to a\nvalue class' wrapped type and hence lead to unavailable methods during\ncode generation.\n\nE.g. the following class\n\n``` scala\ncase class Foo(x: Int) extends AnyVal\n```\n\nwould be seen as an `int` in catalyst and will cause instance cast failures when generated java code tries to treat it as a `Foo`.\n\nThis patch simply removes the erasure step when getting data types for\ncatalyst.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdditional tests in `ExpressionEncoderSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-09-28T21:51:01Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T00:50:10Z","closed_at":"2016-10-14T00:50:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"05ac591f93762c5e39cfe5f619e7d25e8339d3d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15284/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15284/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15284/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a3dce9f5f9ced492fa6f20b93497856fd51fc757","head":{"label":"jodersky:value-classes","ref":"value-classes","sha":"a3dce9f5f9ced492fa6f20b93497856fd51fc757","user":{"login":"jodersky","id":1007012,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDcwMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1007012?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky","html_url":"https://github.com/jodersky","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jodersky/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"a6cfa3f38bcf6ba154d5ed2a53748fbc90c8872a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe discussion of the interaction of Accumulators and Broadcast Variables should logically follow the discussion on Checkpointing. As currently written, this section discusses Checkpointing before it is formally introduced. To remedy this:\n- Rename this section to \"Accumulators, Broadcast Variables, and Checkpoints\", and\n- Move this section after \"Checkpointing\".\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTesting: ran\n\n$ SKIP_API=1 jekyll build\n\n, and verified changes in a Web browser pointed at

PR addresses [SPARK-12347](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12347?jql=project%20%3D%20SPARK%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20component%20%3D%20ML%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC) and may also be helpful for [SPARK-15571](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-15571).\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a python script to drive all the examples located in the `examples` subdirectory. It should be able to streamline the testing of the examples in R, Python, Scala and Java to see if any of them has incompatible behavior with the codebase.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR is not yet fully ready for merging. I would like to have some reviews for how it works best for those who will indeed be using this script. For now, it introduces the following features:\r\n- [ ] Configuring according to environment variables.\r\n- [ ] **Run those examples requiring arguments to be passed in.**\r\n- [x] select examples of a specific language to run (R, Python, Scala or Java)\r\n- [x] running in parallem (like that in run-test.py)\r\n\r\nNote that the last TODO is really important, for that I would like to hear suggestions from the reviewers for how it should should be best implemented. For now, I think one good way will be to have comments as directives in the example code. Like how `# $example on$` are introduced to facilitate doc generation. We can do something similar to hint what arguments should be passed in for testing. Otherwise, we can always fall back to the way we discussed in the JIRA [SPARK-12347](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-12347)\r\n\r\nAlso, some of the functionality replicates that in run-tests.py. Perhaps we can find a way to integrate both?\r\n","created_at":"2016-09-28T13:02:35Z","updated_at":"2017-05-12T18:43:29Z","closed_at":"2017-05-12T18:43:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c7b5ab79dfd0a0b8eea8e420472b966d2ad232ab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15279/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15279/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15279/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/276eddd749ee4a9101be65039be57e1f5a180b58","head":{"label":"ethanluoyc:test-examples","ref":"test-examples","sha":"276eddd749ee4a9101be65039be57e1f5a180b58","user":{"login":"ethanluoyc","id":6040760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDA3NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6040760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc","html_url":"https://github.com/ethanluoyc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69460822,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTQ2MDgyMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"ethanluoyc/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ethanluoyc","id":6040760,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNDA3NjA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6040760?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc","html_url":"https://github.com/ethanluoyc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ethanluoyc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ethanluoyc/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSeveral performance improvement for `ChiSqSelector`:\n1, Keep `selectedFeatures` ordered ascendent.\n`ChiSqSelectorModel.transform` need `selectedFeatures` ordered to make prediction. We should sort it when training model rather than making prediction, since users usually train model once and use the model to do prediction multiple times. \n2, When training `fpr` type `ChiSqSelectorModel`, it's not necessary to sort the ChiSq test result by statistic.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere are many minor objects in references, which are extracted to the generated class field, e.g. `errMsg` in `GetExternalRowField` or `ValidateExternalType`, but number of fields in class is limited so we should reduce the number.\nThis pr adds unnamed version of `addReferenceObj` for these minor objects not to store the object into field but refer it from the `references` field at the time of use.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

SQL has great support for reading text files that contain JSON data.  However, in many cases the JSON data is just one column amongst others.  This is particularly true when reading from sources such as Kafka.  This PR adds a new functions `from_json` that converts a string column into a nested `StructType` with a user specified schema.\n\nExample usage:\n\n``` scala\nval df = Seq(\"\"\"{\"a\": 1}\"\"\").toDS()\nval schema = new StructType().add(\"a\", IntegerType)\n\ndf.select(from_json($\"value\", schema) as 'json) // => [json: <a: int>]\n```\n\nThis PR adds support for java, scala and python.  I leveraged our existing JSON parsing support by moving it into catalyst (so that we could define expressions using it).  I left SQL out for now, because I'm not sure how users would specify a schema.\n","created_at":"2016-09-28T02:56:22Z","updated_at":"2017-03-04T19:16:04Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T20:04:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"25d261c430b653f889b6bdf0ee3a50e3d19dc2a3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15274/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15274/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15274/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/360b97b7ebd9a0062b1bd65b1a536815420be1ed","head":{"label":"marmbrus:jsonParser","ref":"jsonParser","sha":"360b97b7ebd9a0062b1bd65b1a536815420be1ed","user":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17230869,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMDg2OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"marmbrus/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marmbrus","id":527,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/527?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus","html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marmbrus/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marmbrus/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17698\n\n`ExtractEquiJoinKeys` is incorrectly using filter predicates as the join condition for joins. `canEvaluate` [0] tries to see if the an `Expression` can be evaluated using output of a given `Plan`. In case of filter predicates (eg. `a.id='1'`), the `Expression` passed for the right hand side (ie. '1' ) is a `Literal` which does not have any attribute references. Thus `expr.references` is an empty set which theoretically is a subset of any set. This leads to `canEvaluate` returning `true` and `a.id='1'` is treated as a join predicate. While this does not lead to incorrect results but in case of bucketed + sorted tables, we might miss out on avoiding un-necessary shuffle + sort. See example below:\n\n[0] : https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/predicates.scala#L91\n\neg.\n\n```\nval df = (1 until 10).toDF(\"id\").coalesce(1)\nhc.sql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table1\").collect\ndf.write.bucketBy(8, \"id\").sortBy(\"id\").saveAsTable(\"table1\")\nhc.sql(\"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table2\").collect\ndf.write.bucketBy(8, \"id\").sortBy(\"id\").saveAsTable(\"table2\")\n\nsqlContext.sql(\"\"\"\n  SELECT a.id, b.id\n  FROM table1 a\n  FULL OUTER JOIN table2 b\n  ON a.id = b.id AND a.id='1' AND b.id='1'\n\"\"\").explain(true)\n```\n\nBEFORE: This is doing shuffle + sort over table scan outputs which is not needed as both tables are bucketed and sorted on the same columns and have same number of buckets. This should be a single stage job.\n\n```\nSortMergeJoin [id#38, cast(id#38 as double), 1.0], [id#39, 1.0, cast(id#39 as double)], FullOuter\n:- *Sort [id#38 ASC NULLS FIRST, cast(id#38 as double) ASC NULLS FIRST, 1.0 ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\n:  +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#38, cast(id#38 as double), 1.0, 200)\n:     +- *FileScan parquet default.table1[id#38] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:spark-warehouse/table1, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\n+- *Sort [id#39 ASC NULLS FIRST, 1.0 ASC NULLS FIRST, cast(id#39 as double) ASC NULLS FIRST], false, 0\n   +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#39, 1.0, cast(id#39 as double), 200)\n      +- *FileScan parquet default.table2[id#39] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:spark-warehouse/table2, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\n```\n\nAFTER :\n\n```\nSortMergeJoin [id#32], [id#33], FullOuter, ((cast(id#32 as double) = 1.0) && (cast(id#33 as double) = 1.0))\n:- *FileScan parquet default.table1[id#32] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:spark-warehouse/table1, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\n+- *FileScan parquet default.table2[id#33] Batched: true, Format: ParquetFormat, InputPaths: file:spark-warehouse/table2, PartitionFilters: [], PushedFilters: [], ReadSchema: struct<id:int>\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Added a new test case for this scenario : `SPARK-17698 Join predicates should not contain filter clauses`\n- Ran all the tests in

is a branch-2.0 backport of #15245.\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch addresses a potential cause of resource leaks in data source file scans. As reported in [SPARK-17666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17666), tasks which do not fully-consume their input may cause file handles / network connections (e.g. S3 connections) to be leaked. Spark's `NewHadoopRDD` uses a TaskContext callback to [close its record readers](https://github.com/apache/spark/blame/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/NewHadoopRDD.scala#L208), but the new data source file scans will only close record readers once their iterators are fully-consumed.\n\nThis patch modifies `RecordReaderIterator` and `HadoopFileLinesReader` to add `close()` methods and modifies all six implementations of `FileFormat.buildReader()` to register TaskContext task completion callbacks to guarantee that cleanup is eventually performed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually for now.\n","created_at":"2016-09-28T01:32:42Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T18:21:26Z","closed_at":"2016-09-28T18:21:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cb3438612d37f59b5309cba4e35a3a226578baa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15271/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15271/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15271/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c0621dbbd558e3715ea3b0c250913c1b94e34478","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-17666-backport","ref":"SPARK-17666-backport","sha":"c0621dbbd558e3715ea3b0c250913c1b94e34478","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

the original commit message:\n\nThis PR also fixes a regression caused by [SPARK-10987] whereby submitting a shutdown causes a race between the local shutdown procedure and the notification of the scheduler driver disconnection. If the scheduler driver disconnection wins the race, the coarse executor incorrectly exits with status 1 (instead of the proper status 0)\n\nAuthor: Charles Allen charles@allen-net.com\n\n(cherry

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe name of Spark Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server in web UI reflects the name of the class, i.e. org.apache.spark.sql.hive.thrift.HiveThriftServer2. I changed it to Thrift JDBC/ODBC Server (like Spark shell for spark-shell) as recommended by @jaceklaskowski. Note the user can still change the name adding `--name \"App Name\"` parameter to the start script as before\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nBy running the script with various parameters and checking the web ui\n\n![screen shot 2016-09-27 at 12 19 12

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFollowing up on the discussion in SPARK-15725, one of the reason for AM hanging with dynamic allocation(DA) is the way locking is done in YarnAllocator. We noticed that when executors go down during the shrink phase of DA, AM gets locked up. On taking thread dump, we see threads trying to get loss for reason via YarnAllocator#enqueueGetLossReasonRequest, and they are all BLOCKED waiting for lock acquired by allocate call. This gets worse when the number of executors go down are in the thousands, and I've seen AM hang in the order of minutes. This patch is created to make the locking little more fine grained by remembering the executors that were killed via AM, and then serve the GetExecutorLossReason requests with that information.\n\nThis patch is not final. I want to get inputs on how I can go about removing executors from the `executorsKilledByDriver` set. Also if there is a better way to solve this, would be happy to make the changes.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis was tested in our cluster with manually scaling the number of executors to thousands and then shrinking them down to something small, and made sure that we don't see BLOCKED threads stuck at

patch ports changes from #15185 to Spark 2.x. In that patch, a  correctness bug in Spark 1.6.x which was caused by an invalid `equals()` comparison between an `UnsafeRow` and another row of a different format. Spark 2.x is not affected by that specific correctness bug but it can still reap the error-prevention benefits of that patch's changes, which modify  ``UnsafeRow.equals()` to throw an IllegalArgumentException if it is called with an object that is not an `UnsafeRow`.\n","created_at":"2016-09-27T18:32:59Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T21:20:44Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T21:16:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5ee4bb8d53905004fdd5be4bf8484dd55baca21","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15265/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15265/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15265/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f4de93fa70bb66c1f9d1135ec45d31861e950a8b","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-17618-master","ref":"SPARK-17618-master","sha":"f4de93fa70bb66c1f9d1135ec45d31861e950a8b","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nUsing SparkSession in Spark 2.0 to read a Hive table which is stored as parquet files and if there has been a schema evolution from int to long of a column, we will get java.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.MutableLong cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.MutableInt. To be specific, if there are some old parquet files using int for the column while some new parquet files use long and the Hive metastore uses Long as its type, the aforementioned exception will be thrown. Because Hive and Presto deem this kind of schema evolution is valid, this PR allows writing a int value when its table schema is long in hive metastore.\n\nThis is for non-vectorized parquet reader only.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nManual test to create parquet files with int type in the schema and create hive table using long as its type. Then perform spark.sql(\"select \\* from table\") to query all data from this table.\n","created_at":"2016-09-27T18:09:54Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T09:19:44Z","closed_at":"2017-02-17T09:19:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"45935f5de2ed29abd5ffed14ed87b1428b80baa2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15264/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15264/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15264/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1f6ea811cec5b8f4d9ea4df267e8d60b11477044","head":{"label":"wgtmac:SPARK-17477","ref":"SPARK-17477","sha":"1f6ea811cec5b8f4d9ea4df267e8d60b11477044","user":{"login":"wgtmac","id":4684607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODQ2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4684607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac","html_url":"https://github.com/wgtmac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":52826553,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MjgyNjU1Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"wgtmac/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wgtmac","id":4684607,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2ODQ2MDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4684607?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac","html_url":"https://github.com/wgtmac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wgtmac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wgtmac/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n#14035 added `testImplicits` to ML unit tests and promoted `toDF()`, but left one minor issue at `VectorIndexerSuite`. If we create the DataFrame by `Seq(...).toDF()`, it will throw different error/exception compared with `sc.parallelize(Seq(...)).toDF()` for one of the test cases.\n\nAfter in-depth study, I found it was caused by different behavior of local and distributed Dataset if the UDF failed at `assert`. If the data is local Dataset, it throws `AssertionError` directly; If the data is distributed Dataset, it throws `SparkException` which is the wrapper of `AssertionError`. I think we should enforce this test to cover both case.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit test.\n","created_at":"2016-09-27T11:15:17Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T07:59:02Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T07:56:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e11295a944b030d139137e0f3eb6d21edc66c7d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15261/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15261/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15261/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c24021e4a24413426ae01fbbbc39d1a21e7aaf88","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-16356","ref":"spark-16356","sha":"c24021e4a24413426ae01fbbbc39d1a21e7aaf88","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark SQL supports Unicode characters for column names when specified within backticks(`). When the Hive support is enabled, the version of the Hive metastore must be higher than 0.12,  See the JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6013 Hive metastore supports Unicode characters for column names since 0.13. \r\n\r\nIn Spark SQL, table comments, and view comments always allow Unicode characters without backticks.\r\n\r\nBTW, a separate PR has been submitted for database and table name validation because we do not support Unicode characters in these two cases. \r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAs of Spark 2.0, all the window function execution code are in WindowExec.scala. This file is pretty large (over 1k loc) and has a lot of different abstractions in them. This patch creates a new package sql.execution.window, moves WindowExec.scala in it, and breaks WindowExec.scala into multiple, more maintainable pieces:\n- AggregateProcessor.scala\n- BoundOrdering.scala\n- RowBuffer.scala\n- WindowExec\n- WindowFunctionFrame.scala\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis patch mostly moves code around, and should not change any existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nFsHistoryProvider was writing a hidden file (to check the fs's clock).\nEven though it deleted the file immediately, sometimes another thread\nwould try to scan the files on the fs in-between, and then there would\nbe an error msg logged which was very misleading for the end-user.\n(The logged error was harmless, though.)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI added one unit test, but to be clear, that test was passing before.  The actual change in behavior in that test is just logging (after the change, there is no more logged error), which I just manually verified.\n","created_at":"2016-09-27T03:09:11Z","updated_at":"2016-09-29T22:42:12Z","closed_at":"2016-09-29T22:42:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"57b0ef30a8910c5ecd37ce678a0ab62e8a77f8cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15250/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15250/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15250/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2d37bd33235f673392b17613b7615edf6a0a0604","head":{"label":"squito:SPARK-17676","ref":"SPARK-17676","sha":"2d37bd33235f673392b17613b7615edf6a0a0604","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis is a step along the way to SPARK-8425.\n\nTo enable incremental review, the first step proposed here is to expand the blacklisting within tasksets. In particular, this will enable blacklisting for\n- (task, executor) pairs (this already exists via an undocumented config)\n- (task, node)\n- (taskset, executor)\n- (taskset, node)\n\nAdding (task, node) is critical to making spark fault-tolerant of one-bad disk in a cluster, without requiring careful tuning of \"spark.task.maxFailures\". The other additions are also important to avoid many misleading task failures and long scheduling delays when there is one bad node on a large cluster.\n\nNote that some of the code changes here aren't really required for just this -- they put pieces in place for SPARK-8425 even though they are not used yet (eg. the `BlacklistTracker` helper is a little out of place, `TaskSetBlacklist` holds onto a little more info than it needs to for just this change, and `ExecutorFailuresInTaskSet` is more complex than it needs to be).\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded unit tests, run tests via jenkins.\n","created_at":"2016-09-27T02:07:40Z","updated_at":"2016-10-26T18:54:59Z","closed_at":"2016-10-12T21:45:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f196f1308ad7ccfb5ad1f0091fc664edbf5beced","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15249/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15249/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15249/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4501e6c089f99f2cc62443cca668f77fea2745aa","head":{"label":"squito:taskset_blacklist_only","ref":"taskset_blacklist_only","sha":"4501e6c089f99f2cc62443cca668f77fea2745aa","user":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":29212749,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTIxMjc0OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"squito/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"squito","id":71240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/71240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito","html_url":"https://github.com/squito","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/squito/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/squito/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nAdded a new API getApplicationInfo(appId: String) in class ApplicationHistoryProvider and class SparkUI to get app info. In this change, FsHistoryProvider can directly fetch one app info in O(1) time complexity compared to O(n) before the change which used an Iterator.find() interface.\n\nBoth ApplicationCache and OneApplicationResource classes adopt this new api.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n manual

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis patch addresses a potential cause of resource leaks in data source file scans. As reported in [SPARK-17666](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17666), tasks which do not fully-consume their input may cause file handles / network connections (e.g. S3 connections) to be leaked. Spark's `NewHadoopRDD` uses a TaskContext callback to [close its record readers](https://github.com/apache/spark/blame/master/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/rdd/NewHadoopRDD.scala#L208), but the new data source file scans will only close record readers once their iterators are fully-consumed.\n\nThis patch modifies `RecordReaderIterator` and `HadoopFileLinesReader` to add `close()` methods and modifies all six implementations of `FileFormat.buildReader()` to register TaskContext task completion callbacks to guarantee that cleanup is eventually performed.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested manually for now.\n","created_at":"2016-09-26T20:38:50Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T01:37:00Z","closed_at":"2016-09-28T00:55:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6add063f90773e33b3e2ded0d719f91e5cd53d5b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15245/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15245/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15245/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e4b8577ed71a30f4ad220cd1a2f19a8edd596c64","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-17666-close-recordreader","ref":"SPARK-17666-close-recordreader","sha":"e4b8577ed71a30f4ad220cd1a2f19a8edd596c64","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-17556\nDesign doc : \nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12830668/executor%20broadcast.pdf\n\nAdded two api for RDD to perform executor side broadcast and apply it on sql's broadcast join.\n\n[1].  `def broadcast[U: ClassTag](f: Iterator[T] => U): Broadcast[U]`\n\nUser only need pass a function to describe how to translate all the element of the rdd to the value they want to broadcast\n\n[2]. `def broadcast[U: ClassTag](transFunc: TransFunc[T, U]): Broadcast[U]`\n\nThis is only used in spark sql(spark internal), TransFunc is a interface to describe how to translate all the element of the rdd to a single value.\nTransFunc is inherited by BroadcastMode in spark sql.\n\nWhen construct broadcast, firstly it write blocks to block manager from executor and then create `Broadcast` from driver(not write blocks)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nadded unit test and manual test.\n","created_at":"2016-09-26T11:44:10Z","updated_at":"2017-08-05T13:01:31Z","closed_at":"2017-08-05T13:01:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b65507f4a3a765f9fe70304a0ab8fd76296fe2e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15240/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15240/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15240/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a547a63913f95e990f0f16bf6ce559a25e3b5f7","head":{"label":"KirinKing:SPARK-17556","ref":"SPARK-17556","sha":"4a547a63913f95e990f0f16bf6ce559a25e3b5f7","user":{"login":"KirinKing","id":7459181,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0NTkxODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7459181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing","html_url":"https://github.com/KirinKing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69000974,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTAwMDk3NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"KirinKing/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"KirinKing","id":7459181,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjc0NTkxODE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7459181?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing","html_url":"https://github.com/KirinKing","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KirinKing/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/KirinKing/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently for `Union [Distinct]`, a `Distinct` operator is necessary to be on the top of `Union`. Once there are adjacent `Union [Distinct]`,  there will be multiple `Distinct` in the query plan.\n\nE.g.,\n\nFor a query like: select 1 a union select 2 b union select 3 c\n\nBefore this patch, its physical plan looks like:\n\n```\n*HashAggregate(keys=[a#13], functions=[])\n+- Exchange hashpartitioning(a#13, 200)\n   +- *HashAggregate(keys=[a#13], functions=[])\n      +- Union\n         :-

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIf `spark.scheduler.allocation.file` has invalid `minShare` or/and `weight` values, these cause :\n- `NumberFormatException` due to `toInt` function\n- `SparkContext` can not be initialized.\n- It does not show meaningful error message to user.\n\nIn a nutshell, this functionality can be more robust by selecting one of the following flows :\n\n**1-** Currently, if `schedulingMode` has an invalid value, a warning message is logged and default value is set as `FIFO`. Same pattern can be used for `minShare`(default: 0) and `weight`(default: 1) as well\n**2-** Meaningful error message can be shown to the user for all invalid cases.\n\nPR offers :\n- `schedulingMode` handles just empty values. It also needs to be supported for **whitespace**, **non-uppercase**(fair, FaIr etc...) or `SchedulingMode.NONE` cases by setting default value(`FIFO`)\n- `minShare` and `weight` handle just empty values. They also need to be supported for **non-integer** cases by setting default values.\n- Some refactoring of `PoolSuite`.\n\n**Code to Reproduce :**\n\n```\nval conf = new SparkConf().setAppName(\"spark-fairscheduler\").setMaster(\"local\")\nconf.set(\"spark.scheduler.mode\", \"FAIR\")\nconf.set(\"spark.scheduler.allocation.file\", \"src/main/resources/fairscheduler-invalid-data.xml\")\nval sc = new SparkContext(conf)\n```\n\n**fairscheduler-invalid-data.xml :**\n\n```\n<allocations>\n    <pool name=\"production\">\n        <schedulingMode>FIFO</schedulingMode>\n        <weight>invalid_weight</weight>\n        <minShare>2</minShare>\n    </pool>\n</allocations>\n```\n\n**Stacktrace :**\n\n```\nException in thread

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThere are 4 listLeafFiles-related functions in Spark:\n- ListingFileCatalog.listLeafFiles (which calls HadoopFsRelation.listLeafFilesInParallel if the number of paths passed in is greater than a threshold; if it is lower, then it has its own serial version implemented)\n- HadoopFsRelation.listLeafFiles (called only by HadoopFsRelation.listLeafFilesInParallel)\n- HadoopFsRelation.listLeafFilesInParallel (called only by ListingFileCatalog.listLeafFiles)\n\nIt is actually very confusing and error prone because there are effectively two distinct implementations for the serial version of listing leaf files. As an example, SPARK-17599 updated only one of the code path and ignored the other one.\n\nThis code can be improved by:\n- Move all file listing code into ListingFileCatalog, since it is the only class that needs this.\n- Keep only one function for listing files in serial.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis change should be covered by existing unit and integration tests. I also moved a test case for HadoopFsRelation.shouldFilterOut from HadoopFsRelationSuite to ListingFileCatalogSuite.\n","created_at":"2016-09-25T06:30:27Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T21:18:39Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T21:18:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2e3aec899463aa1211f1707b9761fa0363828b87","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15235/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15235/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15235/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/3c99c3c6ea586712f72968ee2d6fe6c2094e6530","head":{"label":"petermaxlee:SPARK-17661","ref":"SPARK-17661","sha":"3c99c3c6ea586712f72968ee2d6fe6c2094e6530","user":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":62184923,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MjE4NDkyMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"petermaxlee/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"petermaxlee","id":20197098,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTk3MDk4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20197098?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee","html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/petermaxlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/petermaxlee/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\n`write.df`/`read.df` API require path which is not actually always necessary in Spark. Currently, it only affects the datasources implementing `CreatableRelationProvider`. Currently, Spark currently does not have internal data sources implementing this but it'd affect other external datasources.\n\nIn addition we'd be able to use this way in Spark's JDBC datasource after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12601 is merged.\n\n**Before**\n- `read.df`\n  \n  ``` r\n  > read.df(source = \"json\")\n  Error in dispatchFunc(\"read.df(path = NULL, source = NULL, schema = NULL, ...)\",  :\n  argument \"x\" is missing with no default\n  ```\n  \n  ``` r\n  > read.df(path = c(1, 2))\n  Error in dispatchFunc(\"read.df(path = NULL, source = NULL, schema = NULL, ...)\",  :\n  argument \"x\" is missing with no default\n  ```\n  \n  ``` r\n  > read.df(c(1, 2))\n  Error in invokeJava(isStatic = TRUE, className, methodName, ...) :\n  java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Double cannot be cast to java.lang.String\n    at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.hasMetadata(DataSource.scala:300)\n    at\n  ...\n  In if (is.na(object)) { :\n  ...\n  ```\n- `write.df`\n  \n  ``` r\n  > write.df(df, source = \"json\")\n  Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  :\n  unable to find an inherited method for function ‘write.df’ for signature ‘\"function\", \"missing\"’\n  ```\n  \n  ``` r\n  > write.df(df, source = c(1, 2))\n  Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  :\n  unable to find an inherited method for function ‘write.df’ for signature ‘\"SparkDataFrame\", \"missing\"’\n  ```\n  \n  ``` r\n  > write.df(df, mode = TRUE)\n  Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  :\n  unable to find an inherited method for function ‘write.df’ for signature ‘\"SparkDataFrame\", \"missing\"’\n  ```\n\n**After**\n- `read.df`\n  \n  ``` r\n  > read.df(source = \"json\")\n  Error in loadDF : analysis error - Unable to infer schema for JSON at . It must be specified manually;\n  ```\n  \n  ``` r\n  > read.df(path = c(1, 2))\n  Error in f(x, ...) : path should be charactor, null or omitted.\n  ```\n  \n  ``` r\n  > read.df(c(1, 2))\n  Error in f(x, ...) : path should be charactor, null or omitted.\n  ```\n- `write.df`\n  \n  ``` r\n  > write.df(df, source = \"json\")\n  Error in save : illegal argument - 'path' is not specified\n  ```\n  \n  ``` r\n  > write.df(df, source = c(1, 2))\n  Error in .local(df, path, ...) :\n  source should be charactor, null or omitted. It is 'parquet' by default.\n  ```\n  \n  ``` r\n  > write.df(df, mode = TRUE)\n  Error in .local(df, path, ...) :\n  mode should be charactor or omitted. It is 'error' by default.\n  ```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nHive allows users to change the table type from `Managed` to `External` or from `External` to `Managed` by altering table's property `EXTERNAL`. See the JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1329\n\nSo far, Spark SQL does not correctly support it, although users can do it. Many assumptions are broken in the implementation. Thus, this PR is to disallow users to change it.\n\nIn addition, we also do not allow users to set the property `EXTERNAL` when creating a table.\n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases\n","created_at":"2016-09-24T06:50:51Z","updated_at":"2016-10-13T13:39:11Z","closed_at":"2016-10-13T13:39:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea7654f530eca62b38b24c4c1d3ad4307aeaf82c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15230/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15230/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15230/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/330913e7962d408f407a981d8b46d8b17e1af243","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:alterTableSetExternal","ref":"alterTableSetExternal","sha":"330913e7962d408f407a981d8b46d8b17e1af243","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR depends on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15300 and includes following changes to have better planning for Hive bucketed tables:\n- `HiveTableScanExec` now exposes `outputPartitioning` and `outputOrdering` as per bucketing spec.\n- `InsertIntoHiveTable` now exposes `requiredChildDistribution` and `requiredChildOrdering` based on the target table's bucketing spec.\n\nDespite of this PR, Spark still won't produce bucketed data as per Hive's bucketing guarantees, but will allow writes IFF user wishes to do so without caring about bucketing guarantees. I am incrementally working on closing the gaps to have complete Hive bucketing support in Spark but those will be separate PRs (eg. PR to add Hive's hashing function https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15047)\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nThis PR depends on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15300 to let Spark create hive bucketed tables. Once that gets in, I can write unit tests for this PR.\n","created_at":"2016-09-24T05:41:34Z","updated_at":"2017-03-09T05:18:45Z","closed_at":"2017-03-09T05:18:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7a3a04d492bcbb115f8ef65018092e537e4a7aaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15229/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15229/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15229/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/23986a89787a7f9ba24ef5ccce842a13165d0d9d","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:SPARK-17654_hive_extract_bucketing","ref":"SPARK-17654_hive_extract_bucketing","sha":"23986a89787a7f9ba24ef5ccce842a13165d0d9d","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently Spark does not respect bucketing for Hive tables. This PR includes following changes:\n- will extract table's bucketing information in `HiveClientImpl`\n- while writing table info to metastore, `MetastoreRelation` now populates the bucketing information in the hive `Table` object\n- `HiveTableScanExec` now exposes `outputPartitioning` and `outputOrdering` as per bucketing spec.\n- `InsertIntoHiveTable` now exposes `requiredChildDistribution` and `requiredChildOrdering` based on the target table's bucketing spec.\n\nTODOs (which will be done in linked PRs and not this one):\n- [ ] `ClusteredDistribution` does not guarantee the number of partitions (which corresponds to output bucket files created) generated. This will require adding strict guarantees to `ClusteredDistribution`. I think it will need more thought and better to do incrementally and not packing in this PR.\n- [ ] While writing to bucketed files, Hive's hashing function should be used. I have a PR open to implement Hive hashing native in Spark : https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15047\n- [ ] Allow creating Hive bucketed tables\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested with Hive tables created locally. Adding a new test case will need implementing bucketed table creation which is not supported :( Suggestions welcome.\n","created_at":"2016-09-24T02:44:41Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T05:38:23Z","closed_at":"2016-09-24T04:31:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15228/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/15228/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/15228/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7c382524a959a2bc9b3d2fca44f6f0b41aba4e3c","head":{"label":"tejasapatil:SPARK-17654_hive_extract_bucketing","ref":"SPARK-17654_hive_extract_bucketing","sha":"7c382524a959a2bc9b3d2fca44f6f0b41aba4e3c","user":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":50031489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1MDAzMTQ4OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"tejasapatil/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tejasapatil","id":3230057,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzAwNTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3230057?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil","html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tejasapatil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tejasapatil/spark","description":"Mirror
