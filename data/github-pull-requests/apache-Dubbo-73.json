Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-25T08:59:05Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T06:12:34Z","closed_at":"2018-04-26T06:12:34Z","merged_at":"2018-04-26T06:12:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"98626783ab0ff92a66d432d3c3959100ea88f0c7","assignee":{"login":"justinmclean","id":144504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDUwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmclean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"justinmclean","id":144504,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NDUwNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/144504?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean","html_url":"https://github.com/justinmclean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinmclean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15/labels","id":3123638,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzEyMzYzOA==","number":15,"title":"2.6.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-02-17T02:48:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1672/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1672/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1672/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0d7b02c805336cb26f268992eb383517de2b2e73","head":{"label":"ralf0131:ip-clearance","ref":"ip-clearance","sha":"0d7b02c805336cb26f268992eb383517de2b2e73","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf013

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThere was an issue that Spring `ApplicationContext` will register some `@Service` annotation beans with different version as a Spring Bean.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRefactor `@Service` annotation bean name should be composed by those meta data at least:\r\n* `@Service#interfaceName`\r\n* `@Service#version`\r\n* `@Service#group`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun `ServiceAnnotationBeanPostProcessorTest`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-23T13:46:59Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T02:21:18Z","closed_at":"2018-04-24T02:21:05Z","merged_at":"2018-04-24T02:21:05Z","merge_commit_sha":"d07c64f809361ec629b738ca223c7e89d08c03f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15/labels","id":3123638,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzEyMzYzOA==","number":15,"title":"2.6.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-02-17T02:48:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1663/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1663/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1663/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5bab1417d85ae63485ee6656baa3fef3a52e1f33","head":{"label":"mercyblitz:master","ref":"master","sha":"5bab1417d85ae63485ee6656baa3fef3a52e1f33","user":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96880522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Njg4MDUyMg==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mercyblitz/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun `ServiceAnnotationBeanPostProcessorTest`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

install locally\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-19T07:27:41Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T10:55:05Z","closed_at":"2018-04-20T08:02:35Z","merged_at":"2018-04-20T08:02:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"d43faf447bf7e9b99ce189fe60f176e094920d39","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15/labels","id":3123638,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzEyMzYzOA==","number":15,"title":"2.6.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-02-17T02:48:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8ddfd08fdf0595d9591bcf535a1342946a903855","head":{"label":"ralf0131:update_schema","ref":"update_schema","sha":"8ddfd08fdf0595d9591bcf535a1342946a903855","user":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119020526,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTkwMjA1MjY=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"ralf0131/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ralf0131","id":4397305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTczMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4397305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131","html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ralf0131/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ralf0131/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-19T02:32:45Z","updated_at":"2018-05-31T13:38:46Z","closed_at":"2018-04-19T03:13:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"81e298f2fadd53102cbc0168f558b4393e3160c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b155c18ef9d24a2503a7b6d98ae3ad17473c59b3","head":{"label":"zonghaishang:active_checkstyle_for_jdk7","ref":"active_checkstyle_for_jdk7","sha":"b155c18ef9d24a2503a7b6d98ae3ad17473c59b3","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121260009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEyNjAwMDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zonghaishang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang/dubbo","description":"Open

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nStart dubbo in a more elegant way, see： https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/1626\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1.  enhancement for dubbo-demo startup.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. run `com.alibaba.dubbo.demo.provider.Provider#main`\r\n2. run `com.alibaba.dubbo.demo.consumer.Consumer#main`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-18T16:30:43Z","updated_at":"2018-05-22T06:01:52Z","closed_at":"2018-05-22T06:01:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a9633947cf06b5bb0ea4a77e79a7f0e22622c00","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/17","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/17/labels","id":3285726,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzI4NTcyNg==","number":17,"title":"2.6.3","description":"A

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`.

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-16T03:59:31Z","updated_at":"2018-04-16T04:43:29Z","closed_at":"2018-04-16T04:43:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d7ddb8bf04653b5f113dbd54883d5efd44af4691","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e7764a75ce1c8f182e5480f92ba3361de2baecf4","head":{"label":"youngqiankun:master","ref":"master","sha":"e7764a75ce1c8f182e5480f92ba3361de2baecf4","user":{"login":"youngqiankun","id":6263774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjM3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6263774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun","html_url":"https://github.com/youngqiankun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":76526543,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NjUyNjU0Mw==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"youngqiankun/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"youngqiankun","id":6263774,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNjM3NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6263774?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun","html_url":"https://github.com/youngqiankun","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/youngqiankun/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/youngqiankun/dubbo","description":":loudspeaker:

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-15T08:58:29Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T10:55:28Z","closed_at":"2018-04-21T06:08:04Z","merged_at":"2018-04-21T06:08:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"a05f72c63c282047555cb610803b2436f5003c1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15/labels","id":3123638,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzEyMzYzOA==","number":15,"title":"2.6.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-02-17T02:48:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1612/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1612/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1612/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0eae6c5a758f23afee82f27868c2b144c1a68cc8","head":{"label":"bearDream:dev","ref":"dev","sha":"0eae6c5a758f23afee82f27868c2b144c1a68cc8","user":{"login":"bearDream","id":19506640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTA2NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19506640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream","html_url":"https://github.com/bearDream","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":129592469,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjk1OTI0Njk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"bearDream/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bearDream","id":19506640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTA2NjQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19506640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream","html_url":"https://github.com/bearDream","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bearDream/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bearDream/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

[Enhancement] Add configuration properties of binder for Dubbo's config beans #1464\r\n* [Enhancement] Dubbo Config Bindings supports customized DataBinder #1278\r\n* [Refactor] ReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor add Ops methods #1277\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun test-cases\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-15T07:48:55Z","updated_at":"2018-04-23T09:57:26Z","closed_at":"2018-04-23T04:19:33Z","merged_at":"2018-04-23T04:19:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"a2a7706a07897bc7d0dc79923dc724159766da78","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/15","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/15/labels","id":3123638,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzEyMzYzOA==","number":15,"title":"2.6.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":35,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-02-17T02:48:36Z","updated_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2018-05-20T08:25:17Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1611/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1611/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1611/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5d72ddf8eccf48b35cdd9956811a8aeb2986c7d8","head":{"label":"mercyblitz:master","ref":"master","sha":"5d72ddf8eccf48b35cdd9956811a8aeb2986c7d8","user":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96880522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Njg4MDUyMg==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mercyblitz/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz/dubbo","description":":loudspeaker:

ReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor add Ops methods #1277\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun test-cases\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-15T06:33:41Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T10:43:38Z","closed_at":"2018-04-15T07:47:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e287765e7180cc81dcf1768a1d798d2dd8552ec7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1610/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1610/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1610/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/93591f056dafca5f910f8ae679820793561a5fd1","head":{"label":"mercyblitz:master","ref":"master","sha":"93591f056dafca5f910f8ae679820793561a5fd1","user":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96880522,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5Njg4MDUyMg==","name":"dubbo","full_name":"mercyblitz/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz/dubbo","description":":loudspeaker:

passed.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-04-11T08:55:35Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T08:09:07Z","closed_at":"2018-04-20T07:48:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f71f32c3433d2890d400864dccf1d49042e568d8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1589/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1589/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1589/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cbb4fb71030fdd225f09bc560af6a1da47019a46","head":{"label":"hengyunabc:master","ref":"master","sha":"cbb4fb71030fdd225f09bc560af6a1da47019a46","user":{"login":"hengyunabc","id":1683936,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2ODM5MzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1683936?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc","html_url":"https://github.com/hengyunabc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hengyunabc/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1de21470c95c9bf3724b39b79a0cc53eeb0594ce","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

[Enhancement] Add configuration properties of binder for Dubbo's config beans #1464\r\n* [Enhancement] Dubbo Config Bindings supports customized DataBinder #1278\r\n* [Refactor] ReferenceAnnotationBeanPostProcessor add Ops methods #1277\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun test-cases\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-30T08:26:04Z","updated_at":"2018-04-03T13:36:58Z","closed_at":"2018-03-30T08:27:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f753e993985ee7d022feea5a45fcc276b4a0d3b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1531/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1531/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1531/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/9deadadea3b1342345fed77c87a3d24ea026d7e6","head":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9deadadea3b1342345fed77c87a3d24ea026d7e6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-30T02:29:25Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T15:53:32Z","closed_at":"2018-03-30T05:16:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"59862e9f598a59c9e1a9c0efb6592eae1f63b423","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1526/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1526/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1526/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4f3454002414f19ee07664c731a02aa30c4d8b27","head":{"label":"apache:2.5.x","ref":"2.5.x","sha":"4f3454002414f19ee07664c731a02aa30c4d8b27","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. update pom.xml license\r\n2. update scm, mailLists, issueManagement, organization\r\n3. add DISCLAIMER\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll unit tests are pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUpdate pom for into apache incubator, partial fix for this issue: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/DUBBO/issues/DUBBO-7?filter=allopenissues\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. update pom.xml license\r\n2. update scm, mailLists, issueManagement, organization\r\n3. add DISCLAIMER\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAll unit tests are pass\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-15T09:55:15Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:26Z","closed_at":"2018-03-15T10:00:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7d116950e657214719b4e3d0e0bf742c39c78d4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1b87538071b4f84e4b30155787629a83641d90d4","head":{"label":"1142763824:1142763824-patch-1","ref":"1142763824-patch-1","sha":"1b87538071b4f84e4b30155787629a83641d90d4","user":{"login":"1142763824","id":4608334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDgzMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4608334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824","html_url":"https://github.com/1142763824","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":125342737,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjUzNDI3Mzc=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"1142763824/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"1142763824","id":4608334,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDgzMzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4608334?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824","html_url":"https://github.com/1142763824","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1142763824/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/1142763824/dubbo","description":"Dubbo

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

will be dispatched to thread pool.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRestore the bug that attachment has not been updated in the RpcContext when the Dubbo built-in retry mechanism is triggered.\r\n\r\nWe found that when Dubbo through Filter to Provider traceId and spanId (transfer access to distributed tracking parameters used by the system), when the trigger Consumer Dubbo retry mechanism, Provider (response but at the Consumer end of overtime) the data is always the first call to traceId and spanId (Consumer in retry timeout the RpcContext.getContext (.SetAttachment) (String key, String value) set up a new traceId and spanId did not pass in the past).\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nRestore the bug that attachment has not been updated in the RpcContext when the Dubbo built-in retry mechanism is triggered\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWhen modified, when the Dubbo retry mechanism is triggered, the new RpcContext attachments can be passed to Provider as desired.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-09T17:32:15Z","updated_at":"2018-03-19T14:10:25Z","closed_at":"2018-03-11T02:13:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"64f36e0013de7daa4c43d39c2baaad5ab03c9d3e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1445/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1445/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1445/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fb56e56fd87b0586d159e4eb748aca7caff47f65","head":{"label":"manzhizhen:attachment-not-update","ref":"attachment-not-update","sha":"fb56e56fd87b0586d159e4eb748aca7caff47f65","user":{"login":"manzhizhen","id":6687462,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2ODc0NjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6687462?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen","html_url":"https://github.com/manzhizhen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/manzhizhen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1f22f560a44995340daa3039b29eee72a3ea504f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport unit router feature for dubbo.\r\n\r\nWhat problems can this feature solve?\r\n\r\ncase 1:\r\n  If we have two instance of services or more, we call it serviceA(192.168.0.1), serviceA(192.168.0.2)\r\n \r\n ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15549777/37189200-08a40706-238e-11e8-9802-4dc38676c08d.png)\r\n\r\nWe want to invoke serviceA (192.168.0.2) first, if serviceA (192.168.0.2) is not available then invoke  serviceA (192.168.0.1) automatically.\r\n\r\ncase 2:\r\n\r\nIf we have many relative services, We call it serviceA(192.168.0.1), serviceA(192.168.0.2), serviceB(192.168.1.1), serviceB(192.168.1.2), serviceC(192.168.3.1), serviceC(192.168.3.2)\r\n\r\ndependencies of service: \r\nserviceA -> serviceB -> serviceC\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15549777/37189624-54607bfa-2390-11e8-9071-9820d6a0ce5d.png)\r\n\r\nWe can flexibly build call paths and automatically downgrade calls.\r\n\r\ncase 3:\r\n\r\nWe can take advantage of this feature to realize the priority routing of the same machine room service.\r\n \r\nNotes:\r\n\r\nif use unit feature, unit router will be last invoked, \r\nbecause if the unit router has no match, it will return the previous available invokers, this is very important !\r\n\r\nEasy to use:\r\n\r\n Set service and reference are same unit value. or use global configuration.\r\n case 1：\r\n consumer.xml:  `<dubbo:reference id=\"XXX\" check=\"false\" interface=\"XXX\" unit=\"anything\"/>`\r\n provider.xml:     `<dubbo:service interface=\"XXX\" ref=\"bean\" unit=\"same as reference\"/>`\r\n\r\n case 2：(global)\r\n consumer.xml & provider.xml : `<dubbo:provider unit=\"anything\"/>`， \"anything\"  suggest same both side.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. add unit property for dubbo.xsd\r\n2. add new UnitRouter and so on\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nHere is more detail unit tests:\r\n1. com.alibaba.dubbo.rpc.cluster.router.unit.UnitRouterTest\r\n2. com.alibaba.dubbo.registry.dubbo.RegistryDirectoryTest\r\n\r\nI have verified that the unit test has been correct and passed.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-07T03:38:13Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T10:11:19Z","closed_at":"2018-03-09T03:44:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ecbca042ff441f90ef7b37f65f30c99bc2b3aba4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1425/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/1425/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/1425/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/09029647fa60ff92998cdf5454043d6e7fae3f57","head":{"label":"jsjchai:master","ref":"master","sha":"09029647fa60ff92998cdf5454043d6e7fae3f57","user":{"login":"jsjchai","id":13389058,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzg5MDU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13389058?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai","html_url":"https://github.com/jsjchai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsjchai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4a5c5e200d2d41ab01f22b1c5ff7796a7241325f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nResolve #1322.  We can run `maven deploy` in root directory and deploy all sub modules of dubbo project to central repository:\r\n \r\n1. dubbo.jar. all in one jar, same as before.\r\n2. dubbo-xxx.jar. a packaged jar for every sub module.\r\n\r\nMore details please check discussion in #1322.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. extract serialization module from `dubbo-common`.\r\n2. change module name `dubbo-rpc-default` to `dubbo-rpc-dubbo`.\r\n3. change 'skip_maven_deploy' to false, so all modules can be deployed to central repository.\r\n4. upgrade hessian-lite version to 3.2.2.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n1. run `mvn deploy` and see if dubbo project can be deployed to repository as expected.\r\n2. check `dubbo.jar` and every `separated jar` works fine in a simple demo.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/alibaba/dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
