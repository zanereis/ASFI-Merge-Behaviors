*remove getVolcanoPlanner method from FlinkOptimizeContext.\r\nVolcanoPlanner limits that the planer a RelNode tree belongs to and the VolcanoPlanner used to optimize the RelNode tree should be same instance. (see: VolcanoPlanner#registerImpl)\r\nso, we can use planner instance in RelNode's cluster directly instead of planner from getVolcanoPlanner method in FlinkOptimizeContext.*\r\n  - *RelNodeBlock does not depend on TableEnvironment*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nInspired by the idea of [FLINK-11458](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11458), we propose to support terminate/suspend a job with checkpoint. This improvement cooperates with incremental and external checkpoint features, that if checkpoint is retained and this feature is configured, we will trigger a checkpoint before the job stops. It could accelarate job recovery a lot since:\r\n1. No source rewinding required any more.\r\n2. It's much faster than taking a savepoint since incremental checkpoint is enabled.\r\n\r\nPlease note that conceptually savepoints is different from checkpoint in a similar way that backups are different from recovery logs in traditional database systems. So we suggest using this feature only for job recovery, while stick with FLINK-11458 for the upgrading/cross-cluster-job-migration/state-backend-switch cases.\r\n\r\nThe current commit does not include rest API(will do this by follow up issue  [FLINK-12733](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-12733).\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - CliFrontendStopTest.java#{stopWithCheckpoint, testStopWithCheckpointWithMaxWM, testStopWithCheckpointAndSavepoint}\r\n  - CheckpointPropertiesTest.java#testSyncCheckpoint\r\n  - CheckpointTypeTest.java #testOrdinalsAreConstant\r\n  - PendingCheckpointTest.java #testSyncCheckpointCannotBeSubsumed\r\n  - CheckpointSerializationTest.java \r\n  - EventSerializerTest.java #testIsEvent\r\n  - SynchronousCheckpointITCase.java\r\n  - SynchronousCheckpointTest.java\r\n \r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (JavaDocs)\r\n@aljoscha @StefanRRichter

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is the initial PR for FLIP-43 adding the functionality to read non-partitioned operator state from a state snapshot. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n- The first two commits expose internal api's for use outside of their package but mark them for internal use only. \r\n- The third commit adds the operator state reader functionality \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- Unit and IT tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (**yes** / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n    (Full documentation coming in the keyed state reader PR)","created_at":"2019-06-04T13:36:35Z","updated_at":"2019-06-26T03:35:13Z","closed_at":"2019-06-26T03:35:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cfccf428564a6c7ae85141294662207a338ee177","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244456213,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU2MjEz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=architecture?","name":"review=architecture?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/dceecbb7a6c0c9d77960d1772f1213e1fc80eba7","head":{"label":"sjwiesman:FLINK-12729","ref":"FLINK-12729","sha":"dceecbb7a6c0c9d77960d1772f1213e1fc80eba7","user":{"login":"sjwiesman","id":1891970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTE5NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1891970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman","html_url":"https://github.com/sjwiesman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":83625968,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4MzYyNTk2OA==","name":"flink","full_name":"sjwiesman/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sjwiesman","id":1891970,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4OTE5NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1891970?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman","html_url":"https://github.com/sjwiesman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sjwiesman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sjwiesman/flink","description":"Mirror

tables\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo support writing (both static and dynamic) partitioned table in `HiveTableOutputFormat`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Create partition writer based on the partition values in each record HiveTableOutputFormat processes\r\n  - After the job is done, move data to proper partition location. For dynamic partitioning, partition discovery is needed to find all partitions generated.\r\n  - If a partition doesn't already exist, create it in Hive metastore.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nWill add unit test later.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? docs\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-04T12:53:16Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T02:13:32Z","closed_at":"2019-06-12T18:08:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b61f63d98716f3664d7b6ca2630c93fa632b86d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8614/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8614/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8614/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5ee7cb607c5002bfeec7329e9ebcbfcee69bbc09","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-12727","ref":"FLINK-12727","sha":"5ee7cb607c5002bfeec7329e9ebcbfcee69bbc09","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThere are two implementations for BitSet in flink-runtime ocmponent: one is org.apache.flink.runtime.operators.util.BloomFilter#BitSet, while the other is org.apache.flink.runtime.operators.util.BitSet\r\n\r\nThe two classes are quite similar in their API and implementations. The only difference is that, the former is based based on long operation while the latter is based on byte operation. This has the following consequence:\r\n\r\nThe byte based BitSet has better performance for get/set operations.\r\nThe long based BitSet has better performance for the clear operation.\r\nWe combine the two implementations and make the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Remove the BitSet class in org.apache.flink.runtime.operators.util.BloomFilter\r\n  - Revise class org.apache.flink.runtime.operators.util.BitSet for better performance\r\n  \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(BloomFilterTest)*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-04T12:47:50Z","updated_at":"2019-07-22T09:39:41Z","closed_at":"2019-07-09T11:08:08Z","merged_at":"2019-07-09T11:08:08Z","merge_commit_sha":"14c4b23ca8744f83864a8c91ff0c1b88af52e532","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8613/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8613/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8613/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1a021b1130ef301b10e31ad32f375d17863837bb","head":{"label":"liyafan82:fly_0604_bitset","ref":"fly_0604_bitset","sha":"1a021b1130ef301b10e31ad32f375d17863837bb","user":{"login":"liyafan82","id":42827532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3NTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42827532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82","html_url":"https://github.com/liyafan82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":167302115,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjczMDIxMTU=","name":"flink","full_name":"liyafan82/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liyafan82","id":42827532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3NTMy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42827532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82","html_url":"https://github.com/liyafan82","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liyafan82/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liyafan82/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nExtract the customized hash-map out of `CopyOnWriteStateTable`, and store state in such hash-map by key-group as same as `NestedMapsStateTable`. After that, `CopyOnWriteStateTable` and `NestedMapsStateTable` will have some common logic both for state access and snapshot, so we refactor the code to dismiss the duplication.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - Introduce `StateMap` which stores state in a key-group. The implementation includes `NestedStateMap` and `CopyOnWriteStateMap`.  `NestedStateMap` uses a nested map which provides an outer scope by namespace and an inner scope by key; `CopyOnWriteStateMap` is a customized hash-map extracted from the original `CopyOnWriteStateTable`.\r\n - `NestedMapsStateTable` stores state into different `NestedStateMap`s by key-group\r\n - `CopyOnWriteStateTable` stores state into different `CopyOnWriteStateMap`s by key-group\r\n - Introduce `StateMapSnapshot` which is a snapshot of `StateMap`\r\n - Refactor `StateTable` and `AbstractStateTableSnapshot` to dismiss the duplicated code for the nested and copy-on-write tables\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo fix hive-1.2.1 build. The build was broken because some util method used in FLINK-12568 is not compatible in Hive-2.3.4 and Hive-1.2.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added shim for `FileUtils.moveToTrash`.\r\n  - Added test to cover it.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded new test and tested for both 2.3.4 and 1.2.1 (manually).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? NA\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-04T09:12:13Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T03:13:50Z","closed_at":"2019-06-06T17:27:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1afb7dfd43edcaa60a1260244425af5599f52ed4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8610/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8610/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8610/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/831d1b4f897f5044cd950fc372c734267d9e1fa5","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-12715","ref":"FLINK-12715","sha":"831d1b4f897f5044cd950fc372c734267d9e1fa5","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nExtract `ShuffleEnvironment` interface from `NetworkEnvironment`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add page size config also to `TaskManagerServicesConfiguration` because this general option is also used for `MemoryManager` independently from `NetworkEnvironment`. Any other `ShuffleEnvironment` can potentially use its own page size.\r\n- Extract `ShuffleEnvironment` interface from `NetworkEnvironment` with its public methods.\r\n- Make `NetworkEnvironment` its default implementation\r\n- Rename `NetworkEnvironment﻿﻿` to `﻿NettyShuffleEnvironment`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRefactoring covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add getVertexOrThrow and getResultPartitionOrThrow in SchedulingTopology to simplify code structure.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add getVertexOrThrow and getResultPartitionOrThrow in SchedulingTopology.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added unit tests in ExecutionGraphToSchedulingTopologyAdapterTest. \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-04T02:11:16Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T06:40:00Z","closed_at":"2019-06-13T19:13:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"80ad9a3f7678458b4139567e201a51a5706e87ef","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8603/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8603/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8603/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9ddb4a7de5d42657e3345b44c9e2b357b33fba7a","head":{"label":"eaglewatcherwb:FLINK-12608-topology-interface","ref":"FLINK-12608-topology-interface","sha":"9ddb4a7de5d42657e3345b44c9e2b357b33fba7a","user":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163267123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMyNjcxMjM=","name":"flink","full_name":"eaglewatcherwb/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe `SynchronousCheckpointITCase` has a race condition and with some chance may fail on random tests on CI. This PR adds an additional synchronization point as a workaround to avoid the issue.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the PR simplifies (refactors) the test, although the race condition is present in both refactored and non-refactored versions.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - The test is simplified to not use dedicated locks for general flow checks. The test run set to limited by a timeout.\r\n  - Added a hacky synchronization point in `advanceToEndOfEventTime` method, to make sure that `triggerCheckpoint` thread has progressed far enough, before triggering `notifyCheckpointComplete`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T20:54:17Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T07:07:26Z","closed_at":"2019-06-14T06:33:57Z","merged_at":"2019-06-14T06:33:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"c539333e748324f2196f7a266f0bbf1e6b797c52","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"StefanRRichter","id":2128543,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMjg1NDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2128543?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter","html_url":"https://github.com/StefanRRichter","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/StefanRRichter/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8602/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8602/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8602/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9d0ce4d02646327961446a13f5d3f25169f212a5","head":{"label":"1u0:flink-12313-workaround-to-avoid-race-in-test","ref":"flink-12313-workaround-to-avoid-race-in-test","sha":"9d0ce4d02646327961446a13f5d3f25169f212a5","user":{"login":"1u0","id":488251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODI1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/488251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0","html_url":"https://github.com/1u0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":155554452,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTU1NTQ0NTI=","name":"flink","full_name":"1u0/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"1u0","id":488251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODI1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/488251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0","html_url":"https://github.com/1u0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/1u0/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T13:50:12Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T13:51:02Z","closed_at":"2019-06-03T13:51:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b75f6087cef1f7db81562ea0b4724314b9299837","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8598/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8598/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8598/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/cacf3a10d7b3f27431d6bd746b35295c6e9cf310","head":{"label":"hakeedra:master","ref":"master","sha":"cacf3a10d7b3f27431d6bd746b35295c6e9cf310","user":{"login":"hakeedra","id":26460056,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NDYwMDU2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26460056?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra","html_url":"https://github.com/hakeedra","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hakeedra/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"de31f49b4b835b71cdf99f93c89e33a84113b272","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request completes the Chinese translation of \"Task Lifecycle\" from official documents.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\ntranslates internal document \"Task Lifecycle\" into Chinese\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is to add a new translated document.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-06-03T12:32:43Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T08:19:18Z","closed_at":"2019-06-05T08:19:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"caa850eb7930e7522bed599d3884b3ecdfb504bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278841078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODQxMDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=chinese-translation","name":"component=chinese-translation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8597/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8597/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8597/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/309a1efb6842b3987eda12bf59dd68052ba1a60d","head":{"label":"Armstrongya:zxx-trans-task-lifecycle-v2","ref":"zxx-trans-task-lifecycle-v2","sha":"309a1efb6842b3987eda12bf59dd68052ba1a60d","user":{"login":"Armstrongya","id":5070956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzA5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5070956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya","html_url":"https://github.com/Armstrongya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":183427086,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODM0MjcwODY=","name":"flink","full_name":"Armstrongya/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Armstrongya","id":5070956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzA5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5070956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya","html_url":"https://github.com/Armstrongya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Armstrongya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Armstrongya/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request completes the Chinese translation of \"Task Lifecycle\" from official documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\ntranslates internal document \"Task Lifecycle\" into Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is to add a new translated document.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds descriptor, validator, and factory for HiveCatalog, and tests  in flink-sql-client.\r\n\r\nDesign doc can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ALxfiGZBaZ8KUNJtoT443hReoPoJEdt9Db2wiJ2LuWA/edit).\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- added descriptor, validator, and factory for HiveCatalog\r\n- added unit tests in both flink-connector-hive and flnk-sql-client. Factory discovery service tests in flink-sql-client uses`TestHiveCatalog` and `TestHiveCatalogFactory`, and these classes are mostly exactly the same with `HiveCatalog` and `HiveCatalogFactory` except a few minimal differences for testing purpose\r\n- fixed dependency convergence issues found when adding hive test dependencies to flink-sql-client by excluding conflicted libs\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- added `HiveCatalogDescriptorTest` and `HiveCatalogFactoryTest` in flink-connector-hive\r\n- added `TestHiveCatalog` and `TestHiveCatalogFactory`in flink-sql-client along with hive catalog entries in test-sql-client-catalogs.yaml for test factory discovery.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes )\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Provide a new algorithm Summarizer(summary statistics for Table). User can easily get the total count and the basic column-wise metrics: max, min, mean, variance, standardDeviation, normL1, normL2, the number of missing values and the number of valid values.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Implementation of algorithm Summarizer.*\r\n  - *Base definition for the algorithm params.*\r\n  - *Definition and operations for sparse/dense matrix and vector.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(no)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(no)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added tests for the algorithm Summarizer*\r\n  - *Added tests for DenseVector and SparseVector*\r\n  - *Added tests for DenseMatrix*\r\n  - *Added tests for summary computation process*\r\n  - *Added tests for SummarizerBatchOp*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n      *

commit moves the `StreamTransformation` from flink-streaming to flink-core. This is necessary so that we do not add dependency on flink-streaming to flink-table-api\r\n  - Added `Planner` interface that defines methods to parse sql statements and convert relational `TableOperation` program to `StreamTransformations`\r\n  - Introduced ModiyTableOperations which definy a way to exit the Table ecosystem. This way we can provide either `TableSink` to emit to or the expected type information of the produced `StreamTransformations`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change introduces only new interface that are not used yet, therefore no tests are added.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no /** don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

This is necessary so that we do not add dependency on flink-streaming to flink-table-api\r\n  - Added `Planner` interface that defines methods to parse sql statements and convert relational `TableOperation` program to `StreamTransformations`\r\n  - Introduced ModiyTableOperations which definy a way to exit the Table ecosystem. This way we can provide either `TableSink` to emit to or the expected type information of the produced `StreamTransformations`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change introduces only new interface that are not used yet, therefore no tests are added.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no /** don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-31T10:07:05Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T06:40:12Z","closed_at":"2019-05-31T10:07:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5e86eb34220d37649a73f1315fb1bde076603bd6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8584/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8584/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8584/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/9a035d77a52a6ffb498bc65d9473a4b2afbaaf48","head":{"label":"dawidwys:planner-interface","ref":"planner-interface","sha":"9a035d77a52a6ffb498bc65d9473a4b2afbaaf48","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43764900,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mzc2NDkwMA==","name":"flink","full_name":"dawidwys/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove the performance and code structure for org.apache.flink.table.runtime.util.collections.ByteHashSet.\r\n\r\nSince there are only 256 possible byte values, the largest possible range is 255, and the condition \r\n\r\nrange < OptimizableHashSet.DENSE_THRESHOLD\r\n\r\nmust be satisfied. So ByteHashSet must be in dense mode.\r\n\r\nWe can make use of this to improve the performance and code structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Change the code so it only considers the case for dense mode.\r\n  \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not

order to support Blink batch and temporal table join, we need some new source&sink interfaces and changes about TableSchema.\r\n\r\n- `AsyncTableFunction`:  used as async lookup function, to support async temporal table join (i.e. dimension table join.).\r\n- `LookupableTableSource`: The `LookupableTableSource` interface adds support for the table to be accessed via key column(s) in a lookup fashion in order to support temporal table join. \r\n- `BoundedTableSource`: used for batch table source, returns a bounded DataStream, not a `InputFormat`, because we also want to reuse existing streaming source implementation to support bounded source, for example: bounded Kafka source.\r\n- `BoundedTableSink`: used for batch table sink, emit a bounded DataStream, not a `OutputFormat`. The reason is the same as above.\r\n- `TableSchema`: The `TableSchema` is extended to carry more information about primary key and unique keys. The key information will be used in optimization.","created_at":"2019-05-30T13:35:30Z","updated_at":"2019-05-30T13:44:04Z","closed_at":"2019-05-30T13:44:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f992c076b04fe2acecda68c90aee1064b52777f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8576/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8576/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8576/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/1dacb23e085538802be542f9541bf4d6c53d0863","head":{"label":"wuchong:source-sink","ref":"source-sink","sha":"1dacb23e085538802be542f9541bf4d6c53d0863","user":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63797485,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2Mzc5NzQ4NQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"wuchong/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuchong","id":5378924,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNzg5MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5378924?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong","html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuchong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuchong/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe result partition metrics are initialised before `ResultPartitiion#setup` was called. If a reporter tries to access a In/OutputBufferPoolUsageGauge in between it will fail with an `NullPointerException` since the `BufferPool` of the partition is still `null`. Currently, the quick fix is to return zero metrics until the `BufferPool` is initialised. When we have a single-threaded access from `Task#run`, we can merge partition/gate create and setup then it should not be the case anymore.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nCheck the partition `BufferPool` is not `null` in `In/OutputBufferPoolUsageGauge#getValue` and return zero metrics if it is `null`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nTrivial fix.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Implement FailureRateRestartBackoffTimeStrategy*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Implement FailureRateRestartBackoffTimeStrategy*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added unit tests in FailureRateRestartBackoffTimeStrategyTest*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-30T09:50:07Z","updated_at":"2019-06-14T07:40:51Z","closed_at":"2019-06-14T07:22:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"25b56efc94d457b6a4286e900ab6b6460014d542","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8573/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8573/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8573/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/45ddafd6cba58864dd9293be72424f937b379f35","head":{"label":"eaglewatcherwb:FLINK-12670-failure-rate-strategy","ref":"FLINK-12670-failure-rate-strategy","sha":"45ddafd6cba58864dd9293be72424f937b379f35","user":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163267123,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjMyNjcxMjM=","name":"flink","full_name":"eaglewatcherwb/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eaglewatcherwb","id":42056379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyMDU2Mzc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42056379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb","html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eaglewatcherwb/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eaglewatcherwb/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at making the lazy initialization of `StateDescriptor.serializer` thread safe, more details about what problem there will be w/o the fix please refer to [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-11987).\r\n\r\nThis PR supersedes [PR#8331](https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/8331) as per discussed there.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nChanges mainly inlcude:\r\n* Use CAS when lazily initializing `serializer` in `StateDescriptor#initializeSerializerUnlessSet`, to make sure only one serializer will be used.\r\n* Remove the nullify of `typeInfo` in `StateDescriptor#initializeSerializerUnlessSet` to prevent NPE as observed in `FlinkKafkaProducer011` from jira description.\r\n* Added a new UT case in `StateDescriptorTest` to reproduce the problem and verify the fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded a `testSerializerLazyInitializeInParallel` test case in `StateDescriptorTest` for verification.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n     - `StateDescriptor` is annotated with `@PublicEvolving` while changes here don't involve any modification on method/interface signatures.\r\n  - The serializers: (yes)\r\n     - The change here assures only one single serializer instance will be wrapped after lazy initialization while previously no such assurance.\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-30T08:10:49Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T14:16:09Z","closed_at":"2019-06-01T07:40:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb208fe21a3a7a9a7dde1e7f22c750354f67eb74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244467905,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDY3OTA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=approved%20%E2%9C%85","name":"review=approved

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request add metrics to the Elasticsearch connectors, to make it easier to operate and monitor in a production environment.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe following metrics have been added:\r\n - ItemRequest success count (counter)\r\n - ItemRequest failure count (counter) grouped by error type.\r\n - BulkRequest failure count (counter) grouped by error type.\r\n - BulkRequest latency (gauge)\r\n\r\n<b> Note: </b>Gauge doesn't feel like the right metric type for measuring bulkRequest latency, as it will only capture the last requestLatency before the gauge gets polled. Flink metric system currently lacks a timer type that can be used to capture event latencies in a richer way. I opened FLINK-12680 to track addition of a timer type.\r\nAnother metric-related thing we noticed during internal reviews is that the SimpleCounter is not thread safe, which makes it somewhat risky/expensive to use it in a multithreaded context. I opened FLINK-12681 to track making SimpleCounter thread-safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage. Also manually verified the metrics by hooking with our internal time-series system.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n##

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds descriptor, validator, and factory of GenericInMemoryCatalog, and enables SQL CLI to load a generic in memory catalog thru yaml config and table discovery service.\r\n\r\nIt contains 3 parts:\r\n\r\n- commit a754fce8cc91787cf9225a3be166962c4ebafde6 Support 'default-database' config for catalog entries in SQL CLI yaml file\r\n- commit 45742158839b86dda2e0c93a172d9c50b4aae6e2 Add AbstractCatalog to manage the common catalog name and default database name for catalogs\r\n- commit 4c37d371467b54514f91785497af1e3a8b7102c7 Add descriptor, validator, and factory of GenericInMemoryCatalog for table discovery service\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added an optional 'default-database' config for catalog entries in SQL CLI yaml file\r\n- Added AbstractCatalog to manage the common catalog name and default database name for catalogs to manage common parts of catalog impls and facilitate comparing catalogs in catalog factory tests\r\n- Developed descriptor, validator, and factory of GenericInMemoryCatalog for table discovery service\r\n- Wrote unit tests for descriptor, validator, and factory of GenericInMemoryCatalog\r\n\r\nDescriptor, validator, factory, and unit tests are built by referencing existing classes.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo add shim layer for HMS client, in order to support different versions of HMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added interface `HiveShim` to define methods that need shimming.\r\n  - Implemented `HiveShimV1` and `HiveShimV2` for 1.x and 2.x respectively.\r\n  - Added `HiveShimLoader` to automatically load HiveShim.\r\n  - Added `HiveMetastoreClientWrapper` as a wrapper of `IMetaStoreClient`, and it calls `HiveShim` for APIs that need shimming.\r\n  - Added a maven profile `hive-1` that overrides the version of Hive deps. This profile can be used to build and test against Hive-1.2.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nManually built and tested with `hive-1` profile.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? JavaDocs for now. Need more formal docs when this feature is merged or released.\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-29T10:37:34Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T02:26:25Z","closed_at":"2019-05-31T18:23:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1af36b74cb7c4fa83528553a719391aaba0ab146","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8564/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8564/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8564/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/53219c63fea36a8e21bcf61c6d3282967a91c31e","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-12649","ref":"FLINK-12649","sha":"53219c63fea36a8e21bcf61c6d3282967a91c31e","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\nI find a shell issue in `verify_scala_suffixes.sh`(line 145) as follows:\r\n\r\n`grep \"${module}_\\d\\+\\.\\d\\+</artifactId>\" \"{}\"`\r\n\r\nThis code want to find out all modules that the module's `artifactId`  with a `scala_binary_version` suffix. \r\nbut the problem is our all `artifactId` value is in the pattern of `XXX_${scala.binary.version}`, such as:\r\n\r\n`<artifactId>flink-tests_${scala.binary.version}</artifactId>`\r\n\r\nthen the result always empty, so this check did not take effect.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to correct `artifactId `of some of the modules and correct the check logic for scala-free.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - remove the scala version suffix for connector-hive and queryable-state-client-java\r\n  - add the scala dependencies for table-api-scala and flink-sql-connectors\r\n  - correct the scala-free check logic in `verify_scala_suffixes.sh`\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nWe have two ways handling of the connector:\r\n 1. Improve the script to check any (compile) dependencies with a scala-suffix(which we mentioned above).\r\n 2. Add the `flink-streaming-java` dependency wich  `provided`  scope for the corresponding connectors.\r\n\r\nFor approach 1, we should add check logic:\r\n 1. The command of `dependency:tree` should add an option: ` -Dincludes=org.apache.flink:_2.1::  ` such as `org.apache.flink:flink-streaming-java_2.11`.\r\n  2. The command of `grep ` also need to add the logic: `E \"org.scala-lang| org.apache.flink:[^:]+_2\\.1[0-9]\"` , also for test `grep --invert-match \"org.apache.flink:[^:]_2\\.1[0-9]:.:.*:test\"`.\r\n\r\nFor approach 2, we should add the dependency of `link-streaming-java` for `flink-sql-connector-elasticsearch6 flink-sql-connector-kafka flink-sql-connector-kafka-0.10 flink-sql-connector-kafka-0.11 flink-sql-connector-kafka-0.9`.  \r\n\r\nFor now, I think the change logic in approach 1 is a bit complex(a lot of filtering processing logic). So, I prefer the approach 2, due to even we add some new module in the future we should well know whether we should add the scala-suffix for the `artifactId`, then manually add dependencies on for the scala in the pom. \r\n\r\nSo, in this PR I add the dependency of `link-streaming-java` for `flink-sql-connectors`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (docs)\r\n    1. correct the artifactId in `queryable_state.md/queryable_state.zh.md`.\r\n

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request is intended to add TableSchema for Python Table API. For this goal, a `_to_python_type` function is introduced in this pull request. This function is for converting Java's DataType and TypeInformation objects into Python's DataType objects. For ensuring that `_to_python_type` and the existing `_to_java_type` are mutually inverse functions, this PR makes some changes on the flink python type system.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add the `TableSchema` class.*\r\n  - *Add `get_schema` method in `Table` class.*\r\n  - *Add `schema` method in `OldCsv` and `Schema` class.*\r\n  - *Add `_to_python_type` function.*\r\n  - *Changed many default value and default behavior of current data types.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded integration tests in `test_table_schema.py`, `test_schema_operation.py` and `test_types.py`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (python docs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-29T07:25:55Z","updated_at":"2019-06-09T20:30:31Z","closed_at":"2019-06-09T20:30:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c689c3c1ffdc4ad6a0f873bdd100e55e565cb10","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8d993b0f6d2cff552cd50472f51f32c595c2aeb6","head":{"label":"WeiZhong94:FLINK-12588","ref":"FLINK-12588","sha":"8d993b0f6d2cff552cd50472f51f32c595c2aeb6","user":{"login":"WeiZhong94","id":44194288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk0Mjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44194288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94","html_url":"https://github.com/WeiZhong94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157821394,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc4MjEzOTQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"WeiZhong94/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"WeiZhong94","id":44194288,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTk0Mjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44194288?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94","html_url":"https://github.com/WeiZhong94","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/WeiZhong94/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/WeiZhong94/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes the bug that limits the network buffer size with the heap size on the TM side. In fact, network buffer occupies a part of direct memory and is independent with the heap.\r\n\r\nTo fix this problem, The limitation on the TM side is removed. Although we may want to compare the network memory size with the total memory size on the TM side, currently we can only compute the total memory with heap + computed network memory and the computed total memory should be always larger than the computed network memory.\r\n\r\nTo remove the limitation, the max allowed memory used to check the network memory size on TM side is changed to Long.MAX_VALUE. Another option is to move the checking to the caller function on the RM side. however, it is not easy to achieve since the checking relies on the configured values of MIN and MAX, and it is not accessible outside of the current function.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - f32dde51c1183d22e8a192e19d037a4f0c48c9ae extracts common variables to simplify the tests.\r\n  - 17f93e19b39433dc5d93c24c5b8a85feb1c37b1f fixes the exception when network buffer fraction is larger than 0.5 on TM side, and adds new tests to cover the cases that the network buffer fraction is larger than 0.5\r\n - 2762ce8f219b8b988d9824a8beab5c6117119403 optimizes the computation of the network memory on TM side to fix the numerical precision problem.\r\n - aa5c15913e411babe2bf5cc3067cdbb112d57fd0 unifies the terminology in `NettyShuffleEnvironmentConfiguration`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Add tests for network buffer computation with `fraction > 0.5`*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a cluster with two task managers for both standalone and YARN mode, and test the configuration with heap = 3G/network = 2G and heap = 5G/network = 2G*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR contains another set of utility classes for enabling the new type system. The most important part is the ValueDataTypeConverter. It basically allows converting literals to DataType. By looking into the actual value instead of just the class, it enabled supporting all sorts of time classes as well as Java's BigDecimal with variable precision and scale.\r\n\r\nIt also contains one important change regarding string literals that improve SQL standard compliance.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee commit messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nSee `ValueDataTypeConverterTest`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo set input/output formats and SerDe lib when creating Hive tables in HiveCatalog, so that we can access these tables later.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Sets input/output formats and SerDe according to a storage format. Currently this storage format is hard coded as text file format. And we'll make this configurable in follow up task.\r\n  - Promoted hive-exec dependency to compile scope, and updated NOTICE file accordingly.\r\n  - Added a test to verify tables created by HiveCatalog have input/output format and SerDe lib properly set.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNew test case in `HiveCatalogHiveMetadataTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? NA\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-27T11:23:22Z","updated_at":"2019-05-29T02:12:17Z","closed_at":"2019-05-28T17:07:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"07d625f5d181a4c24afebb7bb6eac944e8784d2e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8553/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8553/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8553/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4436b4390981bc6a7483b77931ee6ba8e3f40b70","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-12418","ref":"FLINK-12418","sha":"4436b4390981bc6a7483b77931ee6ba8e3f40b70","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*`InputGate` is currently defined as an abstract class which implements the logic of checking data availability for subclasses `SingleInputGate` and `UnionInputGate`, but it might bring limits for further extending `InputGate` implementations in shuffle service architecture. So we refactor the `InputGate` as a general interface and define a new isAvailable method for it. The existing implementation of data availability is extracted as a separate class which could still be used for both single and union gates as now. The future new `InputGate` instances from other shuffle services might have different implementations for data availability.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Refactor `InputGate` as interface and define `isAvailable` for it.*\r\n  - *Extract the data available implementation as separate class `FutureBasedDataAvailability`*\r\n  - *Extract `InputWithData` as a separate class*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*covered by existing tests.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request supports incremental emit under AccRetract mode for non-window streaming FlatAggregate on Table API\r\n\r\nAs described in [Flip-29](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=97552739), there are two output modes for non-window streaming flatAggregate. One is emitting with full values, the other is emitting with incremental values. [FLINK-10977](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10977) supports the former one, this jira is going to support the latter one under AccRetract mode. The reason that Acc mode has not been converted by this jira is that we can't define keys on TableAggregateFunction. Once we support define keys on the output of flatAggregate, we can support the AccMode. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThere are four commits for this PR:\r\n  - 3a39d63 adds the RetractableCollector. The collector collects a record and forwards it. The collector can output retract messages with the retract. The collector only use it in `emitRetractValueIncrementally`.\r\n  - 03019de adjusts the codgen part. It takes the `emitRetractValueIncrementally` method into consideration and also generates the retract methods if it is a Retractable collector.\r\n  - 611a02c This is the runtime function part. Minor changes in this part. The big difference is retractions will be generated by TableAggregateFunction manually if incremental emit value methods have been defined.\r\n  - a9921d5 Adjusts documents about `emitRetractValueIncrementally`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - Add `testEmitRetractValueIncrementally()` ITCase to test the incremental emit.\r\n  - Add `testTableAggregateEmitRetractValueIncrementally()` harness test to test the incremental emit.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (docs)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-27T07:23:32Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T12:15:42Z","closed_at":"2019-06-12T09:49:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"aa3c77110c803ba13ac33c6f61749249819a2ddf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"twalthr","id":5746567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDY1Njc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5746567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr","html_url":"https://github.com/twalthr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/twalthr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244467905,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDY3OTA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=approved%20%E2%9C%85","name":"review=approved

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is next step in decoupling `TableEnvironment` from Calcite. It introduces registration of `TableSource/Sink` as `CatalogTable`s.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThis is based on #8521.\r\n\r\n  - added `org.apache.flink.table.catalog.ConnectorCatalogTable` that wraps `TableSource/Sink` and used it for registration in `TableEnvironment`\r\n  - added `org.apache.flink.table.operations.TableSourceTableOperation` for reading from an inline `TableSource`. This is used only when creating a `Table` from `TableEnvironment#fromTableSource` \r\n  - removed unnecessary code duplication from classes such as `TableSourceSinkTable`, `TableSourceTable`, `TableSinkTable` etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* This change is already covered by existing tests.\r\n* Added test to verify `TableEnviroment#fromTableSource` behavior: `org.apache.flink.table.runtime.stream.table.TableSourceITCase#testInlineCsvTableSource`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

There also introduces a bridge class named `SqlExecutableStatement` which handle all the interaction between `SqlNode` to `TableEnvironment`.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n  - *Create a new module named flink-sql-parser*\r\n  - *Support create/drop table DDL grammar*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *FlinkSqlParserImplTest* and *FlinkSqlUnParserTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes The flink-table-planner and flink-table-planner-blink will depends on this new module flink-sql-parser\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - How is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nInspired from [Chinese user-mail](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/e1774a42430815b689ea792103d002b1da734d6086682d34c044ef35@%3Cuser-zh.flink.apache.org%3E) which complains that host name in metrics name could only show the first part. However, their full host name is like \"ambari.host12.yy\" which means the first part \"ambari\" cannot identify anything.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, we could support to let user record their full host name in the `TaskManagerMetricGroup` so that to identify metrics from different hosts.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add new option `metrics.tm.full-hostname` in `MetricOptions` to indicate whether Flink should use fully qualified host name in task manager metrics.\r\n  - Use above metric option when `instantiateTaskManagerMetricGroup` in `TaskManagerRunner`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added test that `TaskManagerLocation#getHostName(InetAddress, boolean)` could return the host name as expected.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): **no**\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: **no**\r\n  - The serializers: **no**\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): **no**\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: **no**\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: **no**\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? **yes**\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? **docs**\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-26T17:41:26Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:38:16Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273342730,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzQyNzMw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Metrics","name":"component=Runtime/Metrics","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8545/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8545/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8545/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/dcf2c5bd6d1c3ebe4b349c2b479a66f8c225f7ce","head":{"label":"Myasuka:tm-full-name","ref":"tm-full-name","sha":"dcf2c5bd6d1c3ebe4b349c2b479a66f8c225f7ce","user":{"login":"Myasuka","id":1709104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka","html_url":"https://github.com/Myasuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34106882,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDEwNjg4Mg==","name":"flink","full_name":"Myasuka/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Myasuka","id":1709104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3MDkxMDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1709104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka","html_url":"https://github.com/Myasuka","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Myasuka/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Myasuka/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Use the correct return type for process function in MyProcessWindowFunction *\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify windows.md and windows.zh.md*\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*This just changes the doc file*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes /  **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-25T00:59:48Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T15:56:34Z","closed_at":"2019-10-23T10:52:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5a5cf330340db9658960e7cd35563bd8931a513b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273055469,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDU1NDY5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/DataStream","name":"component=API/DataStream","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8540/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8540/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8540/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/32e54a0f01167f0798930d7104d8ebd5716b95c8","head":{"label":"cyq89051127:master","ref":"master","sha":"32e54a0f01167f0798930d7104d8ebd5716b95c8","user":{"login":"cyq89051127","id":5353709,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzNTM3MDk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5353709?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127","html_url":"https://github.com/cyq89051127","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cyq89051127/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9fa61aa505b09a3c57e9b8432ac05fe1fcc838ec","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo implement OutputFormat to write Hive tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Implemented `HiveTableOutputFormat` that can be used to write Hive tables.\r\n  - `HiveTableOutputFormat` uses Hive's output formats, SerDe, and RecordWriter to write data.\r\n  - Added `HMSClientFactory` as a unified factory to create HMS client.\r\n  - Added `HiveTableUtil` to provide util methods to access Hive tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test `HiveTableOutputFormatTest` to test HiveTableOutputFormat.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): yes\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

is a rebased and cleaned-up version of #7782\r\n\r\n# What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* Add a new serialization schema that directly uses `ProducerRecord`, thereby exposing all available Kafka functionality.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* We introduce the new schema, along with backwards-compatibility code in the different FlinkKafkaProducers\r\n* This extends the existing ITCases to also use the new serializer and still use the old serializer\r\n\r\n(side note, the Kafka tests are quite heavy and probably shouldn't be like this, but the aim of this PR is not to fix

the YARN tests to only execute assertion within `@Test` methods. Previously, assertions were also executed in `@After` methods, which tends to make the output on test failure more difficult to read.\r\n\r\nI added a `runTests(Runnable)` method to the `YarnTestBase` which encapsulates the previous `@After` assertions. All existing tests were modified to use this method instead.\r\n\r\nAs a result the majority of changes in this PR are about indentation and exception signatures.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,\r\n* the yarn client is shutdown in `@After`\r\n* an unused field was removed\r\n* a timeout was removed from \r\n`YARNSessionCapacitySchedulerITCase#testVCoresAreSetCorrectlyAndJobManagerHostnameAreShownInWebInterfaceAndDynamicPropertiesAndYarnApplicationNameAndTaskManagerSlots` so that the timeouts defined in test themselves cause the failure next

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn FlinkShell, we treat different kinds of cluster mode, and use scala pattern matching to handle that. \r\nThis is not necessary and make code unreadable. We can unify them into ClusterClient which support all the cluster modes. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n1. Refactoring on `FlinkShell.scala`\r\n   * Replace `Option[Either[MiniCluster , ClusterClient[_]]]` with `ClusterClient[_]`\r\n   * Move ClusterClient into `FlinkILoop.scala` so that let `FlinkILoop` control the shutdown of `ClusterClient` (shutdown ClusterClient in `FlinkILoop#closeInterpreter`)\r\n   * Introduce method `startShell(config: Config, in: Option[BufferedReader], out: JPrintWriter)` to make production code and test code consistency. (Don't need to introduce `bufferedReader` for unit testing)\r\n\r\n2. Refactoring on unit test code\r\n   * Refactoring method `ScalaShellITCase#processInShell` to make it readable. Now each test will create a new FlinkShell instance which create a new `MiniCluster` by default. \r\n   * Remove `ScalaShellLocalStartupITCase` as `ScalaShellITCase` already cover this case after this PR.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n```\r\nScalaShellITCase\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This pull request supports to submit Python Table API jobs via REST API.*\r\nTo support submit resource files other than jar, we need to update the REST API a bit as specified in [FLIP38](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-38%3A+Python+Table+API)\r\n\r\nCurrent REST API | New REST API | Remarks\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nGET /jars | GET /artifacts | Now it lists both jar files and python package files.\r\nPOST /jars/upload | POST /artifacts/upload | Allow users to upload both jar files and python package files. Use \"Content-Type\" in the request header to mark the file type.\r\nDELETE /jars/:jarid | DELETE /artifacts/:artifactid | Delete files according to “artifactid”.\r\nGET /jars/:jarid/plan | GET /artifacts/:artifactid/plan | We will introduce a new optional parameter:pythonEntryModule.It allows specifying a python entry point module other than __main__.py.\r\nPOST /jars/:jarid/run | POST /artifacts/:artifactid/run | We also introduce the optional pythonEntryModule parameter here, as same as above.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *[2c4d575](https://github.com/dianfu/flink/commit/2c4d5752c8e2783b5d309c8730677da555be6e7e): Changes the REST API prefix from /jars to /artifacts as we will not only support upload jar files, but also Python resource files. This commit also refactor the class name prefix from JarXXX to ArtifactXXX*\r\n  - *[c286149](https://github.com/dianfu/flink/commit/c286149bf3bd7133bb395cd38814b29652339a46): Updates the web to use the new /artifacts REST API instead of the /jars REST API*\r\n  - *[b516468](https://github.com/dianfu/flink/commit/b516468cb7b7957358101f57a07f1c704034a621) Supports to submit Python Table API jobs. It supports to submit Python Table API jobs via resource files such as .py, .zip and .egg.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added tests ArtifactHandlerUtilsTest.testExtractContainedLibraries, ArtifactXXXTest*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*In order to make abstract `InputGate` simple for extending new implementations in shuffle service architecture, we could remove unnecessary methods from it.*\r\n\r\n*Currently `InputGate#getOwningTaskName` is only used for debugging log in `BarrierBuffer` and `StreamInputProcessor`. This task name could be got from `Environment#getTaskInfo` and then be passed into the constructor of `BarrierBuffer/StreamInputProcessor` for use.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add the full task name in the `TaskInfo`*\r\n  - *Remove `getOwningTaskName`  from `InputGate` abstract methods*\r\n  - *Refactor the related process to get task name for `BarrierBuffer` and `StreamInputProcessor`*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\ncovered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](http://flink.apache.org/contribute-code.html#best-practices).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request removes the legacy flink-ml and flink-ml-uber in flink-libraries. They have been not maintained for long time and there is also not any active commit planned. Since we've reached the consensus on the new flink-ml framework proposed in FLIP-39, it's better to remove them in case of confusion.\r\nExisting users can still use previous versions.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Remove flink-libraries/flink-ml, flink-libraries/flink-ml-uber, and their registration in pom.xml in flink-libraries\r\n  - Remove dependency of flink-ml-uber in flink-dist, and its registration in opt.xml for maven-assembly-plugin\r\n  - Docs about flink-ml are temporally retained\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change only remove existing modules, which are independent from most other modules. This change can be varified if other existing tests can still pass.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* `StatsDReporterTest` is unstable, fix it\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* The reason of unstable is that, there is a race condition of `DatagramSocketReceiver.waitUntilNumLines`.\r\n* We need to get the lock outside the loop since `Object.wait` might wake up without a notification. It might miss the notification when checking the loop condition caused by self wakeup.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* This change is already covered by existing tests\r\n* I have verified it by looping executing `StatsDReporterTest.testStatsDMetersReportingOfNegativeValues`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR moves invocation of timer callback (`ProcessingTimeCallback`) from `SystemProcessingTimeService` execution thread pool into `StreamTask`'s main thread (passing callback via mailbox introduced in [[FLINK-12480]](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-12480)).\r\n\r\nThis is a sub-task of general effort of moving away from using concurrent access to `StreamTask`'s state.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - The `checkpointLock` and `AsyncExceptionHandler` are moved out of `SystemProcessingTimeService` as abstract invocation context (`ScheduledCallbackExecutionContext`). So the service is abstracted and is not concerned about `StreamTask`'s use case.\r\n  - The implementation of `ScheduledCallbackExecutionContext` for `StreamTask` uses mailbox (instead of locking on `checkpointLock`) to delegate timer callback invocation in main task's thread.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - A test in `StreamTaskTest` has been modified to verify new runtime invariant;\r\n\r\nNote: `StreamTaskTimerTest` fails (regression) due to blocking in `inputProcessor.processInput()`. In both tests the task thread get interrupted, without peeking any mailbox messages (timer callbacks in those tests are already in mailbox queue).\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / **don't know**)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / **don't know**)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / **don't know**)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2019-05-23T13:12:20Z","updated_at":"2019-06-20T06:40:56Z","closed_at":"2019-05-31T15:12:48Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b5ab6db07a6420062e64bde5c29809e503fb257","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8523/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/8523/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/8523/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ad68e50f673fca6d8d7ede61ad9d3f2b9dc44f8f","head":{"label":"1u0:flink-12481-invoke-timer-callback-in-task-thread","ref":"flink-12481-invoke-timer-callback-in-task-thread","sha":"ad68e50f673fca6d8d7ede61ad9d3f2b9dc44f8f","user":{"login":"1u0","id":488251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODI1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/488251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0","html_url":"https://github.com/1u0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":155554452,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTU1NTQ0NTI=","name":"flink","full_name":"1u0/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"1u0","id":488251,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODI1MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/488251?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0","html_url":"https://github.com/1u0","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1u0/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/1u0/flink","description":"Apache
