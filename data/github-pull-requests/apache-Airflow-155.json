new configuration parameter \"CORE_IGNOREFILE_SYNTAX\" is added to\r\nallow patterns in .airflowignore files to be interpreted as either\r\nregular expressions (the default) or glob expressions as found in\r\n.gitignore files. This allows users to use patterns they will be\r\nfamiliar with from tools such as git, helm and docker.\r\n\r\nGlob expressions support wildcard matches (\"*\", \"?\") within a directory\r\nas well as character classes (\"[0-9]\"). In addition, zero or more\r\ndirectories can be matched using \"**\". Patterns can be negated by\r\nprefixing a \"!\" at the beginning of the pattern.\r\n\r\nThe \"fnmatch\" library in core Python does not produce patterns that are\r\nfully compliant with the kind of patterns that users will be used to\r\nfrom gitignore or dockerignore files, so the globs are parsed using\r\nthe gitignore-parser package from PyPI.\r\n\r\nTo aid with debugging ignorefile patterns a more helpful error\r\nmessage is emitted in the logs for invalid patterns, which are\r\nnow skipped rather than causing a hard-to-read scheduler stack trace.\r\n\r\ncloses:

of our users do not understand how DAG deactivation, deletion\r\nworks - it's quite straightforward for us, who understand how\r\nscheduler, serialization and refresh works, but we have not really\r\ndocumented everywhere what the differences are between pausing,\r\ndeactivation and actual deletion of the metadata.\r\n\r\nIt has been distributed in a few places (API documentation, comments\r\nwhen you issued a \"delete\" UI action, but I found that there is no\r\nsingle place where it is described.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds documentation in \"DAG\" page about it - explaining\r\nwhat happens in those different states and instructing the user\r\nto follow -> remove dag file -> wait for deactivation -> delete\r\npattern if they want to remove a DAG.\r\n\r\nRelated:

an old PR https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/14263 we tried to add a \"retry\" mechanism for triggering new ECS task but it didn't work as expected according to my explanation in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/16150. \r\n\r\nThe TL;DR version is: \r\n\r\n* The immediate API response after sending out the `run_task` request to aws is not reliable. To make sure our task is really running in good health, we have to wait and send out another `describe_tasks` request.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis explanation still holds today. Since people start using Fargate nowadays, this issue becomes more and more acute. On a good day, 0.15% Fargate tasks could fail to start due to ENI (AWS Elastic Network Interface) provision failures. However on a bad day, it could rise to 1~2%.\r\n\r\nPer recommendations from the AWS support team, we should consider the \"triggering an ECS task, waiting for it to be provisioned, checking for its status\" steps a single routine that can be retried as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis PR is largely based on the framework established in https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/14263.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is a very probable WeakKeyDict bug in Python standard\r\nlibrary (to be confirmed and investigated further) that\r\nmanifests itself in a very rare failure of

you have potentially two different objects with the\r\nsame `equals` and `hash` values added to the same\r\nWeakKeyDict as keys.\r\n\r\nMore info on similar report (but raised for a bit different\r\nreason) bug in Python can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.python.org/issue44140\r\n\r\nWhile we are still investigating the root cause and possibly\r\nsubmit a bug to Python, this PR

tests (particularly with the export subcommand) were doing a fair bit of unnecessary mocking.  In particular they mocked `builtins.open`.  But there's no good reason that we can't actually write out the file and read the file in the assert (which is a much better way to test this).  There were also a number of assertions re `splittext` which are not really relevant.\r\n\r\nI suspect the reason that the author did this is because the file wasn't _closed_, so when you read the value from the exported file (if the process has not been exited) then the buffer may not be fully written to disk.  I fix this by closing the file after writing the connections.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change I also update to use current pytest techniques for parameterization and temp files.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-04T05:50:42Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T16:36:16Z","closed_at":"2022-03-04T18:26:20Z","merged_at":"2022-03-04T18:26:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"e81527c5d39840b37180060a0865467c37d698ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"uranusjr","id":605277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/605277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr","html_url":"https://github.com/uranusjr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/uranusjr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1672279581,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjcyMjc5NTgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:CLI","name":"area:CLI","color":"e99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes

of always using MagicMock to validate mapped arguments, this implements a more sophisticated protocol that allows an operator to implement a `validate_mapped_arguments` to provide custom validation logic. If an operator just wants to use `__init__` for validation, however, they can set a flag `mapped_arguments_validated_by_init` to get the behavior easily. (This does *not* use MagicMock, however, since any custom validation logic should be able to handle those on its own).\r\n\r\nThe `validate_mapped_arguments` flag is currently only set on PythonOperator. It can likely be used on a lot more operators down the road.\r\n","created_at":"2022-03-02T10:16:40Z","updated_at":"2022-04-26T16:49:28Z","closed_at":"2022-03-03T17:10:09Z","merged_at":"2022-03-03T17:10:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"b65e52205a7045eb08d471289b85abda587442b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"kaxil","id":8811558,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MTE1NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8811558?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil","html_url":"https://github.com/kaxil","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kaxil/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"XD-DENG","id":11539188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTM5MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11539188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG","html_url":"https://github.com/XD-DENG","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/XD-DENG/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2057471696,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDU3NDcxNjk2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/changelog:skip","name":"changelog:skip","color":"a8f731","default":false,"description":"Changes
