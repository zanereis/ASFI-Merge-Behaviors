Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen reading to vector of certain null child columns of row type column, `RowColumnReader` should not return null value because the value of the row type column may not be null, which results in incorrect values of row type column.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe return value `RowColumnReader#readToVector` is correct for the row type column in the case that there are certain null child columns.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\n_If medium or high, explain what verification was done to mitigate the risks._\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

Change Logs\r\nAdd support for write success file to a finished partition in flink streaming append write:\r\n1. add a SuccessFileWriteFunction class which aimed at to write succe file to partition, and add operator state to store the active partitions and finished partitions to avoid them lost data while failover;\r\n2. add  flink options\r\n `partition.write-success-file.enable` to switch whether enable this feature in flink job；\r\n `partition.write-success-file.delay` the delay of write success file;\r\n``\r\n3.  change `HoodieTableSink` class, support to extract partition path from streaming record, and emit to extract.\r\n4.  Use DefaultPartTimeExtractor in flink to extract the timestamp from partition path, and adapt it in different flink versions (1.13x, 1.14x, 1.15x)\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nUsed in flink sql job consume from mq and write into hudi, if you want to use this feature, set the options as below in hudi sink table ddl\r\n```\r\ncreate table test_out(\r\nid  bigint,\r\ndata string,\r\n  `day` string,\r\n  `hour` string\r\n) partitioned by (`day`, `hour`)\r\nwith (\r\n 'connector' = 'hudi',\r\n 'partition.time-extractor.timestamp-pattern' = '$day $hour:00:00',\r\n 'partition.write-success-file.delay' = '1h',   -- if the table partitioned by hour, set the delay 1h; if the table partitioned by day, set the delay 1day;\r\n 'partition.write-success-file.enable' = 'true',\r\n 'table.type' = 'COPY_ON_WRITE',\r\n 'write.operation' = 'insert',\r\n 'write.tasks' = '5',\r\n 'write.insert.cluster' = 'false',\r\n 'metadata.enabled' = 'true',\r\n 'path' = 'hdfs://testcluster/user/test/hudi/test_out14',\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nLOW\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the

Change Logs\r\n\r\nIn #5416, we added new `DisruptorExecutor` relying on LMAX Disruptor in lieu of `BoundedInMemoryQueue` for queueing records.\r\n\r\nHowever following things were missed during review:\r\n - Missed adding Disruptor as a dep included into the bundles.\r\n - Missed wiring `QueueBasedExecutorFactory` into `HoodieMergeHelper` (as well as others)\r\n\r\nThis PR rectifies these

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFor spark with version greater than 3.2+, the query of hudi table using spark sql supports reading parameter configuration.\r\n\r\nPreviously, when we used Spark SQL to read the hudi table, we could only read the rt table or the ro table, or use timestamp as of for time travel. However, for incremental data reading, some personalized reading parameter configurations cannot be used.\r\non this pr, can query hudi table :\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n// query snapshot table\r\nselect id, name, price, ts from $tableName1 ['hoodie.datasource.query.type'=>'snapshot','as.of.instant'=>'$instant1'] \r\n// query incremental table\r\nselect id, name, price, ts from $tableName1\r\n   |[\r\n   |'hoodie.datasource.query.type'=>'incremental',\r\n   |'hoodie.datasource.read.begin.instanttime'=>'$instant1',\r\n   |'hoodie.datasource.read.end.instanttime'=>'$instant2'\r\n   |]\r\n// query read_optimized table\r\nselect id, name, price, ts from $tableName1 ['hoodie.datasource.query.type'=>'read_optimized']\r\n// table union\r\nselect id, name, price, ts from $tableName1 ['hoodie.datasource.query.type'=>'snapshot','as.of.instant'=>'$instant1'] where id=1\r\nunion\r\nselect id, name, price, ts from $tableName2 ['hoodie.datasource.query.type'=>'snapshot','as.of.instant'=>'$instant2'] where id>1\r\n\r\n// Insert into static partition\r\n insert into $tableName2 partition(dt = '2022-02-15')\r\n select 2 as id, 'a2' as name, price, ts\r\n from $tableName1 ['hoodie.datasource.query.type'=>'snapshot','as.of.instant'=>'$instant1']\r\n\r\n// Insert into dynamic partition\r\n insert into $tableName2\r\n select id, name, price, ts, '2022-02-14' as dt\r\n from $tableName1 ['hoodie.datasource.query.type'=>'snapshot','as.of.instant'=>'$instant1']\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\nspark sql query.\r\nModify the spark3.2x .g4 file & ExtendedSqlAstBuilder.\r\nModify the spark3.3x .g4 file & ExtendedSqlAstBuilder.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow \r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [x] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [x] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [x] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nFollowed PR https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/5416\r\n\r\nAdd a new Executor Type named `SIMPLE` for hoodie records writer.\r\n\r\nThis Simple executor is `Single Writer and Single Reader mode`. Also this SimpleHoodieExecutor has no inner message queue and no inner lock which can consume and writing records from iterator directly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvantages: There is no need for additional memory and cpu resources due to lock or multithreading.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages: lost some benefits such as speed limit. And can not de-coupe the network read (shuffle read) and network write (writing objects/files to storage) anymore which may cause a little lower throughput compared with DisruptorExecutor.\r\n\r\nAlso I did a quick benchmark using hoodie benchmark framework `org.apache.spark.sql.execution.benchmark.BoundInMemoryExecutorBenchmark`\r\n\r\nMinimize the impact of producers and consumers efficiency issue as much as possible to focus on testing the throughput limit of the inner queue\r\n\r\nThe result are \r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_342-b07 on Linux

Change Logs\r\n\r\nParallelism does not take effect when `hoodie.combine.before.upsert/insert` false\r\nIt may cause data skew without shuffle based on our PRD experience.\r\n\r\n```\r\nhoodie.upsert.shuffle.parallelism\r\n\r\nParallelism to use for upsert operation on the table. Upserts can shuffle data to perform index lookups, file sizing, bin packing records optimallyinto file groups.\r\nDefault Value: 200 (Optional)\r\nConfig Param: UPSERT_PARALLELISM_VALUE\r\n\r\nhoodie.insert.shuffle.parallelism\r\n\r\nParallelism for inserting records into the table.

1: users set upsert with `hoodie.combine.before.upsert` false (default true)\r\n\r\nscene 2: users set insert with `hoodie.combine.before.insert` false (default false)\r\n\r\nBoth scenes will have an

Change Logs\r\n\r\nPartition path field is not supposed to change so now there is validation to make sure of that.\r\n\r\nI moved validateTableConfig to after validateKeyGeneratorConfig because some tests were failing due to the wrong error message showing up.\r\n\r\nAlso had to modify a test that was violating this validation\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nNow throws exception instead of letting user do something wrong.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNone needed\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read

Change Logs\r\n\r\nWhen multiple writers are writing to the same Hudi table under optimistic concurrency control, one writer may start later and finish the write transaction earlier than the other concurrent writer.  In this case, the Hudi timeline contains an inflight commit before a completed commit.  As a concrete example, writer 1 starts a commit at t1 and later writer 2 starts another commit at t2 (t2 > t1). Commit t2 finishes earlier than t1.\r\n```\r\n                                       t3        t4\r\n---------------------------------------------------------> t\r\n instant t1 |------------------------------| (writer 1)\r\n instant t2         |--------------|         (writer 2) \r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen Hudi incremental source is used on such a Hudi table, the logic to determine the next fetch (`IncrSourceHelper.calculateBeginAndEndInstants()`) is susceptible to data loss, missing the inflight instants.  The method filters for the completed instants only and uses that to determine the instants to fetch, thus the checkpoint.  For the same example, when incrementally fetching the data at t3, the checkpoint advances to t2 and ignores t1 indefinitely.\r\n\r\nTo fix the problem, this PR adds the logic to only look at contiguous completed commits / deltacommits / non-clustering replacecommits for incremental pulls, e.g., completed instants before t1 in the example, so that the checkpoint never goes over the inflight commits which can cause data loss.  To implement this, we figure out the earliest incomplete commit, deltacommit, or non-clustering replacecommit to bound the incremental pulls.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the `HoodieIncrSource`, `S3EventsHoodieIncrSource`, and `GcsEventsHoodieIncrSource` for the same issue.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids missing instants for incremental pulls for the scenarios mentioned above for multi-writer.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\nThis PR adds two new tests, `TestHoodieIncrSource#testHoodieIncrSourceInflightCommitBeforeCompletedCommit` and `TestHoodieIncrSource#testHoodieIncrSourceWithPendingTableServices`, to verify the expected behavior.  Before this PR, the first test failed.\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nSometimes users prefer to sort the incoming records based on some columns with insert/upsert. As of now, sorting is supported only w/ bulk_insert. This patch adds the support with insert and upsert operation as well. \r\n\r\nTypical use-case:\r\nClassic problem of event time vs query predicates. in case of uber's trip data, dataset will be partitioned on datestr, but most of the queries might be based on city_id. So, instead of relying on clustering to sort after the fact, this patch adds support to sort before ingesting only. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nUsers will now be able to optionally sort records based on columns of their choice while ingesting records with insert or upsert. \r\nConfigs of interest:\r\nhoodie.write.sort.mode: possible values NONE, GLOBAL_SORT and PARTITIONER_SORT\r\nhoodie.write.sort.cols: comma separated list of columns to sort. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nMedium\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n_Describe any necessary documentation update if there is any new feature, config, or user-facing change_\r\n\r\n- _The config description must be updated if new configs are added or the default value of the configs are changed_\r\n- _Any new feature or user-facing change requires updating the Hudi website. Please create a Jira ticket, attach the\r\n  ticket number here and follow the [instruction](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/developer-setup#website) to make\r\n  changes to the website._\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-06T04:25:52Z","updated_at":"2024-02-28T05:06:30Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1363733381,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzYzNzMzMzgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/pr:wip","name":"pr:wip","color":"b7195b","default":false,"description":"Work

Change Logs\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5175\r\n\r\nAs the Hudi table continues to grow, the number of data files, partitions, and filegroups continues to increase。 Also the reader takes longer and longer to complete `spark.read.format(\"hudi\").load(basePath)`.\r\n\r\nHere are the related logs from our PRD environment:\r\n```\r\n22/11/04 08:07:10 INFO ClusteringUtils: Found 0 files in pending clustering operations\r\n22/11/04 08:10:05 INFO AbstractTableFileSystemView: addFilesToView: NumFiles=5074664, NumFileGroups=815386, FileGroupsCreationTime=175084, StoreTimeTaken=360\r\n22/11/04 08:10:07 INFO HoodieFileIndex: Refresh table ds_segments, spend: 1010161 ms\r\n```\r\nWe now need nearly 10+ min to complete the hudi table load, although the follow-up is just a simple sql.\r\n\r\nIn short, the time overhead of hudi load is mainly divided into two parts. \r\nThe first part is to obtain partitions and files --> This part can be optimized using MDT\r\n\r\nThe second part is the compute logic for grouping partitions and files, that is\r\n`22/11/04 08:10:05 INFO AbstractTableFileSystemView: addFilesToView: NumFiles=5074664, NumFileGroups=815386, FileGroupsCreationTime=175084, StoreTimeTaken=360` \r\nIt takes 3 minutes and the time increases as the amount of data increases. ==> This PR is mainly to optimize this part.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nno Impact\r\n\r\nAdd a new flag\r\n```\r\n  public static final ConfigProperty<Integer> TABLE_LOADING_PARALLELISM = ConfigProperty\r\n      .key(\"hoodie.datasource.read.loading.parallelism\")\r\n      .defaultValue(-1)\r\n      .withDocumentation(\"Set the parallelism of loading hudi table. \"\r\n          + \"In general local parallelism can be tried from 20\"\r\n          + \"-1 means disable parallel, and serial load hudi table.\");\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe default behavior is the same as master branch.\r\n\r\nHere is the **performance test result** using DEV hudi table\r\n\r\nData volume : 50TiB\r\nFile number: 659270\r\nPartition number : 27000\r\n\r\nDefault behavior :\r\n```\r\nval basePath = \"s3a://lake-house-hudi/sample_hudi_data_performance_test\"\r\nval hudi_df = spark.time(spark.read.option(\"hoodie.metadata.enable\", \"true\").format(\"hudi\").load(basePath))\r\n\r\n==> \r\n\r\n2022-11-08 02:46:44,777 INFO hudi.BaseHoodieTableFileIndex: Build cache file slices, spent: 22747 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nLocal parallel mode :\r\n```\r\nval basePath = \"s3a://lake-house-hudi/sample_hudi_data_performance_test\"\r\nval hudi_df = spark.time(spark.read.option(\"hoodie.metadata.enable\", \"true\").option(\"hoodie.datasource.read.loading.parallelism\", 10).format(\"hudi\").load(basePath))\r\n\r\n==> \r\n\r\n2022-11-08 03:40:12,457 INFO hudi.BaseHoodieTableFileIndex: Build cache file slices, spent: 10557 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs we can see this PR can improved about 40% ~ 55% performance for second part mentioned above.\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nnot update now\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-05T00:38:33Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T07:05:43Z","closed_at":"2023-05-14T07:05:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"58f23bfb8a52c0393ab4111272f24cbe55ef0c83","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719800718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAwNzE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:critical","name":"priority:critical","color":"B60205","default":false,"description":"production

Change Logs\r\n\r\nYou can now use wildcard * when listing partition paths in DELETE_PARTITIONS \r\n\r\nAlso fixed the test testDeletePartitionsV2 because the if statement wasn't doing anything. After making it update the configs, it failed. To fix that I added the second partition path comma separated because the test expected the first 2 paths to be deleted.\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nFeature that was wanted\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nhigh\r\nThere is potential to accidentally delete a bunch of partitions so we should make sure that the logic there is correct. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nUpdated config documentation which is uploaded to site?\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's

Change Logs\r\n\r\nHoodieIncrSource was dropping every meta field from source except partition path. If 3 hudi tables are chained (tableA, tableB incrementally reads from tableA, tableC incrementally reads from tableB), the 3rd table when reading from tableB fails w/ duplicate columns. So, adding a config to drop all meta fields. Tested chaining 3 hudi tables in a row and it worked. \r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nWe can chain any number of hudi tables now with Hoodie Incr Source. \r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow. \r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nNew config added: \r\n`hoodie.deltastreamer.source.hoodieincr.drop.all.meta.fields.from.source` \r\nDefault value is false. When set to true, chaining of any number of tables work. \r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI

Change Logs\r\n\r\nAdding support to filter tests based on tags. We can now filter both java and scala tests from maven command line. \r\n\r\nEg for java: Add \r\n```\r\n@Tag(\"FlakyTests\")\r\n```\r\nto any java tests. and then run command as below. \r\n```\r\nmvn  -Pflaky-tests  -Dcheckstyle.skip -DfailIfNoTests=false  -Drat.ignoreErrors=true test -pl hudi-spark-datasource/hudi-spark/\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor scala tests, some more manual step is required. \r\nWe

root configuration from Context to Hudi and Hadoop\r\n\r\n### Change Logs\r\n\r\nThe configurations are not passed on to the hadoop configs, which means no flink configuration is accessible to hadoop libraries.\r\nFixed this specifically for Azure : \r\n- Azure required auth type, token provider, client id and secret for active directory based authentication.\r\n- This is passed through flink's or spark's config options, which was not being translated to hadoop configurations\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nIntegration with Azure Blob Store or Data Lake\r\n\r\n### Risk level (write none, low medium or high below)\r\n\r\nlow\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\n- The Flink integration document needs to be added/updated.\r\n- Config needs to be appended with `hadoop.`\r\n`config.setString(\"hadoop.fs.azure.authorization\",\"true\");\r\nconfig.setString(\"hadoop.fs.azure.account.auth.type\",\"OAuth\");\r\nconfig.setString(\"hadoop.fs.azure.account.oauth.provider.type\",\"org.apache.hadoop.fs.azurebfs.oauth2.ClientCredsTokenProvider\");\r\nconfig.setString(\"hadoop.fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.id\",\"<app-id>\");\r\nconfig.setString(\"hadoop.fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.secret\",\"<client-secret>\");\r\nconfig.setString(\"hadoop.fs.azure.account.oauth2.client.endpoint\",\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/oauth2/token\");\r\nconfig.setString(\"hadoop.fs.azure.createRemoteFileSystemDuringInitialization\",\"true\");`\r\n\r\n###

Change Logs\r\n\r\nCurrently, the `HoodieFileIndex` used by `HoodieBaseRelation` is not compatible with Databricks Spark runtime (while `HoodieFileIndex` is compatible with OSS Spark).  We need to disable HoodieFileIndex and fall back to HoodieROTablePathFilter to make queries work on Hudi tables in Databricks Spark runtime.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the feature flag of `hoodie.file.index.enable` back to decide whether to enable `HoodieFileIndex` or not.  This affects COW snapshot query and MOR read-optimized query only.\r\n\r\nNew tests with `HoodieFileIndex` disabled are added.\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n\r\nThe config `hoodie.file.index.enable` is restored so that a user can set `hoodie.file.index.enable=false` to run queries on Hudi tables in Databricks Spark runtime.\r\n\r\n### Risk level\r\n\r\nmedium\r\n\r\nThe default of `hoodie.file.index.enable` is still true, the same as before.\r\n\r\nThe change is tested on Databricks Runtime `11.3 LTS (includes Apache Spark 3.3.0, Scala 2.12)` and queries on Hudi tables on S3 are successful using Spark datasource with `hoodie.file.index.enable=false`:\r\n```\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.file.index.enable\", \"false\").load(\"s3a://<bucket>/tpc-ds/hudi/1TB/customer\")\r\ndf.count\r\ndf.show\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.file.index.enable\", \"false\").load(\"s3a://<bucket>/benchmarks/tpc-ds/hudi/1TB/customer/*\")\r\ndf.count\r\ndf.show\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.file.index.enable\", \"false\").load(\"s3a://<bucket>/benchmarks/tpc-ds/hudi/1TB/catalog_sales/\")\r\ndf.count\r\ndf.show\r\nval df = spark.read.format(\"hudi\").option(\"hoodie.file.index.enable\", \"false\").load(\"s3a://<bucket>/benchmarks/tpc-ds/hudi/1TB/catalog_sales/*/*\")\r\ndf.count\r\ndf.show\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation Update\r\n\r\nDocs update ticket: [HUDI-5498](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-5498).\r\n\r\n### Contributor's checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] Read through [contributor's guide](https://hudi.apache.org/contribute/how-to-contribute)\r\n- [ ] Change Logs and Impact were stated clearly\r\n- [ ] Adequate tests were added if applicable\r\n- [ ] CI passed\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-28T22:52:40Z","updated_at":"2023-07-27T06:54:22Z","closed_at":"2022-12-16T17:36:51Z","merged_at":"2022-12-16T17:36:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"956d20ba2c4fe0d62a42c71c5942ce9ddb982223","assignee":{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"alexeykudinkin","id":428277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODI3Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/428277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin","html_url":"https://github.com/alexeykudinkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/alexeykudinkin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"codope","id":16440354,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2NDQwMzU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16440354?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope","html_url":"https://github.com/codope","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codope/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2719802999,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE5ODAyOTk5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/labels/priority:major","name":"priority:major","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":"degraded
