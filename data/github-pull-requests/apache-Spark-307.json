What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn previous work SPARK-21513, we has allowed `MapType` and `ArrayType` of `MapType`s convert to a json string but only for Scala API. In this follow-up PR, we will make SparkSQL support it for PySpark and SparkR, too. We also fix some little bugs and comments of the previous work in this follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n### For PySpark\r\n```\r\n>>> data = [(1, {\"name\": \"Alice\"})]\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame(data, (\"key\", \"value\"))\r\n>>> df.select(to_json(df.value).alias(\"json\")).collect()\r\n[Row(json=u'{\"name\":\"Alice\")']\r\n>>> data = [(1, [{\"name\": \"Alice\"}, {\"name\": \"Bob\"}])]\r\n>>> df = spark.createDataFrame(data, (\"key\", \"value\"))\r\n>>> df.select(to_json(df.value).alias(\"json\")).collect()\r\n[Row(json=u'[{\"name\":\"Alice\"},{\"name\":\"Bob\"}]')]\r\n```\r\n### For SparkR\r\n```\r\n# Converts a map into a JSON object\r\ndf2 <- sql(\"SELECT map('name', 'Bob')) as people\")\r\ndf2 <- mutate(df2, people_json = to_json(df2$people))\r\n# Converts an array of maps into a JSON array\r\ndf2 <- sql(\"SELECT array(map('name', 'Bob'), map('name', 'Alice')) as people\")\r\ndf2 <- mutate(df2, people_json = to_json(df2$people))\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit test cases.\r\n\r\ncc @viirya @HyukjinKwon

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR allows us to use one of several types of `MemoryBlock`, such as byte array, int array, long array, or `java.nio.DirectByteBuffer`. To use `java.nio.DirectByteBuffer` allows to have off heap memory which is automatically deallocated by JVM. `MemoryBlock`  class has primitive accessors like `Platform.getInt()`, `Platform.putint()`, or `Platform.copyMemory()`. \r\n\r\nThis PR uses `MemoryBlock` for `OffHeapColumnVector`, `UTF8String`, and other places. This PR can improve performance of operations involving memory accesses (e.g. `UTF8String.trim`) by 1.8x.\r\n\r\nFor now, this PR does not use `MemoryBlock` for `BufferHolder` based on @cloud-fan's [suggestion](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11494#issuecomment-309694290).\r\n\r\nSince this PR is a successor of #11494, close #11494. Many codes were ported from #11494. Many efforts were put here. **I think this PR should credit to @yzotov.**\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR can achieve **1.1-1.4x performance improvements** for  operations in `UTF8String` or `Murmur3_x86_32`. Other operations are almost comparable performances.\r\n\r\nWithout this PR\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_121-8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.04.2-b13 on Linux 4.4.0-22-generic\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_121-8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.04.2-b13 on Linux 4.4.0-22-generic\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz\r\nHash byte arrays with length 268435487:  Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMurmur3_x86_32                                 526 /  536          0.0   131399881.5       1.0X\r\n\r\nUTF8String benchmark:                    Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nhashCode                                       525 /  552       1022.6           1.0       1.0X\r\nsubstring                                      414 /  423       1298.0           0.8       1.3X\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_121-8u121-b13-0ubuntu1.16.04.2-b13 on Linux 4.4.0-22-generic\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz\r\nHash byte arrays with length 268435487:  Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMurmur3_x86_32                                 474 /  488          0.0   118552232.0       1.0X\r\n\r\nUTF8String benchmark:                    Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nhashCode                                       476 /  480       1127.3           0.9       1.0X\r\nsubstring                                      287 /  291       1869.9           0.5       1.7X\r\n```\r\n\r\nBenchmark program\r\n```\r\ntest(\"benchmark Murmur3_x86_32\") {\r\n  val length = 8192 * 32768 + 31\r\n  val seed = 42L\r\n  val iters = 1 << 2\r\n  val random = new Random(seed)\r\n  val arrays = Array.fill[MemoryBlock](numArrays) {\r\n    val bytes = new Array[Byte](length)\r\n    random.nextBytes(bytes)\r\n    new ByteArrayMemoryBlock(bytes, Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET, length)\r\n  }\r\n                                                                \r\n  val benchmark = new Benchmark(\"Hash byte arrays with length \" + length,\r\n    iters * numArrays, minNumIters = 20) \r\n  benchmark.addCase(\"HiveHasher\") { _: Int =>\r\n    var sum = 0L\r\n    for (_ <- 0L until iters) {\r\n      sum += HiveHasher.hashUnsafeBytesBlock(\r\n        arrays(i), Platform.BYTE_ARRAY_OFFSET, length)\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  benchmark.run()   \r\n}\r\n\r\ntest(\"benchmark UTF8String\") {\r\n  val N = 512 * 1024 * 1024\r\n  val iters = 2\r\n  val benchmark = new Benchmark(\"UTF8String benchmark\", N, minNumIters = 20)\r\n  val str0 = new java.io.StringWriter() { { for (i <- 0 until N) { write(\" \") } } }.toString\r\n  val s0 = UTF8String.fromString(str0)\r\n  benchmark.addCase(\"hashCode\") { _: Int =>\r\n    var h: Int = 0\r\n    for (_ <- 0L until iters) { h += s0.hashCode }\r\n  }\r\n  benchmark.addCase(\"substring\") { _: Int =>\r\n    var s: UTF8String = null\r\n    for (_ <- 0L until iters) { s = s0.substring(N / 2 - 5, N / 2 + 5) }\r\n  }\r\n  benchmark.run()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\nI run [this benchmark program](https://gist.github.com/kiszk/94f75b506c93a663bbbc372ffe8f05de) using [the commit](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19222/commits/ee5a79861c18725fb1cd9b518cdfd2489c05b81d6).

According to the second/third or sixth/seventh results in the first experiment, if we use `Platform.get/putInt(Object)`, we achieve more than 2x worse performance than `Platform.get/putInt(byte[])` with concrete type (i.e. `byte[]`).\r\n2. According to the second/third or fourth/fifth/sixth results in the first experiment, the fastest way to access an array element on Java heap is `array[]`. **Cons of `array[]` is that it is not possible to support unaligned-8byte access.**\r\n3. According to the first/second/third or fourth/sixth/seventh results in the first experiment, `getInt()/putInt() or getLong()/putLong()` in subclasses of `MemoryBlock` can achieve comparable performance to `Platform.get/putInt()` or `Platform.get/putLong()` with concrete type (second or sixth result). There is no overhead regarding virtual call.\r\n4. According to results in the second experiment, for `Platform.copy()`, to pass `Object` can achieve the same performance as to pass any type of primitive array as source or destination.\r\n5. According to second/fourth results in the second experiment, `Platform.copy()` can achieve the same performance as `System.arrayCopy`. **It would be good to use `Platform.copy()` since `Platform.copy()` can take any types for src and dst.**\r\n\r\nWe are incrementally replace `Platform.get/putXXX` with `MemoryBlock.get/putXXX`. This is because we have two advantages.\r\n1) Achieve better performance due to having a concrete type for an array.\r\n2) Use simple OO design instead of passing `Object`\r\nIt is easy to use `MemoryBlock` in `InternalRow`, `BufferHolder`, `TaskMemoryManager`, and others that are already abstracted. It is not easy to use `MemoryBlock` in utility classes related to hashing or others.\r\n\r\nOther candidates are \r\n- UnsafeRow, UnsafeArrayData, UnsafeMapData, SpecificUnsafeRowJoiner\r\n- UTF8StringBuffer\r\n- BufferHolder\r\n- TaskMemoryManager\r\n- OnHeapColumnVector\r\n- BytesToBytesMap\r\n- CachedBatch\r\n- classes for hash\r\n- others.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen I inspected the latest change of SPARK-21979, I found we could miss few constraints that can be recursively inferred.\r\n\r\nE.g. consider constraints `a === b && b === c && a > 1 && b > 5`. Currently we only infer `a === c && b > 1 && c > 5`, but `c > 1` can be also inferred from newly inferred constraint `a === c`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded test.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-13T08:44:12Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:56Z","closed_at":"2017-09-14T02:45:16Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"054a96d1b9ec7483ab99eac09908cbc0678b2c8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19216/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19216/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19216/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e4cffda91cf9ab3673e12f1427ad1d02c5e5b71e","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-21990","ref":"SPARK-21990","sha":"e4cffda91cf9ab3673e12f1427ad1d02c5e5b71e","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

change modifies the live listener bus so that all listeners are\r\nadded to queues; each queue has its own thread to dispatch events,\r\nmaking it possible to separate slow listeners from other more\r\nperformance-sensitive ones.\r\n\r\nThe public API has not changed - all listeners added with the existing\r\n\"addListener\" method, which after this change mostly means all\r\nuser-defined listeners, end up in a default queue. Internally, there's\r\nan API allowing listeners to be added to specific queues, and that API\r\nis used to separate the internal Spark listeners into 3 categories:\r\napplication status listeners (e.g. UI), executor management (e.g. dynamic\r\nallocation), and the event log.\r\n\r\nThe queueing logic, while abstracted away in a separate class, is kept\r\nas much as possible hidden away from consumers. Aside from choosing their\r\nqueue, there's no code change needed to take advantage of queues.\r\n\r\nTest coverage relies on existing tests; a few tests had to be tweaked\r\nbecause they relied on `LiveListenerBus.postToAll` being synchronous,\r\nand the change makes that method asynchronous. Other tests were simplified\r\nnot to use the asynchronous LiveListenerBus.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-12T21:31:50Z","updated_at":"2017-12-14T13:16:06Z","closed_at":"2017-09-20T05:44:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e9c25b45f4db90b18f8c000f5c33428d029cbfe2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19211/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19211/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19211/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/283b733dbcad326898eee2f4629a8fc1891a77c7","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-18838","ref":"SPARK-18838","sha":"283b733dbcad326898eee2f4629a8fc1891a77c7","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpgrade codahale metrics library so that Graphite constructor can re-resolve hosts behind a CNAME with re-tried DNS lookups. When Graphite is deployed behind an ELB, ELB may change IP addresses based on auto-scaling needs. Using current approach yields Graphite usage impossible, fixing for that use case\r\n\r\n- Upgrade to codahale 3.1.5\r\n- Use new Graphite(host, port) constructor instead of new Graphite(new InetSocketAddress(host, port)) constructor\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe same logic is used for another project that is using the same configuration and code path, and graphite re-connect's behind ELB's are no longer an issue\r\n\r\nThis are proposed changes for codahale lib - https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics/compare/v3.1.2...v3.1.5#diff-6916c85d2dd08d89fe771c952e3b8512R120.

column sort and search for Stage Server using jQuery DataTable and REST API. Before this commit, the Stage page was generated hard-coded HTML and can not support search, also, the sorting was disabled if there is any application that has more than one attempt. Supporting search and sort (over all applications rather than the 20 entries in the current page) in any case will greatly improve the user experience.\r\nCreated the stagespage-template.html for displaying application information in datables. Added REST api endpoint and javascript code to fetch data from the endpoint and display it on the data table.\r\nBecause of the above change, certain functionalities in the page had to be modified to support the addition of datatables. For example, the toggle checkbox 'Select All' previously would add the checked fields as columns in the Task table and as rows in the Summary Metrics table, but after the change, only columns are added in the Task Table as it got tricky to add rows dynamically in the datatables.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have attached the screenshots of the Stage Page UI before and after the fix.\r\nBefore:\r\n<img width=\"1419\" alt=\"screen shot-before\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22228190/30331985-d773d9ac-979e-11e7-8920-5d11fdf8766a.png\">\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n<img

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove QueryPlanConstraints framework, make it robust and simple.\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/15319, constraints for expressions like `a = f(b, c)` is resolved. \r\nHowever, for expressions like \r\n```scala\r\na = f(b, c) && c = g(a, b)\r\n```\r\nThe current QueryPlanConstraints framework will produce non-converging constraints.\r\nEssentially, the problem is caused by having both the name and child of aliases in the same constraint set.   We infer constraints, and push down constraints as predicates in filters, later on these predicates are propagated as constraints, etc..\r\nSimply using the alias names only can resolve these problems.  The size of constraints is reduced without losing any information. We can always get these inferred constraints on child of aliases when pushing down filters.\r\n\r\nAlso, the EqualNullSafe between name and child in propagating alias is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a bit hard to explain as there are several issues here, I'll try my best. Here are the requirements:\r\n  1. A StructuredStreaming Source that can generate empty RDDs with 0 partitions\r\n  2. A StructuredStreaming query that uses the above source, performs a stateful aggregation \r\n     (mapGroupsWithState, groupBy.count, ...), and coalesce's by 1\r\n\r\nThe crux of the problem is that when a dataset has a `coalesce(1)` call, it receives a `SinglePartition` partitioning scheme. This scheme satisfies most required distributions used for aggregations such as HashAggregateExec. This causes a world of problems:\r\n  Symptom 1. If the input RDD has 0 partitions, the whole lineage will receive 0 partitions, nothing will be executed, the state store will not create any delta files. When this happens, the next trigger fails, because the StateStore fails to load the delta file for the previous trigger\r\n  Symptom 2. Let's say that there was data. Then in this case, if you stop your stream, and change `coalesce(1)` with `coalesce(2)`, then restart your stream, your stream will fail, because `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions - 1` number of StateStores will fail to find its delta files.\r\n\r\nTo fix the issues above, we must check that the partitioning of the child of a `StatefulOperator` satisfies:\r\nIf the grouping expressions are empty:\r\n  a) AllTuple distribution\r\n  b) Single physical partition\r\nIf the grouping expressions are non empty:\r\n  a) Clustered distribution\r\n  b) spark.sql.shuffle.partition # of partitions\r\nwhether or not `coalesce(1)` exists in the plan, and whether or not the input RDD for the trigger has any data.\r\n\r\nOnce you fix the above problem by adding an Exchange to the plan, you come across the following bug:\r\nIf you call `coalesce(1).groupBy().count()` on a Streaming DataFrame, and if you have a trigger with no data, `StateStoreRestoreExec` doesn't return the prior state. However, for this specific aggregation, `HashAggregateExec` after the restore returns a (0, 0) row, since we're performing a count, and there is no data. Then this data gets stored in `StateStoreSaveExec` causing the previous counts to be overwritten and lost.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRegression tests","created_at":"2017-09-12T04:35:04Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:53:57Z","closed_at":"2017-09-20T07:04:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"78d0d7884cebca87ddce757027959e2575e76106","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19196/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19196/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19196/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4eb7f4f6df3f2d5ae831bf15715651598e52c3e6","head":{"label":"brkyvz:sa-0","ref":"sa-0","sha":"4eb7f4f6df3f2d5ae831bf15715651598e52c3e6","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change allows the user to specify the maximum no. of tasks running in a given job group.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis WIP PR contains an idea how to fix ``StackOverflowError`` in ``Analyzer``.  There are open questions that have to be clarified.\r\n\r\n### General Info\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark cannot handle window expressions inside aggregate functions. There is a ``StackOverflowError`` error due to a bug in ``ExtractWindowExpressions``. There are two options:\r\n- prohibit window expressions inside aggregate functions and throw a descriptive error\r\n- improve ``ExtractWindowExpressions`` (what this PR tries to do)\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nOne reason why I introduced a separate case clause in ``ExtractWindowExpressions`` rather than trying to fix the existing one (i.e., lines 1958-1972 in ``ExtractWindowExpressions``) is the relative order of window and aggregate operations. The existing case always puts an aggregation first, which might be incorrect in some situations. For instance, the example below requires a window operation to be computed first:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    val df = Seq((1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 5)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\n    val window = Window.orderBy(\"a\")\r\n    df.groupBy().agg(max(rank().over(window)).show(false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe added part extracts window expressions only from children of aggregate functions while keeping all other window expressions untouched. Consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    val window1 = Window.orderBy(\"a\")\r\n    val window2 = Window.orderBy(max('a))\r\n    df.groupBy().agg(sum('a), max(rank().over(window1)), rank().over(window2))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, the new part will extract ``rank().over(window1)`` and add a separate window node to the plan. All other expressions will stay as they are. Next, the existing case will add another window operation to the plan based on ``rank().over(window2)``. The result will look like: \r\n\r\n```\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nsum(a): bigint, max(RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$())): int, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY max(a) ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$()): int\r\nProject [sum(a)#20L, max(RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$()))#21, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY max(a) ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$())#22]\r\n+- Project [sum(a)#20L, max(RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$()))#21, _w0#59, _w1#63, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY max(a) ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$())#22, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY max(a) ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$())#22]\r\n   +- Window [rank(_w1#63) windowspecdefinition(_w1#63 ASC NULLS FIRST, specifiedwindowframe(RowFrame, unboundedpreceding$(), currentrow$())) AS RANK() OVER (ORDER BY max(a) ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$())#22], [_w1#63 ASC NULLS FIRST]\r\n      +- Aggregate [sum(cast(a#5 as bigint)) AS sum(a)#20L, max(_we0#52) AS max(RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$()))#21, max(a#5) AS _w0#59, max(a#5) AS _w1#63]\r\n         +- Project [a#5, b#6, _we0#52, _we0#52]\r\n            +- Window [rank(a#5) windowspecdefinition(a#5 ASC NULLS FIRST, specifiedwindowframe(RowFrame, unboundedpreceding$(), currentrow$())) AS _we0#52], [a#5 ASC NULLS FIRST]\r\n               +- Project [_1#2 AS a#5, _2#3 AS b#6]\r\n                  +- LocalRelation [_1#2, _2#3]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nProject [sum(a)#20L, max(RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$()))#21, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY max(a) ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$())#22]\r\n+- Window [rank(_w1#63) windowspecdefinition(_w1#63 ASC NULLS FIRST, specifiedwindowframe(RowFrame, unboundedpreceding$(), currentrow$())) AS RANK() OVER (ORDER BY max(a) ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$())#22], [_w1#63 ASC NULLS FIRST]\r\n   +- Aggregate [sum(cast(a#5 as bigint)) AS sum(a)#20L, max(_we0#52) AS max(RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$()))#21, max(a#5) AS _w1#63]\r\n      +- Project [a#5, _we0#52, _we0#52]\r\n         +- Window [rank(a#5) windowspecdefinition(a#5 ASC NULLS FIRST, specifiedwindowframe(RowFrame, unboundedpreceding$(), currentrow$())) AS _we0#52], [a#5 ASC NULLS FIRST]\r\n            +- LocalRelation [a#5]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Open Questions\r\n\r\nThere is a question about the logical meaning and expected result of the next query:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    val df = Seq((1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (5, 5)).toDF(\"a\", \"b\")\r\n    val window = Window.orderBy(\"a\")\r\n    df.groupBy('a).agg(sum('a), max('a), max(rank().over(window))).show(false)\r\n\r\n+---+------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|a  |sum(a)|max(a)|max(RANK() OVER (ORDER BY a ASC NULLS FIRST unspecifiedframe$()))|\r\n+---+------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|1  |2     |1     |1                                                                |\r\n|2  |2     |2     |3                                                                |\r\n|5  |5     |5     |4                                                                |\r\n+---+------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, the new part will ignore the grouping to compute ``max(rank().over(window))``, which feels like a mistake. Am I right? What is expected in this case?\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR represents a prototype and contains a test that did not work previously.","created_at":"2017-09-11T16:39:35Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T18:37:36Z","closed_at":"2018-09-13T18:31:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5af3372a27661a991188a6daf64942541cb35b48","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19193/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19193/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19193/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb19ad614b7b757b71e6995aa0c5d8295d8f2485","head":{"label":"aokolnychyi:spark-21896","ref":"spark-21896","sha":"cb19ad614b7b757b71e6995aa0c5d8295d8f2485","user":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61945043,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTk0NTA0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"aokolnychyi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aokolnychyi","id":6235869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzU4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6235869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi","html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aokolnychyi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aokolnychyi/spark","description":"Mirror

being opened\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn UnsafeExternalSorter::getIterator(), for every spillWriter a file is opened in UnsafeSorterSpillReader and these files get closed later point in time as a part of close() call. \r\nHowever, when large number of spill files are present, number of files opened increases to a great extent and ends up throwing \"Too many files\" open exception.\r\nThis can easily be reproduced with TPC-DS Q67 at 1 TB scale in multi node cluster with multiple cores per executor. \r\n\r\nThere are ways to reduce the number of spill files that are generated in Q67. E.g, increase \"spark.sql.windowExec.buffer.spill.threshold\" where 4096 is the default. Another option is to increase ulimit to much higher values.\r\nBut those are workarounds. \r\n\r\nThis PR reduces the number of files that are kept open at in UnsafeSorterSpillReader.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManual testing of Q67 in 1 TB and 10 TB scale on multi node cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-11T01:48:35Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T08:01:42Z","closed_at":"2017-09-27T08:01:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"29b3e4ad1f1595e1114a765180e1ec66bb3d5ebf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19184/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19184/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19184/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea5f9d9903185690670da6384dbd6d2b08b8177f","head":{"label":"rajeshbalamohan:SPARK-21971","ref":"SPARK-21971","sha":"ea5f9d9903185690670da6384dbd6d2b08b8177f","user":{"login":"rajeshbalamohan","id":323339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzMzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan","html_url":"https://github.com/rajeshbalamohan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":49923428,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0OTkyMzQyOA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rajeshbalamohan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rajeshbalamohan","id":323339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzMzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan","html_url":"https://github.com/rajeshbalamohan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajeshbalamohan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rajeshbalamohan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nRemoves check that `spark.executor.instances` is set to 0 when using Streaming DRA.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests\r\n\r\nMy only concern with this PR is that `spark.executor.instances` (or the actual initial number of executors that the cluster manager gives Spark) can be outside of `spark.streaming.dynamicAllocation.minExecutors` to `spark.streaming.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors`. I don't see a good way around that, because this code only runs after the SparkContext has been created.","created_at":"2017-09-10T22:24:46Z","updated_at":"2018-07-27T17:22:46Z","closed_at":"2018-07-27T17:22:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6087532ea13e871554b72dfe6acc12f0dda1e528","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19183/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19183/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19183/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4c9769e232a5d028f48235260bde682a1d3b059a","head":{"label":"karth295:master","ref":"master","sha":"4c9769e232a5d028f48235260bde682a1d3b059a","user":{"login":"karth295","id":5653442,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTM0NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5653442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295","html_url":"https://github.com/karth295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86391381,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NjM5MTM4MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"karth295/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"karth295","id":5653442,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTM0NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5653442?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295","html_url":"https://github.com/karth295","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/karth295/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/karth295/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n* Using 64 bit unsigned long comparison instead of unsigned int comparison in `org.apache.spark.unsafe.types.UTF8String#compareTo` for better performance.\r\n* Making `IS_LITTLE_ENDIAN` a constant for correctness reasons (shouldn't use a non-constant in `compareTo` implementations and it def. is a constant per JVM)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBuild passes and the functionality is widely covered by existing tests as far as I can

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21964\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation for grouping analytics (i.e., cube, rollup and grouping sets) is \"heavyweight\" for many scenarios (e.g., high dimensions cube), as the Expand operator produces a large number of projections, resulting vast shuffle write.  It may result into low performance or even OOM issues for direct buffer memory.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides another choice which enables splitting the heavyweight aggregate into a number of lightweight aggregates for each group. Actually, it implements the grouping analytics as Union and executes the aggregates one by one. \r\n\r\nThis optimization is opposite to the general sense of \"avoding redundant data scan\". However, it can achieve overall high performance for many cases. In our production environment, about 500+ queries can get benefit from it. \r\n\r\nThe current splitting strategy is simple as one aggregation for one group. In future, we may figure out more intelligent splitting stategies (e.g., cost-based method).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests\r\nManual tests in production

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFilter out BlockStatus update data in logs when replaying. If the accumulable name matches the accumulableBlacklist, they will be filtered out. In this case, no more BlockStatus objects will be created in Spark History Server. SPARK-20084 adds a function called \"accumulablesToJson\", this patch adds a function called \"accumulablesFromJson\" to match.\r\n\r\nRemove the manual added BlockStatus updates in Unit test to pass the unit test.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test passed after the unit test change.\r\nDeployed in our production cluster, memory consumption drops a lot. Less than 5 short term Full GC happened when replaying more than 4K history logs, which has logs generated from 1.6.x and 2.1.0.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`JacksonUtils.verifySchema` verifies if a data type can be converted to JSON. For `MapType`, it now verifies the key type. However, in `JacksonGenerator`, when converting a map to JSON, we only care about its values and create a writer for the values. The keys in a map are treated as strings by calling `toString` on the keys.\r\n\r\nThus, we should change `JacksonUtils.verifySchema` to verify the value type of `MapType`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-08T08:28:06Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:55Z","closed_at":"2017-09-09T10:13:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"86a7913706bde983564aac528e9f7886ecbf9991","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fbf8a88ba76e03602d82060b982038ddb53b43df","head":{"label":"viirya:test-jacksonutils","ref":"test-jacksonutils","sha":"fbf8a88ba76e03602d82060b982038ddb53b43df","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change allows the user to specify the maximum no. of tasks running in a given job group. (Kindly see the jira comments section for more context on why this is implemented at a job group level rather than a stage level). This change is beneficial where the user wants to avoid having a DoS while trying to access an eternal service from multiple executors without having the need to repartition or coalesce existing RDDs.\r\n\r\nThis code change introduces a new user level configuration: `spark.job.[userJobGroup].maxConcurrentTasks` which is used to set the active no. of tasks executing at a given point in time.\r\n\r\nThe user can use the feature by setting the appropriate jobGroup and passing the conf:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconf.set(\"spark.job.group1.maxConcurrentTasks\", \"10\")\r\n...\r\nsc.setJobGroup(\"group1\", \"\", false)\r\nsc.parallelize(1 to 100000, 10).map(x => x + 1).count\r\nsc.clearJobGroup\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### changes proposed in this fix \r\nThis change limits the no. of tasks (in turn also the no. of executors to be acquired) than can run simultaneously in a given job group and its subsequent job/s and stage/s if the appropriate job group and max concurrency configs are set.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan unit tests and multiple manual tests with various combinations of:\r\n- single/multiple/no job groups\r\n- executors with single/multi cores\r\n- dynamic allocation on/off\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-07T18:43:46Z","updated_at":"2017-09-11T16:47:56Z","closed_at":"2017-09-11T16:47:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"512c1cd80e8def232cbd797e83aff1f780631f50","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19157/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19157/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19157/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8b3830004d69bd5f109fd9846f59583c23a910c7","head":{"label":"dhruve:impr/SPARK-20589","ref":"impr/SPARK-20589","sha":"8b3830004d69bd5f109fd9846f59583c23a910c7","user":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54914940,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDkxNDk0MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dhruve/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruve","id":7732317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3MzIzMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7732317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruve/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruve/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMake several improvements in dataframe vectorized summarizer.\r\n\r\n1. Make the summarizer return `Vector` type for all metrics (except \"count\").\r\nIt will return \"WrappedArray\" type before which won't be very convenient.\r\n\r\n2. Make `MetricsAggregate` inherit `ImplicitCastInputTypes` trait. So it can check and implicitly cast input values.\r\n\r\n3. Add \"weight\" parameter for all single metric method.\r\n\r\n4. Update doc and improve the example code in doc.\r\n\r\n5. Simplified test cases.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest added and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n**The problem:** \r\n\r\n`DiskBlockManager` has a notion of a \"scratch\" local folder(s), which can be configured via `spark.local.dir` option, and which defaults to the system's `/tmp`. The hierarchy is two-level, e.g. `/blockmgr-XXX.../YY`, where the `YY` part is a hash bit, to spread files evenly. \r\n\r\nFunction `DiskBlockManager.getFile` _expects_ the top level directories (`blockmgr-XXX...`) to always exist (they get created once, when the spark context is first created), otherwise it would fail with a message like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n... java.io.IOException: Failed to create local dir in /tmp/blockmgr-XXX.../YY\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this may not always be the case, in particular if it's the default `/tmp` folder - on certain operating systems it can be cleaned on a regular basis (e.g. once per day via a system cron job). \r\n\r\nThe symptom is that after the process using spark is running for a while (a few days), it may not be able to load files anymore, since the top-level scratch directories are not there and `DiskBlockManager.getFile` crashes.\r\n\r\nThe change/mitigation is simple: use `File.mkdirs` instead of `File.mkdir` inside `getFile`, so that we create the _full path_ there, which will handle the case that parent directory is not there anymore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have added a falsifying unit test inside `DiskBlockManagerSuite`, which gets fixed via this patch.","created_at":"2017-09-07T07:29:47Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T08:55:14Z","closed_at":"2017-09-13T08:55:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"133dfaf6c4737ebb0f3814fa7c06a6bb0986c9dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dc502493c8c5cde03ba4dc1ce8391e176c583267","head":{"label":"rshest:fix-DiskBlockManager-local-root-removed","ref":"fix-DiskBlockManager-local-root-removed","sha":"dc502493c8c5cde03ba4dc1ce8391e176c583267","user":{"login":"rshest","id":495813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/495813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest","html_url":"https://github.com/rshest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102612595,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDI2MTI1OTU=","name":"spark","full_name":"rshest/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rshest","id":495813,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTgxMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/495813?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest","html_url":"https://github.com/rshest","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rshest/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rshest/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe optimizer rule `InferFiltersFromConstraints` could trigger our batch  `Operator Optimizations` exceeds the max iteration limit (i.e., 100) so that the final plan might not be properly optimized. The rule `InferFiltersFromConstraints` could conflict with the other Filter/Join predicate reduction rules. Thus, we need to separate `InferFiltersFromConstraints` from the other rules. \r\n\r\nThis PR is to separate `InferFiltersFromConstraints ` from the main batch `Operator Optimizations` .\r\n\r\n## How

When creating tables, `HiveExternalCatalog` converts the table metadata to hive table format and save into hive metastore.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis pr introduces vectorized UDFs in Python.\r\nNote that this pr should focus on APIs for vectorized UDFs, not APIs for vectorized UDAFs or Window operations.\r\n\r\n**Proposed API**\r\n\r\nWe introduce a `@pandas_udf` decorator (or annotation) to define vectorized UDFs which takes one or more `pandas.Series` or one integer value meaning the length of the input value for 0-parameter UDFs. The return value should be `pandas.Series` of the specified type and the length of the returned value should be the same as input value.\r\n\r\nWe can define vectorized UDFs as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n  @pandas_udf(DoubleType())\r\n  def plus(v1, v2):\r\n      return v1 + v2\r\n```\r\n\r\nor we can define as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n  plus = pandas_udf(lambda v1, v2: v1 + v2, DoubleType())\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can use it similar to row-by-row UDFs:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n  df.withColumn('sum', plus(df.v1, df.v2))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for 0-parameter UDFs, we can define and use

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nWhen the libraries temp directory(i.e. __spark_libs__*.zip dir) file system and staging dir(destination) file systems are the same then the __spark_libs__*.zip is not copying to the staging directory. But after making this decision the libraries zip file is getting deleted immediately and becoming unavailable for the Node Manager's localization. \r\n\r\nWith this change, client copies the files to remote always when the source scheme is \"file\".\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have verified it manually in yarn/cluster and yarn/client modes with hdfs and local file systems.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-06T00:26:07Z","updated_at":"2017-09-20T23:25:15Z","closed_at":"2017-09-20T23:25:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"392fc3ee00ffad26ca57e00e1445dc319ea4fd02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19141/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19141/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19141/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d2d13fe82aec1c0fc43d688dbd315385ef99be19","head":{"label":"devaraj-kavali:SPARK-21384","ref":"SPARK-21384","sha":"d2d13fe82aec1c0fc43d688dbd315385ef99be19","user":{"login":"devaraj-kavali","id":3174804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3174804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali","html_url":"https://github.com/devaraj-kavali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20208591,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDIwODU5MQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"devaraj-kavali/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"devaraj-kavali","id":3174804,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNzQ4MDQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3174804?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali","html_url":"https://github.com/devaraj-kavali","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/devaraj-kavali/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/devaraj-kavali/spark","description":"Mirror

why it fails on secure grid:\r\nOozie client gets the necessary tokens the application needs before launching. It passes those tokens along to the oozie launcher job (MR job) which will then actually call the Spark client to launch the spark app and pass the tokens along.\r\nThe oozie launcher job cannot get anymore tokens because all it has is tokens ( you can't get tokens with tokens, you need tgt or keytab).\r\nThe error here is because the launcher job runs the Spark Client to submit the spark job but the spark client doesn't see that it already has the hdfs tokens so it tries to get more, which ends with the exception.\r\nThere was a change with SPARK-19021 to generalize the hdfs credentials provider that changed it so we don't pass the existing credentials into the call to get tokens so it doesn't realize it already has the necessary

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen Spark persist data to Unsafe memory, we call  the method `MemoryStore.putIteratorAsBytes`, which need synchronize the `memoryManager` for every

This implementation is not necessary, we can apply for more memory at a time to reduce unnecessary synchronization.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTest case (with 1 executor 20

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen driver quit abnormally which cause executor shutdown and task metrics can not be sent to driver for updating.In this case the status will always be 'RUNNING' and the duration on history UI will be 'CurrentTime - launchTime' which increase infinitely.\r\nWe can fix this time by modify time of event log since this time has gotten when `FSHistoryProvider` fetch event log from File System.\r\nAnd the result picture is uploaded in [SPARK-21922](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-21922).\r\nHow to reproduce?\r\n(1) Submit a job to spark on yarn\r\n(2) Mock an oom(or other case can make driver quit abnormally)  senario for driver\r\n(3) Make sure executor is running task when driver quitting\r\n(4) Open the history server and checkout result\r\nIt is not a corner case since there are many such jobs in our current cluster.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nDeploy historyserver and open a job has this problem.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-05T10:45:38Z","updated_at":"2017-09-25T12:07:30Z","closed_at":"2017-09-14T12:43:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c91d710693d41c38b76fcc41c4c15db436cfaf7a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19132/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19132/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19132/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06035f7cd637511a01d3e9dc04c1d6f78afc27cc","head":{"label":"caneGuy:zhoukang/fix-duration","ref":"zhoukang/fix-duration","sha":"06035f7cd637511a01d3e9dc04c1d6f78afc27cc","user":{"login":"caneGuy","id":26762018,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzYyMDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26762018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy","html_url":"https://github.com/caneGuy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96277831,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjI3NzgzMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"caneGuy/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"caneGuy","id":26762018,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NzYyMDE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26762018?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy","html_url":"https://github.com/caneGuy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/caneGuy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/caneGuy/spark","description":"Mirror

To fix this problem, here propose to download remote http(s) resources to local and add this local downloaded resources to dist cache. This solution has one downside: remote resources are downloaded and uploaded again, but it only restricted to only remote http(s) resources, also the overhead is not so big. The advantages of this solution is that it is simple and the code changes restricts to only `SparkSubmit`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test added, also verified in local

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn current code, we set `isolationOn=!isCliSession()` when create hive client for metadata. However conf of `CliSessionState` points to local dummy metastore(https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/hive/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/hive/HiveUtils.scala#L416). Using `CliSessionState`, we fail to get metadata from remote hive metastore.
