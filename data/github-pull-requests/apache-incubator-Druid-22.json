Description\r\n\r\nFor SQL functions accepting literals, casting might be allowed or disallowed, depending on whether the `OperandTypes.LITERAL` checker is used. Using it disallows casted literals like - `CAST(100 AS INTEGER`.\r\nWhile this was an acceptable limitation as there's no use of casting a literal that the user has entered, the issue arises due to the Calcite upgrade, where the new JDBC client can't allow wildcards without an explicit cast. Therefore for a function with a signature like `FUNC(column, literal)`, we can't do the following in JDBC.\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT FUNC(column, ?) FROM foo\r\n```\r\nInstead, we'd have to work around it using\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT FUNC(column, CAST(? AS TYPE)) FROM foo\r\n```\r\nBut the second query doesn't play nice if the `FUNC` uses `OperandTypes.LITERAL`. Therefore this PR allows cast in such functions by modifying the signature to not rely on `OperandTypes.LITERAL`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also marks `OperandTypes.LITERAL` in forbidden-apis so that the user cannot use the `LITERAL` checker (until JDBC behavior is reverted, if it would).\r\n`BasicOperandTypeChecker` is removed and the `DefaultOperandTypeChecker` is the only checker around.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFunctions that accept literals also allow casted literals. This shouldn't have an impact on the queries that the user writes. It enables the SQL functions to accept explicit cast, which is required with JDBC.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR adds a new duty to clean up non-overlapping eternity tombstones. The candidate segments must fit all the criteria:\r\n- It is a tombstone that starts at `-INF` or ends at `INF` and\r\n- It does not overlap with any used overshadowed segment in the snapshot\r\n- It has has 0 core partitions. Candidate tombstones with 1 partition generated prior to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15379 need to be manually cleaned up as it can cause data loss if removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe algorithm to determine these tombstones is as follows:\r\n- Determine the set of used and non-overshadowed segments from the used segments' timeline\r\n-  For each such candidate segment that is a tombstone that starts at `-INF` or ends at `INF`, look at the set of overshadowed used segments to see if at least one of the intervals overlaps with the candidate segment.\r\n- If there is no overlap, then the candidate segment is a segment eligible to be marked as unused \r\n\r\nThis is a companion change to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15243.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nA new duty, `MarkEternityTombstonesAsUnused`, is added to clean up non-overlapping eternity tombstones - tombstone segments that either start at `-INF` or end at `INF` and has no overlap with any overshadowed used segment in the datasource. A metric `segment/unneededEternityTombstone/count` is emitted that counts the number of dropped non-overshadowed eternity tombstones per datasource.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `MarkEternityTombstonesAsUnused.java`\r\n * `MarkEternityTombstonesAsUnusedTest.java`\r\n * Misc typos fixed in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/15281/commits/d3adbf562be2d7e646c794f6761b85ccc064a2aa\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Following is a summary of the changes:\r\n- Replaced iceberg spark runtime dependency with `iceberg-core` and `iceberg-parquet` for tests\r\n- Excluded `hive-serde` and replaced it with `hive-common` for runtime scope\r\n- Bunch of transitive dependency exclusions.\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

changes:\r\n\r\n1) The `SystemField` enum defines system fields `__file_uri`, `__file_path`,\r\n   and `__file_bucket`. They are associated with each input entity.\r\n\r\n2) The `SystemFieldInputSource` interface can be added to any InputSource\r\n   to make it system-field-capable. It sets up serialization of a list\r\n   of configured `systemFields` in the JSON form of the input source, and\r\n   provides a method getSystemFieldValue for computing the value of each\r\n   system field. Cloud object, HDFS, HTTP, and Local now have this.\r\n\r\nThe `SystemFieldInputSource` isn't strictly necessary, since each input source could have implemented system fields internally in its own way. However, I think the interface is valuable because it helps ensure system fields are dealt with consistently, and because it provides a path to exposing system fields in SQL in a nice way. I think that ideally, they would be referenceable by name, but not participate in star expansion. AFAICT this would require a new Calcite feature. Relevant Calcite mailing list thread: https://lists.apache.org/thread/pnf3bx3jlrmv7q1q7jhwhsylrw4q5t20\r\n\r\nUntil then, system fields can be used in SQL without the planner's awareness: with `EXTERN`, add `systemFields` to the `inputSource` section, and add the system field names to the `signature` section.","created_at":"2023-10-30T05:58:20Z","updated_at":"2024-01-29T07:46:14Z","closed_at":"2023-11-02T17:31:29Z","merged_at":"2023-11-02T17:31:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"d87d92bc436da4d30e4e54b80c97b0251173084f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Fixes flaky test _org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.ParametrizedUriEmitterTest#testEmitterWithMultipleFeeds_\r\n#### ID: #15198\r\n\r\n#### Problem: \r\n```shell\r\njava.lang.AssertionError:

Equality of two maps, containing the same keys (strings) and values (strings). These values are JSON-String. JSON strings are not unique – they are considered equal if they contain the same elements without taking care of the order of the elements on the same level. The current assertion leads to a flaky test.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\nTo fix this, the strings are getting parsed using the Jackson library and compared to remove the flakiness. \r\n\r\n#### To reproduce run\r\n```shell\r\nmvn -pl processing edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.ParametrizedUriEmitterTest#testEmitterWithMultipleFeeds\r\n``` \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Fixes flaky tests _org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest#testSanityWithGeneralizedCreation_ , test _org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest#testSanity_ , _org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest#testGzipContentEncoding_\r\n#### ID: #15199, #15200, #15201\r\n\r\n#### Problem: \r\n```shell\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<[{\"[metrics\":{\"value\":1},\"feed\":\"test\"]},{\"feed\":\"test\",\"me...> but was:<[{\"[feed\":\"test\",\"metrics\":{\"value\":1}]},{\"feed\":\"test\",\"me...>\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThese tests check for a specific ordering of elements in a JSON string.

Description\r\n\r\nServiceClientImpl logs the cause of every retry, even though we are retrying the connection attempt. This leads to slight pollution in the logs because a lot of the time, the reason for retrying is the same. This is seen primarily in MSQ, when the worker task hasn't launched yet however controller attempts to connect to the worker task, which can lead to scary-looking messages (with `INFO` log level), even though they are normal.\r\nThis PR changes the logging logic to log every 10 (arbitrary number) retries instead of every retry, to reduce the pollution of the logs. \r\nNote: If there are no retries left, the client returns an exception, which would get thrown up by the caller, and therefore this change doesn't hide any important information. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Run the test in regular runs\r\n     ```\r\n    mvn -pl extensions-core/parquet-extensions test -Dtest=org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.TimestampsParquetReaderTest#testDateHandling\r\n    ```\r\n3. The test failed by running the test with Non-Dex tool.\r\n    ```\r\n    mvn -pl extensions-core/parquet-extensions edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dcheckstyle.skip -Dtest=org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.TimestampsParquetReaderTest#testDateHandling\r\n    ```\r\nThe following error is noticed:\r\n```console\r\n[ERROR] Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 3.204 s <<< FAILURE! -- in org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.TimestampsParquetReaderTest\r\n[ERROR] org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.TimestampsParquetReaderTest.testDateHandling -- Time elapsed: 0.188 s <<< FAILURE!\r\norg.junit.ComparisonFailure: \r\nexpected:<... : \"2017-06-18\",\r\n  \"[timestamp_as_timestamp\" : 1497702471815,\r\n  \"timestamp_as_string\" : \"2017-06-17 14:27:51.815\",\r\n  \"idx\" : 1,\r\n  \"date_as_date\" : 1497744000000]\r\n}> but was:<... : \"2017-06-18\",\r\n  \"[idx\" : 1,\r\n  \"timestamp_as_timestamp\" : 1497702471815,\r\n  \"date_as_date\" : 1497744000000,\r\n  \"timestamp_as_string\" : \"2017-06-17 14:27:51.815\"]\r\n}>\r\n        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:117)\r\n        at org.junit.Assert.assertEquals(Assert.java:146)\r\n        at org.apache.druid.data.input.parquet.TimestampsParquetReaderTest.testDateHandling(TimestampsParquetReaderTest.java:99)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Reason of flakiness:**\r\nThe test checks the equality of two JSON strings. The data reading method used `createReader()` in the test do not retrieve data in a consistent order, which can possibly lead to different JSON representations of the same data during test runs.\r\n\r\n**Changes:**\r\n- Imported `fasterxml.jackson` package, and changed from using standard assertion method `Assert` to using `JSONNode` and `ObjectMapper`, which parse two JSON strings and convert them to a tree structure and each node in the trees are compared. Thus, the order of the elements in JSON strings is deterministic and the test passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

docker image build issues with apache/druid.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nCurrently, trying to build the docker image fails with the following error when trying to grab the static bash utils.\r\n```\r\n#16 0.263 wget: note: TLS certificate validation not implemented\r\n#16 0.297 wget: TLS error from peer (alert code 80): 80\r\n#16 0.297 wget: error getting response: Connection reset by peer\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be caused by a SSL validation issue in busybox (it seems to happen for github.com but not google.com). I thought this might be fixed by moving to busybox 1.35.0, but I got the same error.\r\n\r\nTo get this working, I moved the wget commands to another setup layer and copied the file into the distroless build.\r\n\r\nIt seems like it would be better to switch to busybox 1.35.0 anyways (there is a critical CVE: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48174), although we technically just use the image for the setup tools, not sure if the CVE actually affects us), but the issue with switching to busybox 1.35.0 is that we get the build errors that were described in this pr: https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14518\r\n\r\nThis can be remediated by also upgrading the distroless image to debian12, but there is no java11-debian12 distroless image, only a java17-debian12 image.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know druid supports java17 as a target now so maybe this would be okay? I can make that change if people think it makes sense.\r\n\r\nI tested the new image and it ran fine.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nFix druid docker image\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `distribution/docker/Dockerfile`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [ ] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [X] been tested in a test Druid

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Fixes flaky test _org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.ParametrizedUriEmitterTest#testEmitterWithMultipleFeeds_\r\n#### ID: #15198\r\n\r\n#### Problem: \r\n```shell\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: \r\nexpected:<{http://example.com/test1=[{\"metrics\":{\"value\":1},\"feed\":\"test1\"}]\r\n, http://example.com/test2=[{\"metrics\":{\"value\":2},\"feed\":\"test2\"}]\r\n}> but

Equality of two maps, containing the same keys (strings) and values (strings). These values are JSON-String. JSON strings are not unique – they are considered equal if they contain the same elements without taking care of the order of the elements on the same level. The current assertion leads to a flaky test.\r\n\r\n#### Solution\r\nTo fix this, the strings are getting parsed using the Jackson library and compared to remove the flakiness. \r\n\r\n#### To reproduce run\r\n```shell\r\nmvn -pl processing edu.illinois:nondex-maven-plugin:2.1.1:nondex -Dtest=org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.ParametrizedUriEmitterTest#testEmitterWithMultipleFeeds\r\n``` \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n### Fixes flaky tests _org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest#testSanityWithGeneralizedCreation_ , test _org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest#testSanity_ , _org.apache.druid.java.util.emitter.core.EmitterTest#testGzipContentEncoding_\r\n#### ID: #15199, #15200, #15201\r\n\r\n#### Problem: \r\n```shell\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: org.junit.ComparisonFailure: expected:<[{\"[metrics\":{\"value\":1},\"feed\":\"test\"]},{\"feed\":\"test\",\"me...> but was:<[{\"[feed\":\"test\",\"metrics\":{\"value\":1}]},{\"feed\":\"test\",\"me...>\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThese tests check for a specific ordering of elements in a JSON string.

NPE caused by realtime segment closing race, fix possible missing-segment retry bug.\r\n\r\nFixes #12168, by returning empty from FireHydrant when the segment is swapped to null. This causes the SinkQuerySegmentWalker to use ReportTimelineMissingSegmentQueryRunner, which causes the Broker to look for the segment somewhere else.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this patch changes SinkQuerySegmentWalker to acquire references to all hydrants (subsegments of a sink) at once, and return a ReportTimelineMissingSegmentQueryRunner if *any* of them could not be acquired. I suspect, although have not confirmed, that the prior behavior could lead to segments being reported as missing even though results from some hydrants were still

is to use the latest datasketches-java version 4.2.0.\r\nThis was supposed to be a minor version change, but inadvertently some API changes were introduced. Therefore I had to implement a few new required methods in the custom ArrayOfStringTuplesSerDe. They will need a careful review since I am not entirely sure I understood the serial format correctly.\r\nAlso one test is currently failing. I don’t understand the purpose of this test. It is called preservesMinAndMaxWhenAssumeGroupedFalse. I have no idea what does this mean. However it asks a quantile sketch to partition 66 items into 66 partitions and expects exactly one item in each. If we allow even slightest error (and sketches are approximate) we can get some partitions with 2 items and some empty ones. So with deduplication it leads to fewer partitions.\r\nThis change in behavior from 4.1.0 to 4.2.0 is unfortunate, but not incorrect. This is a degenerate use case. I would think that a better test could generate, say, 1000 items, ask for 10 partitions and assert that partitions have 100+-2 items or something like that. Perhaps this behavior with very small partitions can be improved in the next version, but for now I would suggest using 4.2.0 and changing this test somehow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-25T17:16:58Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T23:28:37Z","closed_at":"2023-10-26T23:28:33Z","merged_at":"2023-10-26T23:28:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1132d20c5756c35b26f5ad43008158c105dcd3f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

Description\r\nThis PR attempts to:\r\n* more clearly lay out the differences between `ARRAY` types and multi-value dimensions in the docs\r\n* adds a new arrays page with examples and concepts\r\n* updates the multi-value dimensions page to call out that they are not arrays and include SQL examples\r\n* document the new `arrayIngestMode` parameter added in #15093\r\n* and update MSQ examples to show how to ingest ARRAY types and MVDs going forward to prepare for the eventual default of `\"arrayIngestMode\":\"array\"`\r\n\r\nIt also adds a new `outputType` to `ExpressionPostAggregator` which is used by the SQL planner to decorate the postagg with the expected output type, particularly useful when using functions like `ARRAY_TO_MV`, which has a native expression type of `ARRAY<STRING>` but is expected to be treated as `STRING` outside of expressions (multi-value `STRING` do not exist inside of expression engine, so native expression type-inference alone isn't quite cool enough to handle this properly). This was necessary to make the new docs actually true.","created_at":"2023-10-25T03:54:16Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T07:31:40Z","closed_at":"2023-11-02T07:31:37Z","merged_at":"2023-11-02T07:31:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"d261587f4afcc516410038571ddaf2038bdb171f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":82655274,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjY1NTI3NA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Documentation","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

The Json object data that get by request is non-deterministic.

native batch ingestion, MSQ is strict about segment allocation --  it will throw an `InsertCannotAllocateSegment` [fault](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/multi-stage-query/reference#error-codes) if the requested segment granularity  doesn't align with the allocated segment granularity. \r\n\r\nThis patch modifies the segment generation logic in MSQ `REPLACE` to:\r\n- Honor the segment granularity specified in the query for all finite-interval tombstones upto 5000 segments (`Limits.MAX_PARTITION_BUCKETS`) - e.g., `[2000, 2010)`. Once the limit exceeds, a `TooManyBucketsFault` fault is returned similar to data segments.\r\n- For infinite-interval tombstones, retain the current behavior of generating one tombstone each for positive and negative eternity - e.g., `[-Inf, 2000)`, `[2010, Inf)`.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is consistent with how MSQ generally works re honoring segment granularity in the query. It's also similar to how native batch ingestion generates tombstones.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be!

The new code only treats the infinite interval ones special, which will be cleaned up by the coordinator in a follow up change.\r\n\r\nThis change semi-reverts https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/13893/, uses the tests added in the PR and adds a new condition to account for the infinite-interval tombstones.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing.

AggregateRemoveRule removes the aggregates and plans the query as a scan over a group by subquery with ordering on a non-time column which Druid does not support atm. In this PR we fix planning by removing the Aggregate remove rule which plans these queries as scan over group by with order by on a non-time column which Druid does not support.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Removal of this rule is the worst case fix for this case. The best case would have been to allow druid to order by on non-time columns. With removal of this rule which would have removed the aggregate from the outer query if the same is present in the inner query we'll see some performance regression for those queries. However with this we ensure that everything in Druid works as same before the Calcite upgrade from 1.21 to 1.35.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [ ] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Doing it this way also ensures that they only exist as long as they are needed, and is already where we close the mapped buffers, so should be adequate.\r\n\r\nThere is another problem in that this (and incremental segment merging) are using `java.io.tmpdir` rather than the task temporary storage location, however I will fix those issues in a separate PR.

PR suppresses the following CVE's\r\n\r\n* CVE-2023-44487 - Suppressing the CVE since it hasn't been fixed in the latest version of Hadoop\r\n* CVE-2020-28458 - Pretty old CVE that was suppressed using` <vulnerabilityName>` already, however, it was popping up while trying to build the artifact.\r\n* CVE-2023-5072 - Affects `json-java` that neither Druid nor any of its dependency is using (verified using `mvn dependency:tree`. False positive, looks like the CPE identifier is too generic that it is flagging JARs with json- in their name\r\n* CVE-2023-44981 - Genuine CVE, this should be resolved once we upgrade ZK, since the ZK version Druid is using doesn't have a patch for this CVE. This seems to affect ZK servers, and Druid uses that in quickstart/docker-compose. In production, users are supposed to use their own ZK (containing a later & patched version of ZK), with which the client libraries Druid is using would be

#14514 \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCurrently `advance` function in postJoinCursor calls `advanceUninterruptibly` which in turn keeps calling `baseCursor.advanceUninterruptibly` until the post join condition matches, without checking for interrupts. This causes the CPU to hit 100% without getting a chance for query to be cancelled. \r\n\r\nWith this change, the call flow of `advance` and `advanceUninterruptibly` is separated out so that they call `baseCursor.advance` and `baseCursor.advanceUninterruptibly` in them, respectively, giving a chance for interrupts in the former case between successive calls to `baseCursor.advance`.","created_at":"2023-10-20T18:01:12Z","updated_at":"2023-10-30T09:09:16Z","closed_at":"2023-10-30T09:09:15Z","merged_at":"2023-10-30T09:09:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"a27598a487a9edbe0ce7d094ccaf1bf515958a2b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":648734860,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2NDg3MzQ4NjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Format%20and%20Ser/De","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

#10817.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nAdded a SQL function to match IPv6 addresses to a given subnet. This was based off the existing `IPv4_MATCH` function. I initially considered changing the existing `IPv4_MATCH` function to be a more generic (e.g. `IP_MATCH`). However, given this has been a function for some time I thought it best to keep the existing function for existing queries and make an IPv6 specific implementation. Like the existing IPv4 implementation, this relies on the Java `inet.ipaddr` library\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n\r\nAdded `IPv6_MATCH` SQL function for matching IPv6 addresses in a subnet\r\n\r\n##### Key added classes in this PR\r\n * `IPv6AddressExprUtils`\r\n * `IPv6AddressMatchExprMacro`\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR.

See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are a committer, follow the PR action item checklist for committers:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/committer-instructions.md#pr-and-issue-action-item-checklist-for-committers. -->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I am proposing a fix for a flaky test identified in `org.apache.druid.storage.s3.S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest.testSerialization`.\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, and what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\nThe mentioned test compares two strings. An `ObjectMapper` variable is being leveraged to carry out the serialization and deserialization process. The serialization process internally leverages a `getDeclaredFields()` function. As per [Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getDeclaredFields--),\r\n> The elements in the returned array are not sorted and are not in any particular order.\r\n\r\nBecause of the elements being returned in inconsistent orders, the toString() generates a string that might not adhere to the expected pattern during multiple executions. \r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\nThe test is intended to evaluate the serialization of the concerned class. The value generated after the serialization process is a JSON string. When comparing two JSON strings, precedence should be given to evaluating the correctness of key:value pairs rather than the hardcoded strings.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome this problem,  I am proposing to use a HashMap to deserialize the strings before they are compared. The usage of HashMap before the comparison occurs shifts the focus of test validation to evaluating the key-value pairs rather than the order in which they are serialized.\r\n\r\nThe current lines of code are shown below:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/krishnanand5/druid/blob/ad32f8458670339808a3136a9578a10a52b8394f/extensions-core/s3-extensions/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/storage/s3/S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest.java#L44-L45\r\n\r\nThe following lines of code, if replaced, help in addressing the flakiness seen in this test:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/krishnanand5/druid/blob/864bb43f73cb06488c6dd62cc5df462643168770/extensions-core/s3-extensions/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/storage/s3/S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest.java#L47-L50\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\nI used an open-source tool called [NonDex](https://github.com/TestingResearchIllinois/NonDex) to detect the flaky test. After checking in my changes, I executed the nondex tool on the particular test to confirm that the flakiness was indeed resolved. \r\n\r\nError that was seen on Nondex:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] Failures: \r\n        [ERROR] orgpw.apache.druid.storage.s3.S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest.testSerialization\r\n        [ERROR]   Run 1: S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest.testSerialization:45 expected:<{\"[bucket\":\"bucket1\",\"baseKey\":\"dataSource1\",\"disableAcl\":false],\"maxListingLength\":...> but was:<{\"[disableAcl\":false,\"baseKey\":\"dataSource1\",\"bucket\":\"bucket1\"],\"maxListingLength\":...>\r\n        [ERROR]   Run 2: S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest.testSerialization:45 expected:<{\"[bucket\":\"bucket1\",\"baseKey\":\"dataSource1\",\"disableAcl\":false],\"maxListingLength\":...> but was:<{\"[disableAcl\":false,\"baseKey\":\"dataSource1\",\"bucket\":\"bucket1\"],\"maxListingLength\":...>\r\n        [ERROR]   Run 3: S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest.testSerialization:45 expected:<{\"[bucket\":\"bucket1\",\"baseKey\":\"dataSource1\",\"disableAcl\":false],\"maxListingLength\":...> but was:<{\"[disableAcl\":false,\"baseKey\":\"dataSource1\",\"bucket\":\"bucket1\"],\"maxListingLength\":...>\r\n        [ERROR]   Run 4: S3DataSegmentPusherConfigTest.testSerialization:45 expected:<{\"[bucket\":\"bucket1\",\"baseKey\":\"dataSource1\",\"disableAcl\":false],\"maxListingLength\":...> but was:<{\"[disableAcl\":false,\"baseKey\":\"dataSource1\",\"bucket\":\"bucket1\"],\"maxListingLength\":...>\r\n```\r\nSteps to verify the patch:\r\n\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/apache/druid.git`.\r\n2.

on to https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/14918\r\n\r\nSome cluster administrators may want to send particular tasks to the worker task runner instead of k8sTaskRunner, as the task startup time is usually faster on the worker task runner system.\r\n\r\nAn example use case is high throughput streaming ingestion where a long pod startup time can result in user visible lag. To get around this, an administrator could configure the cluster to have enough idle capacity to reasonably handle the high throughput stream and configure all other tasks to be handled by the k8s task runner while the streaming tasks are handled by the worker task runner.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\nAdd ability to send task types to k8s or worker task runner\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `RunnerStrategy` Strategy interface for selecting the appropriate runner\r\n * `KubernetesRunnerStrategy` Run task as K8s Peon\r\n * `WorkerRunnerStrategy` Run task in worker\r\n * `TaskTypeRunnerStrategy` Run tasks in a mixed mode\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nFixes an issue from #15058 with value matchers created by `UnnestDimensionCursor` for matches against non-existent values, which I forgot to update to match only null rows whenever `includeUnknown` is set to true. I checked around and didn't notice any other implementations with this issue, the problem was that it was treating the case as a non-existent column instead of an always false matcher that should only match null rows when `includeUnknown` is true, and so instead would effectively match nothing when used with a not filter. Added tests cover the case.\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid

Description\r\n\r\nFollow up to #15127, where I incorrectly advised during review to make arrays not translate `null` into `\"null\"` in `Rows.objectToStrings`, but forgot that stuff was counting on this behavior (however incorrect it may be).\r\n\r\n`Rows.toGroupKey` copies the output of `getDimension` into an `ImmutableSortedSet`, so this change can cause ingestion tasks with null array elements to fail with an error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException: at index 0\r\n\tat com.google.common.collect.ObjectArrays.checkElementNotNull(ObjectArrays.java:229)

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses Issue #15164 of the `DataSegment` dependency being repeatedly mocked across three different test suites. It introduces a `CreateMockDataSegment` class to eliminate this redundancy, enhancing the maintainability and extensibility of the code.\r\n\r\nAnd also Implemented a similar refactoring approach as described in issue #15164. Introduced a helper method `CreateMockTaskActionToolbox` to reuse the creation of `TaskActionToolbox` mocks. This reduces code redundancy and improves test readability.\r\n\r\n### Key Changes\r\n\r\n#### Introduced the `CreateMockDataSegment` Class\r\n\r\nA new class named [CreateMockDataSegment](https://github.com/gzhao9/druid/blob/Refactoring-org.apache.druid.segment.loading/server/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/segment/loading/CreateMockDataSegment.java) has been created to centralize the mocking of `DataSegment`, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.\r\n\r\n#### Optimized Test Suite Code\r\n\r\nThis refactoring approach has been applied to three test suites: [OmniDataSegmentMoverTest.java](https://github.com/gzhao9/druid/blob/Refactoring-org.apache.druid.segment.loading/server/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/segment/loading/OmniDataSegmentMoverTest.java), [OmniDataSegmentArchiverTest.java](https://github.com/gzhao9/druid/blob/Refactoring-org.apache.druid.segment.loading/server/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/segment/loading/OmniDataSegmentArchiverTest.java), and [OmniDataSegmentKillerTest.java](https://github.com/gzhao9/druid/blob/Refactoring-org.apache.druid.segment.loading/server/src/test/java/org/apache/druid/segment/loading/OmniDataSegmentKillerTest.java).\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `CreateMockTaskActionToolbox` method in `UpdateStatusActionTest.java`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] included a release note in the PR description.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n\r\nPlease note, the above is a sample filled out using the information from your provided issue. You may need to adjust it according to the actual content of your

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when reading values from an external data source (`EXTERN`), we don't cast the values to the signature passed by the user. This can cause an issue when reading values that are not casted by the underlying selectors. \r\n\r\nFor example, when reading a boolean array [true, false], we may run into a bug where the array is not casted to `ARRAY<LONG>` (internal representation for boolean) by the underlying selector, we pass it to methods assuming the `getObject()` returns a valid array type (Object[] with long values). Therefore it's important to cast the externally read values to the row signature passed by the user. This PR addresses the issue and preserves the type that is entered by the user in the query, regardless of what gets read. \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

#14535.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Druid provides a friendly and unified query gateway for users across multiple data centers and clusters through cluster federation queries.\r\n\r\n2. As the number of nodes and metadata increases, a single Druid cluster can become excessively large, leading to mutual interference among tasks and deteriorating scheduling performance. Implementing federated queries can help avoid such issues. It allows for breaking down large clusters into relatively independent ones as needed, making scheduling more agile and lightweight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `QueryContexts`\r\n * `BrokerServerView`\r\n * `CachingClusteredClient`\r\n * `TimelineServerView`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\nCurrently the inter Druid communication via rest endpoints is based on json formatted payload. Upon parsing error, there is only a generic exception stating expected json token type and current json token type. There is no detailed error log about the content of the payload causing the violation. \r\n\r\nIn the micro-service world, the trend is to deploy the Druid servers in k8 with the mesh network. Often the istio proxy or other proxies is used to intercept the network connection between Druid servers. The proxy may give error messages for various reasons. These error messages are not expected by the json parser. The generic error message from Druid can be very misleading as the user may think the message is based on the response from the other Druid server. \r\n\r\nFor example, this is an example of mysterious error message\r\n\r\n```\r\nQueryInterruptedException{msg=Next token wasn't a START_ARRAY, was[VALUE_STRING] from url[http://xxxxx:8088/druid/v2/], code=Unknown exception, class=org.apache.druid.java.util.common.IAE, host=xxxxx:8088}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile the context of the message is the following from the proxy when it can't tunnel the network connection.\r\n\r\n```\r\npstream connect error or disconnect/reset before header\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this very simple PR is just to enhance the logging and get the real underlying message printed out. This would save a lot of head scratching time if Druid is deployed with mesh network. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\n<!-- Give your best effort to summarize your changes in a couple of sentences aimed toward Druid users. \r\n\r\nIf your change doesn't have end user impact, you can skip this section.\r\n\r\nFor tips about how to write a good release note, see [Release notes](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#release-notes).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nImproved: enhanced the json parser unexpected token logging with the context of the expected VALUE_STRING token.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, MSQ adds the numbers from the array field and adds it to a `List` and converts this list to `Object[]` while returning it from the column value selector.\r\nThis patch optimizes this sequence by directly creating the `Object[]`. To do so, it requires the number of elements present in the array, which it gets by introducing `ReadableFieldPointer#length()` method.\r\n\r\nNo additional tests are required since the current reading and writing tests would handle the new codepaths\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

it's possible for there to be unnecessary task failures during streaming ingestion after tasks are launched and after tasks finish handoff (right before exit).\r\n\r\nThe errors occur when a peon is running (e.g. the jetty server is responding), but there is no chat handler registered for the task. SeekableStreamIndexTaskRunner is responsible for registering and deregistering the chat handler, but this is technically not synced up exactly with when the jetty server starts.\r\n\r\nIf the chat handler is not registered, the ChatHandlerResource throws a 400 (non-retryable) error. IMO this error should be a ServiceUnavailable error because the resource is per task,  so a missing handler indicates that the task is setting up or tearing down and can be retried.\r\n\r\nIf this ChatHandlerResource throws a 400 in response to a supervisor's getStatusAsync call, the supervisor will attempt to kill the task even though it may be in the process of starting up or shutting down successfully. The task will fail with \"Task [%s] failed to return status, killing task\", even though it may have been able to run successfully.\r\n\r\nUpdating the errror code from 400 -> 503 directly fixes the issue during startup, since the supervisor will retry the 503 error according to its retryPolicy and will eventually succeed when the task comes up.\r\n\r\nFor the case where a task is shutting down, the client will continue retrying the 503 exceptions (either from the ChatHandlerResource or from when Jetty itself has been torn down) (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/0a27a7a7ca1561630730c9288e5b36ead1268aed/server/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/rpc/ServiceClientImpl.java#L115). Eventually the task will be reported by the task runner as exited and this will be reflected in taskStorage. The client getStatusAsync call will stop retrying at this point and the future will fail (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/0a27a7a7ca1561630730c9288e5b36ead1268aed/indexing-service/src/main/java/org/apache/druid/indexing/seekablestream/SeekableStreamIndexTaskClientAsyncImpl.java#L661).\r\n\r\nTo handle this case, I added code in the supervisor logic to check taskStorage before killing a unresponsive task. If the task has been marked as complete in taskStorage, we can conclude that we were trying to contact a task that was in the process of cleaning up and we don't need to do anything else.\r\n\r\n#### Release note\r\nCleanup race condition that can occur at high streaming concurrency.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `SeekableStreamSupervisor`\r\n * `ChatHandlerResource`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] a release note entry in the PR description.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to improve the performance of HllSketchMergeAggregators.\r\n\r\n#### Improvements\r\n- Serialize to null instead of an empty sketch when converting to byte array. This will allow future ingestions to write null, which is faster to read and is slightly cheaper than storing an empty sketch of 8 bytes.\r\n- Directly check memory to see if the sketch is empty, based on certain flags. This will provide the benefits of the above without reingesting the data.\r\n- Add cache for hll union objects in HllSketchMergeAggregators\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.
