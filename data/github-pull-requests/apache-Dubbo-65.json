quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

change\r\n\r\nrun Tag samples\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-15T06:51:57Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T10:24:52Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T10:24:52Z","merged_at":"2019-01-15T10:24:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"5acb4bf8686a6c315d8f2f3754f3635909208ab4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3233/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3233/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3233/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b29aa39ea186c993e0690af70db29d6af1181d9c","head":{"label":"chickenlj:tagrouter-always-consider-static-tag","ref":"tagrouter-always-consider-static-tag","sha":"b29aa39ea186c993e0690af70db29d6af1181d9c","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

deprecated AnnotationBean, please refer #1485 for the new configuration method to replace.\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAnnotationBean was found to have some problems and has been replaced and marked deprecated since version 2.5.7. \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* ~~AnnotationBean.java~~\r\n* dubbo.xsd\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nCheck [dubbo-spring-boot-project]( https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo-spring-boot-project) for how the new way to use.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-15T05:13:20Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T07:00:02Z","closed_at":"2019-01-15T07:00:02Z","merged_at":"2019-01-15T07:00:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c38f20a6736e8f5e9679383d7c1f5da80f54795","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"mercyblitz","id":533114,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUzMzExNA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/533114?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz","html_url":"https://github.com/mercyblitz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mercyblitz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3232/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3232/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3232/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bd043f3116e6ff8d869465be341438f4b176578f","head":{"label":"chickenlj:remove-annotationbean-#1485","ref":"remove-annotationbean-#1485","sha":"bd043f3116e6ff8d869465be341438f4b176578f","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nOptimize heartbeat mechanism \r\nfix #3151 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n0. adjust hashedWheelTimer's instance, make it only one instance for heartbeat tasks and reconnect tasks, and make it's per tick duration to 1 second.\r\n1. initialize heartbeat task and reconnect task for each channel when it is connected.\r\n2. initialize hashedWheelTimer on HeartbeatHandler instinstead of that when HeaderExchangeServer or HeaderExchangeClient initialize.\r\n3. recalculate next tick duration for heartbeat task and reconnect task when it's task has done instead of using fixed duration.\r\n\r\nBased on the hashedWheelTimer's tick duration has bee set to 1 second, this optimization can guarantee the heartbeat and reconnect timeout precision is 1 second.\r\n\r\nand also I have provided a version of this optimization with detail log when heartbeat task or reconnect task has triggered in https://github.com/kexianjun/incubator-dubbo/tree/optimize_heart_with_log to make it convenient to test this optimization.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* User does not have to set `async=true` on Provider side to use provider async feature anymore, only `AsyncContext.startAsync()` is necessary.\r\n* stop tag from being transferred in the RPC chain\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* AsyncContext related classes\r\n* ContextFilter\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nrun `samples-async`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-10T09:39:28Z","updated_at":"2020-11-10T07:54:32Z","closed_at":"2019-01-11T15:28:14Z","merged_at":"2019-01-11T15:28:14Z","merge_commit_sha":"347f154b7ffe83c3d652c4bf7af6df66cd935864","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3184/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3184/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3184/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/42f537f5e304bc11a12d2c2f8e4095399ef6ac88","head":{"label":"chickenlj:async-enhancement","ref":"async-enhancement","sha":"42f537f5e304bc11a12d2c2f8e4095399ef6ac88","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-10T08:36:06Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T08:33:10Z","closed_at":"2019-01-11T08:33:10Z","merged_at":"2019-01-11T08:33:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"a8af5ce028e7c950b0670567dff9d0b0de5f9d25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3183/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3183/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3183/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ec9ed652c3b67bdb838eeb23ecb18897d5d18fb5","head":{"label":"foreveryang321:2.7.0-release","ref":"2.7.0-release","sha":"ec9ed652c3b67bdb838eeb23ecb18897d5d18fb5","user":{"login":"foreveryang321","id":5868190,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjgxOTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5868190?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321","html_url":"https://github.com/foreveryang321","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/foreveryang321/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:2.7.0-release","ref":"2.7.0-release","sha":"747b8049192527bdc6512f659efc044a100bb8f6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-10T06:18:17Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T12:37:07Z","closed_at":"2019-01-23T09:31:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"51dc179b2ce04cfdc25afda98ce62ccbe34960ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-09T15:19:58Z","updated_at":"2019-01-09T23:51:15Z","closed_at":"2019-01-09T23:51:15Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3178/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3178/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3178/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/b725826cb6559eb670de67385bc3074b5ede5c97","head":{"label":"apache:2.7.0-release","ref":"2.7.0-release","sha":"b725826cb6559eb670de67385bc3074b5ede5c97","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-07T16:29:22Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T03:28:45Z","closed_at":"2019-01-08T02:20:10Z","merged_at":"2019-01-08T02:20:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"e095bd9bab6c9527ee4da7031f49575651af1696","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3167/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3167/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3167/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ff072f22c5984b8b4418e6bff2296f2887936ec3","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:codeOptimization","ref":"codeOptimization","sha":"ff072f22c5984b8b4418e6bff2296f2887936ec3","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-07T08:46:35Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T08:49:21Z","closed_at":"2019-01-07T08:49:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3160/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3160/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3160/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8da7cb588bbf7b3a01dc39377e024febca2843de","head":{"label":"apache:3.x-dev","ref":"3.x-dev","sha":"8da7cb588bbf7b3a01dc39377e024febca2843de","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-07T08:07:20Z","updated_at":"2019-01-23T05:20:24Z","closed_at":"2019-01-23T05:03:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c3a021347d13f2069b3f7b698825337a66aacfaa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3159/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3159/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3159/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/d27fb1f5aa46706a52f63b336932dc24ab95b82f","head":{"label":"zonghaishang:master","ref":"master","sha":"d27fb1f5aa46706a52f63b336932dc24ab95b82f","user":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121260009,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjEyNjAwMDk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"zonghaishang/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zonghaishang","id":15549777,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NTQ5Nzc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15549777?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang","html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zonghaishang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zonghaishang/dubbo","description":"Open

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-07T03:54:27Z","updated_at":"2019-01-07T04:40:38Z","closed_at":"2019-01-07T04:30:05Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ce4aab81a3620cde7aae4d37b543db31109a5ef2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3154/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3154/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3154/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5897fdb3db8714c00ef8fb66fc1c7b657543d130","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:codeOptimization","ref":"codeOptimization","sha":"5897fdb3db8714c00ef8fb66fc1c7b657543d130","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-04T08:34:33Z","updated_at":"2019-01-04T08:35:13Z","closed_at":"2019-01-04T08:35:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e63c80e9885e0de71af55119e9ce3d033a5d8d37","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3142/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3142/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3142/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/3b54ad5ba524e6d8f957493b41494615df57e10b","head":{"label":"beiwei30:prefix","ref":"prefix","sha":"3b54ad5ba524e6d8f957493b41494615df57e10b","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"4b2b673ba346ae34a5c556f043321c4b987efedd","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues/2999\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nadd javadoc for registry and some code\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce ConfigManager, a centralized place where we can store global and shared Config instances. With ConfigManager, we can solve:\r\n1. Duplicate Config check which we have lost in the previous version (only work in Spring)\r\n2. Make it possible for a Builder pattern, see the comments I leave in ConfigManager.java\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Add ConfigManager\r\n2. Related changes in several Config classes.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun samples.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRelease resource after use in ConfigParserTest\r\n\r\nThis change was first introduced by #2905 ,\r\nbut somehow it was accidentally lost during merge `dev-metadata` branch.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nThe `yamlStream` should be closed after test method.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nrun unit tests\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIntroduce ConfigManager, a centralized place where we can store global and shared Config instances. With ConfigManager, we can solve:\r\n1. Duplicate Config check which we have lost in the previous version (only work in Spring)\r\n2. Make it possible for a Builder pattern, see the comments I leave in ConfigManager.java\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Add ConfigManager\r\n2. Related changes in several Config classes.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nRun samples.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-03T08:33:51Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T09:06:45Z","closed_at":"2019-01-03T09:06:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9173412ec76aee96041f9956cf03d3a324bde8cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3126/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3126/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3126/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e981dca7013c8f1f037c09dbc34925009bba5372","head":{"label":"chickenlj:ConfigCenter-optimization","ref":"ConfigCenter-optimization","sha":"e981dca7013c8f1f037c09dbc34925009bba5372","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2019-01-03T07:02:46Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T08:07:19Z","closed_at":"2019-01-03T07:32:37Z","merged_at":"2019-01-03T07:32:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"b7857f930354e2fdce74e613b4b0e5ebf3f42acc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3122/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3122/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3122/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/fc13d330b0a81f03fa6808e7212ae05e83cc585b","head":{"label":"biyuhao:fix-build","ref":"fix-build","sha":"fc13d330b0a81f03fa6808e7212ae05e83cc585b","user":{"login":"biyuhao","id":1197310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTczMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1197310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao","html_url":"https://github.com/biyuhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":146312405,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNDYzMTI0MDU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"biyuhao/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"biyuhao","id":1197310,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExOTczMTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1197310?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao","html_url":"https://github.com/biyuhao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/biyuhao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/biyuhao/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nunit test passed\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2019-01-03T06:42:59Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T08:21:56Z","closed_at":"2019-01-03T08:21:56Z","merged_at":"2019-01-03T08:21:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"3bf77abd86e7d51c74df307c4608b0294d89ca57","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3121/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3121/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3121/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/65375e5649e5a95b5d226d80c764d545ed63688f","head":{"label":"lixiaojiee:dubbo-monitor-annotated","ref":"dubbo-monitor-annotated","sha":"65375e5649e5a95b5d226d80c764d545ed63688f","user":{"login":"lixiaojiee","id":34837528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODM3NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34837528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee","html_url":"https://github.com/lixiaojiee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"95ebfe8b5a93942d3c3928ad5e9cd4709c76886a","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).","created_at":"2018-12-30T08:46:21Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T12:40:24Z","closed_at":"2019-01-02T12:40:23Z","merged_at":"2019-01-02T12:40:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"95ebfe8b5a93942d3c3928ad5e9cd4709c76886a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3103/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3103/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3103/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c0a7a4f2eab58104a5cf1df0b65e268650e8c0a7","head":{"label":"lixiaojiee:dubbo-config-annotated","ref":"dubbo-config-annotated","sha":"c0a7a4f2eab58104a5cf1df0b65e268650e8c0a7","user":{"login":"lixiaojiee","id":34837528,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0ODM3NTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34837528?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee","html_url":"https://github.com/lixiaojiee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lixiaojiee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"d41408e23f9f0b26f19a7c3e8f8bcfb5e9aaed1f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-29T11:23:56Z","updated_at":"2019-01-01T12:40:37Z","closed_at":"2019-01-01T12:40:37Z","merged_at":"2019-01-01T12:40:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"1bc1312c300ffa17713a665032d2154b12f91424","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3099/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3099/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3099/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/8b95d42890127dca76944719a1f77a55d58ff731","head":{"label":"beiwei30:interface-config-code-review","ref":"interface-config-code-review","sha":"8b95d42890127dca76944719a1f77a55d58ff731","user":{"login":"beiwei30","id":18651996,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjUxOTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18651996?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30","html_url":"https://github.com/beiwei30","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beiwei30/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"9396ace4fc00ca8f2e331b49ddabcb1e138e9e1c","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-29T03:46:23Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T12:00:46Z","closed_at":"2019-02-02T05:20:33Z","merged_at":"2019-02-02T05:20:32Z","merge_commit_sha":"c2c9de9d1206aebb3026a740d32cabea1677164c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo/milestone/23","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/milestones/23/labels","id":3971725,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzk3MTcyNQ==","number":23,"title":"2.7.1","description":"","creator":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":202,"state":"closed","created_at":"2019-01-15T04:57:02Z","updated_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z","due_on":"2019-03-15T07:00:00Z","closed_at":"2019-03-19T09:40:24Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3093/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3093/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3093/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/1db10779e80d894fdd4704e2e732d9a3b719cb88","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:dealInputEmpty","ref":"dealInputEmpty","sha":"1db10779e80d894fdd4704e2e732d9a3b719cb88","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-28T16:53:12Z","updated_at":"2018-12-29T01:48:07Z","closed_at":"2018-12-29T01:48:07Z","merged_at":"2018-12-29T01:48:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"5c54c6837876b7daf0c55d9f9cafde109baa1a5d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3092/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3092/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3092/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/90fe7ea6dfd946c89fbfc82c81dbafd8b0d0b3e2","head":{"label":"khanimteyaz:demo-consumer-start-issue","ref":"demo-consumer-start-issue","sha":"90fe7ea6dfd946c89fbfc82c81dbafd8b0d0b3e2","user":{"login":"khanimteyaz","id":30792765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzkyNzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30792765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz","html_url":"https://github.com/khanimteyaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":160236792,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjAyMzY3OTI=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"khanimteyaz/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"khanimteyaz","id":30792765,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwNzkyNzY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30792765?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz","html_url":"https://github.com/khanimteyaz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/khanimteyaz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/khanimteyaz/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-28T03:19:09Z","updated_at":"2018-12-28T04:30:15Z","closed_at":"2018-12-28T03:26:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a23043b264c7f6b56dec915c857e5fed5e2e951a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3086/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3086/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3086/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/79af072a0f3fa656a4abe761e546176724dd1ce0","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:useCondition","ref":"useCondition","sha":"79af072a0f3fa656a4abe761e546176724dd1ce0","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

[GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-27T15:21:17Z","updated_at":"2018-12-28T07:39:08Z","closed_at":"2018-12-27T15:31:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2c2a5fd2ab86ca1d248335cfe4afe3db217e1cd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3085/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3085/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3085/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/93726bc44c385495c2d5582bd6bd7a43a40c424f","head":{"label":"lovepoem:ignore_some_test_case_to_let_ci_success","ref":"ignore_some_test_case_to_let_ci_success","sha":"93726bc44c385495c2d5582bd6bd7a43a40c424f","user":{"login":"lovepoem","id":827112,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzExMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/827112?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem","html_url":"https://github.com/lovepoem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lovepoem/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5ea4fa531f9ec5ae446d4cb1ef2417b53712bd46","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-27T03:48:56Z","updated_at":"2019-01-11T03:27:56Z","closed_at":"2019-01-03T07:58:47Z","merged_at":"2019-01-03T07:58:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"6aad8dae077f47efb4c10da92b2a9605bb677e09","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3073/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3073/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3073/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c76b231be88b75cc6c2bb8e17341c1b0bf60be77","head":{"label":"CrazyHZM:removeDuplicateCode","ref":"removeDuplicateCode","sha":"c76b231be88b75cc6c2bb8e17341c1b0bf60be77","user":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":152715619,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTI3MTU2MTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"CrazyHZM/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrazyHZM","id":19588788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NTg4Nzg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19588788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM","html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrazyHZM/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrazyHZM/dubbo","description":"Apache

Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-26T12:16:12Z","updated_at":"2018-12-26T12:16:50Z","closed_at":"2018-12-26T12:16:49Z","merged_at":"2018-12-26T12:16:49Z","merge_commit_sha":"64d6ac8060ccea8aa04e21311ae13ac137ec4396","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3067/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3067/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3067/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/c2cd008914bba31b9f89931157d611b4e78223fd","head":{"label":"chickenlj:async-opmization","ref":"async-opmization","sha":"c2cd008914bba31b9f89931157d611b4e78223fd","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix spring doesn't allow setter override.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nchanges STH. like` setRegistry(registryLiteral)` to `setReistryIds(registryIds)`;\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/tree/master/dubbo-test).\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/incubator-dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2018-12-26T12:14:02Z","updated_at":"2018-12-26T12:17:41Z","closed_at":"2018-12-26T12:17:28Z","merged_at":"2018-12-26T12:17:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"86982cff8c342e5fc648e2ef8a22ef11d43bbd9c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3066/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/3066/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/3066/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/2f2bfc58773c0f31cb18148e00660182f0bdaca8","head":{"label":"chickenlj:configcenter-multi-registries","ref":"configcenter-multi-registries","sha":"2f2bfc58773c0f31cb18148e00660182f0bdaca8","user":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":133750259,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzM3NTAyNTk=","name":"incubator-dubbo","full_name":"chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj/incubator-dubbo","description":"Apache
