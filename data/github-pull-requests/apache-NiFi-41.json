Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdds a new method to `StatelessDataflow` called `isStateful`.  This allows the calling code to detect whether the dataflow contains any processors that maintain state.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9619 Removes the expired GPG key fingerprint from the Security Vulnerability Disclosure documentation. The difficulty of securely sharing a GPG private key among members of the Project Management Committee outweighs the benefit of supporting encrypted disclosure messages, so the most straightforward change is to remove the expired GPG key fingerprint and simplify the reporting instructions.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Since one of the motivations for this upgrade is to reduce the number of illegal reflective access errors, I noticed the version of Mockito in MiNiFi Java is ancient so I upgraded that too.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9617 Removes several large unused screenshots from the documentation directory. Previous documentation on the encrypted repository implementations referenced these screenshots, but recent updates to the implementation and documentation removed references to these files.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

is a follow up on NIFI-8519: the NAR Provider has been refactored for being more flexible (both in usage and with furher extensions). With this some feature has been added:\r\n- Allowing providers to replace already existing files if certain conditions apply, using \"conflict resolution strategies\"\r\n- Restraining NiFi from startup until the first fetch has been succeeded (optional)\r\n- Adding a property to refine poll interval\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\n_Enables X functionality; fixes bug NIFI-YYYY._\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\n- ids of the entities are prefixed by their types to avoid id conflict in 3rd party table library\r\n   For some authorizers the UUID calculation for users and groups based only on the name of the entity and a global seed.\r\n   This results the same UUID for a group and a user with the same name. The same ids are no longer causing any issue on the UI.\r\n- group icon alignment is fixed for edit user dialog\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9611 Removes unnecessary references to `nifi-processor-utils` from multiple modules and adds references to `nifi-utils` where necessary.  Several modules had undeclared dependencies on `commons-lang3` through `nifi-processor-utils`. Removing and replacing references to `nifi-processor-utils` removes around 30 MB from the final NiFi binary.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name

Description of PR\r\n\r\nRecent CI runs have warned of limited available disk space after build executes.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWindows Zulu JDK 8 FR\r\nYou are running out of disk space. The runner will stop working when the machine runs out of disk space. Free space left: 81 MB\r\n```\r\n\r\nAddress this by excluding additional `*-assembly` modules from the CI build.  \r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9608 Disables the `system-tests` workflow for pull requests. The `system-tests` workflow retains the scheduled execution configuration to run every 24 hours to provide opportunity for additional troubleshooting. Disabling the `system-tests` workflow for pull requests avoids automated build failures due to unresolved issues with system tests running on GitHub.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9606 Removes `nifi-security-utils` as a dependency in `nifi-framework-api`.  The `nifi-framework-api` module does not include any direct references to `nifi-security-utils`, and other modules that require `nifi-security-utils` already include direct dependencies.  PR #4436 introduced `nifi-security-utils` as a dependency in `nifi-framework-api`, but the addition is no longer necessary.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9600 Removes the `FetchElasticsearch` and `PutElasticsearch` processors based on the Elasticsearch 2 library and the deprecated Transport Client.  The last Elasticsearch 2 version reached [end of life](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol) in 2018.  Removing these processors eliminates the legacy Elasticsearch 2 dependency and related libraries in `nifi-elasticsearch-processors`. Additional changes include removing integration test classes and ignored test methods for the other deprecated processors that remain in the `nifi-elasticsearch-processors` module.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

To directly use those images you have to create specific Security Context Constraints (SCC) and give further capabilities to Service Accounts just to be able to have initContainers changing file ownership inside the images.\r\nThe new container image definitions, based on [ubi8/OpenJDK11](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/ubi8/openjdk-11/5dd6a4b45a13461646f677f4), are fully compatible with OpenShift and have the right files and directories ownership from the start, allowing to use them without relaxing security constraints. That makes them usable by standard users who would not normally have the rights to create those SCCs.\r\nImages definitions are provided for nifi, nifi-registry and nifi-toolkit, in folders named `openshift` alongside the `dockerhub` folders in their respective location.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [X] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by:

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9591 Removes the `nifi-kite-bundle` and associated components. The [Kite](http://kitesdk.org/docs/current/) project last published a release in 2015 and the associated GitHub project does not show any activity for several years. For these reasons, the `nifi-kite-bundle` and associated modules should be removed.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9481 Excludes Site to Site Data Transfer REST resources from the standard Denial-of-Service Filter configured for the Jetty Server.\r\n\r\nS2S communication incorporates separate own timeout handling for transactions, and the DoSFilter can result in unexpected transmission failures when transferring large files using S2S with HTTP. The `DataTransferExcludedDoSFilter` is a custom extension of the standard Jetty `DoSFilter` that excludes REST resource methods having a Request URI that starts with `/nifi-api/data-transfer`.\r\n\r\nImplementation changes include refactoring Jetty Server request filter configuration to a separate `RequestFilterProvider` interface with implementations for standard and REST API applications. Abstracting request filter configuration following this approach reduces the complexity of the `JettyServer` class and supports related unit testing improvements.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This PR is based off of the work done on that branch, so please do not merge until #5593 has been merged. The initial proposal containing UI requirements can be found [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NIFI/Framework-Level+Retries+to+Improve+Failure+Handling) \r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n* I don't see an example of radio buttons used in NiFi's UI, but I used them for the Backoff Policy control since it made most sense (the value is either penalize flow file or yield entire processor from what I understand). I can switch these out for checkboxes that behave like radio buttons to be more aligned with NiFi's design system if others believe that's the better option.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-18T14:53:54Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T19:57:18Z","closed_at":"2022-03-01T19:57:18Z","merged_at":"2022-03-01T19:57:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"4719f78ef4be3508008bb5c49dbb16942cb51a7e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5666/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5666/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5666/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/8a14a449973bdc85c2283872854fac53c0b23d51","head":{"label":"sardell:retry-ui","ref":"retry-ui","sha":"8a14a449973bdc85c2283872854fac53c0b23d51","user":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":252442063,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNTI0NDIwNjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"sardell/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sardell","id":7304869,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMDQ4Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7304869?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell","html_url":"https://github.com/sardell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sardell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sardell/nifi","description":"Mirror

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9571 Corrects `PutTCP` and `PutUDP` Process Session handling to call `commitAsync()` after transferring FlowFiles to a destination relationship. Changes for NIFI-9546 in #5639 removed some invocations of `commitAsync()` during refactoring. With the addition of the `SupportsBatching` annotation and the fact that these processors extend `AbstractSessionFactoryProcessor`, calling `ProcessSession.commitAsync()` directly is necessary.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include adjustments to `AbstractPutEventProcessor` using a generic type for the message class. This avoids compiler warnings and provides type-safety for calls to the `EventSender`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-6266 Corrects proxy connection handling for FTP components and adds support for SOCKS proxy servers with authentication.\r\n\r\nThe current `FTPTransfer` class attempted FTP server host resolution using `InetAddress.getByName()` in order to pass an instance of `InetAddress` to Commons Net `FTPClient.connect()`.  Although `FTPClient.connect()` accepts a `String` for the host parameter, the `connect()` implementation performs the same `InetAddress.getByName()` resolution.  In environments where the NiFi system cannot resolve the destination FTP server address, the `InetAddress.getByName()` throws an exception.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this problem, a new `ProxyFTPClient` extends the standard `FTPClient` and overrides the `connect(String host, int port)` method to create an `InetSocketAddress` that allows the host to be unresolved.  This approach allows a proxy socket to pass the unresolved host to the proxy server, relying on the proxy server to perform name resolution.  Proxy server connections require FTP passive mode, which is the default setting for the `Connection Mode` property. In addition to overriding the `FTPClient.connect()` method, disabling the Passive NAT Workaround Hostname Resolver is also necessary.  Calling `FTPClient.setPassiveNatWorkaroundStrategy()` with a `null` value disables potential hostname resolution that could also cause transfers to fail when connecting through a proxy server.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include refactoring `FTPClient` creation using a new `FTPClientProvider` that follows the same approach as the `SSHClientProvider`.  The `StandardFTPClientProvider` handles configuring processor properties and also disconnects the `FTPClient` on initial failures, such as authentication problems.  These changes also provided the opportunity to remove several unused utility classes.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9563 Removes the deprecation comments from the `Pool Receive Buffers` property in `ListenTCP`. Refactoring `ListenTCP` using Netty removed usage of this property, but it can be repurposed to control the Netty `ByteBufAllocator`.\r\n\r\nThe default Netty configuration uses the `PooledByteBufAllocator`, which aligns with the default value for the `Pool Receive Buffers` property.  Adding a new `BufferAllocator` enum as a property on `NettyEventServerFactory` provides the method for changing the Netty Channel Option to use the `UnpooledByteBufAllocator` when `Pool Receive Buffers` is disabled in `ListenTCP`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9564 Removes unnecessary `logback-classic` test dependencies from `nifi-bootstrap` and `nifi-bootstrap-utils`. The presence of this library conflicts with the default `slf4j-simple` test dependency, which appears to corrupt the standard error stream, causing failures with the maven-surefire-plugin.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9438 Refactors the `nifi-sensitive-property-provider` module to the following separate modules based on various types of providers:\r\n\r\n- nifi-property-protection-api\r\n- nifi-property-protection-factory\r\n- nifi-property-protection-aws\r\n- nifi-property-protection-azure\r\n- nifi-property-protection-cipher\r\n- nifi-property-protection-gcp\r\n- nifi-property-protection-hashicorp\r\n- nifi-property-protection-shared\r\n\r\nThis approach allows for more specific dependency management within individual providers while still supporting unified access to provider implementations through the `nifi-property-protection-factory` module.\r\n\r\nRefactoring into separate modules required some clarification and simplification of the `SensitivePropertyProvider` interface as well as the `StandardSensitivePropertyProviderFactory`. Instead of having a direct association between the command line argument values supported in the `PropertyProtectionScheme` enumeration, the `nifi-property-protection-api` module introduces a `ProtectionSchemeResolver` interface.  The `StandardProtectionSchemeResolver` encapsulates resolution from command line arguments to `ProtectionScheme` instances. This approach decouples the `SensitivePropertyProvider` implementation from the `PropertyProtectionScheme` enumeration and instead relies on registering the protection scheme path exposed through the `SensitivePropertyProvider.getIdentifierKey()` method.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include renaming `AESSensitivePropertyProvider` to `AesGcmSensitivePropertyProvider` as well as removing and streamlining a number of unit tests that performed duplicative testing of AES-GCM cipher operations.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nPlease provide a short description of the PR here:\r\n\r\n#### Description of PR\r\n\r\nAs OperationType and Operand is well defined and central in the C2 specification their values and valid mappings should be reflected in the API so we could avoid invalid operation configurations on the protocol level. Similarly to OperationType OperandType was introduced and known mappings were defined.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9556 Upgrades multiple revisions of Apache HttpClient 4.5 to 4.5.13 and also upgrades Apache HttpCore to 4.4.15. These upgrades address multiple vulnerabilities and bugs associated with earlier versions of Apache HttpClient.\r\n\r\nChanges include the addition of dependency management declarations in the root Maven configuration to control version and exclusions of Apache HttpClient 4.5 and HttpCore 4.4 for both direct and transitive dependencies. This approach removes the need for individual version declarations and exclusions in multiple modules.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7089 Upgrades Apache SSHD from 1.7.0 to 2.8.0 for SFTP tests in `nifi-standard-processors`, and replaces the `fake-sftp-server-rule` library with direct references to Apache SSHD Server. These changes address test performance issues on some platforms, such as Ubuntu 20, where SFTP unit tests would hang.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9541 Proposes the removal of Elasticsearch 5 Processors contained in the `nifi-elasticsearch-5-bundle`.\r\n\r\n[Elasticsearch 5.0](https://www.elastic.co/support/eol) reached end of life on 2018-04-26. The last minor version, Elasticsearch 5.6, reached end of life on 2019-03-11.\r\n\r\nThe NiFi Elasticsearch 5 processors use the Elasticsearch binary transport protocol, which Elastic deprecated in version 6. NiFi 1.12.0 removed the `nifi-elasticsearch-5-nar` from the standard binary distribution, requiring a separate download from the Maven Central Repository. Continuing to support the Elasticsearch 5 processors will become more difficult without further Elasticsearch 5 client updates, and users who require this version can continue to download and run the most recent `nifi-elasticsearch-5-nar` from Maven Central. For these reasons, the Elasticsearch 5 processors should be removed from future releases.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-06T05:39:22Z","updated_at":"2022-01-07T19:31:27Z","closed_at":"2022-01-07T19:31:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f9c831da17c1a32f557f782e61a6bcb677046cc5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5636/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5636/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5636/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/08779d02ab4e0e0f6583d7d6f085621f25953ed4","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9541","ref":"NIFI-9541","sha":"08779d02ab4e0e0f6583d7d6f085621f25953ed4","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9539 Upgrades Netty from 4.1.69 to 4.1.72.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade includes adding the Netty 4 Bill of Materials dependency to the root Maven configuration to enforce the same version of Netty 4 across framework and extension components. This approach removes the need for selective overrides in separate modules. Additional changes include removing commented dependencies from MiNiFi and the unnecessary version override of the ZooKeeper dependency.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-05T21:46:10Z","updated_at":"2022-01-05T23:19:23Z","closed_at":"2022-01-05T23:19:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6258baa1d460af156a81361add0991d3a3abdcb4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5635/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5635/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5635/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/839854ec441d9dd467d5cc239b4627c8e17d0c66","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9539","ref":"NIFI-9539","sha":"839854ec441d9dd467d5cc239b4627c8e17d0c66","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9535 Upgrades Spring Framework libraries from 5.3.11 to 5.3.14 and includes the following additional upgrades:\r\n\r\n- Upgraded Spring Security from 5.5.2 to 5.6.1\r\n- Upgraded Spring Boot from 2.5.5 to 2.5.8 in Registry\r\n- Upgraded Spring Integration from 5.5.2 to 5.5.7\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include centralized dependency version management for Spring Framework and Spring Security dependencies using Bill of Materials dependencies in the root project Maven configuration. Previous updates introduced the same version across NiFi components. Importing the Bill of Materials dependencies in the root Maven configuration removed the need for separate version declarations in multiple modules.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9534 Upgrades the Log4j 2 bill of materials dependency from 2.17.0 to 2.17.1.\r\n\r\nThis upgrade mitigates potential security scan false positives related to Log4j 2 `log4j-api` and `log4j-to-slf4j` dependencies.  These dependencies are not subject to the same security concerns associated with `log4j-core`, which NiFi excludes using the Maven Enforcer Plugin.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9530 Removes `google-cloud-pubsublite` from `nifi-gcp-processors` for the NiFi 1.15 support branch in order to avoid runtime class conflicts.\r\n\r\nThis version of `google-cloud-pubsublite` requires different versions of the Google GRPC libraries that conflict with the versions of GRPC from `google-cloud-pubsub`. This is working as expected in the main branch as a result of other changes in NIFI-9304, so this adjustment is limited to the 1.15 support branch.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-04T16:36:59Z","updated_at":"2022-01-04T21:06:09Z","closed_at":"2022-01-04T21:06:09Z","merged_at":"2022-01-04T21:06:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9b8387478daf0dc6e6263b80d6f4e3f83aa52f7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/3f0317130a4ba3681ad47250fe96865af8a04ddb","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9530","ref":"NIFI-9530","sha":"3f0317130a4ba3681ad47250fe96865af8a04ddb","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Over time, these statements become misaligned with what is actually happening in the Nifi lib directory and cause RPM deployments to fail.  This PR replaces the package statements with a single statement to include in the RPM the contents of the lib directory that have already been produced by the build.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2022-01-04T13:21:22Z","updated_at":"2022-01-12T22:52:25Z","closed_at":"2022-01-12T22:52:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d228e4a7465f135479166cf8b6cfa360ca95c454","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5626/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5626/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5626/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/4941cfb5025973615fa31c89a484cbf0ce327091","head":{"label":"gforeman02:NIFI-9525","ref":"NIFI-9525","sha":"4941cfb5025973615fa31c89a484cbf0ce327091","user":{"login":"gforeman02","id":22566958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTY2OTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22566958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02","html_url":"https://github.com/gforeman02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":444199676,"node_id":"R_kgDOGnny_A","name":"nifi","full_name":"gforeman02/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gforeman02","id":22566958,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNTY2OTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22566958?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02","html_url":"https://github.com/gforeman02","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gforeman02/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gforeman02/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-7835 Adds support for accessing SFTP servers through SOCKS 5 proxy servers that require authentication. Support for authenticated proxy server access also applies to HTTP proxy servers, resolving NIFI-7749.\r\n\r\nNiFi SFTP components use SSHJ since version 1.10.0. SSHJ does not provide direct support for authenticated proxy server access, and the current NiFi implementation supports SOCKS and HTTP proxy access without authentication using a custom `ProxySocketFactory`. The `java.net.Authenticator` class does not support providing proxy username and password credentials for single instances of `java.net.Proxy`, instead requiring the use an `Authenticator` instance for the entire JVM using the `Authenticator.setDefault()` method. This approach is not suitable for NiFi components that may require different sets of credentials for different component instances.\r\n\r\nThis pull request integrates the [BrokeredSocketFactory](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.exceptionfactory.socketbroker/socketbroker/latest/com/exceptionfactory/socketbroker/BrokeredSocketFactory.html) from the [socketbroker](https://github.com/exceptionfactory/socketbroker) library to support authenticated access to SOCKS and HTTP proxy servers from NiFi SFTP components.\r\n\r\nRuntime configurations can be tested using proxy servers that implement standard SOCKS 5 and HTTP CONNECT protocols. The following open source proxy servers can be configured with authentication for testing:\r\n\r\n- [Dante](https://hub.docker.com/r/wernight/dante) SOCKS 5 Proxy\r\n- [Tinyproxy](https://hub.docker.com/r/monokal/tinyproxy) HTTP Proxy\r\n- [Squid](https://hub.docker.com/r/ubuntu/squid) HTTP Proxy\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9267 Replaces usage of the custom Jetty-based `TestServer` in `nifi-standard-web-test-utils` with the OkHttp `MockWebServer`.  The OkHttp `MockWebServer` provides a streamlined approach to sending prepared responses and evaluating requests.  Additional changes include removing several integration tests which referenced the `SslContextUtils` class in `nifi-standard-web-test-utils`.  These adjustments allowed for removing all references to `nifi-standard-web-test-utils`.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check GitHub Actions CI for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-22T04:26:39Z","updated_at":"2022-01-09T10:25:57Z","closed_at":"2022-01-09T10:25:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"26de1bedfc125b52ba1689ebdc3d376b0d3ef6c9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5620/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/5620/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/5620/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/c42e2ddf536ee8ba22a11342dd53f21e1061a1d3","head":{"label":"exceptionfactory:NIFI-9267","ref":"NIFI-9267","sha":"c42e2ddf536ee8ba22a11342dd53f21e1061a1d3","user":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":297800463,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTc4MDA0NjM=","name":"nifi","full_name":"exceptionfactory/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"exceptionfactory","id":20425862,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNDI1ODYy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20425862?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory","html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/exceptionfactory/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/exceptionfactory/nifi","description":"Apache

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9509 Adds a `PatchedSFTPEngine` that extends the standard SSHJ `SFTPEngine` to workaround rename flag handling in SSHJ 0.32.0.\r\n\r\nAs described in [SSHJ issue 751,](https://github.com/hierynomus/sshj/issues/751) initial support for SFTP rename flags introduced communication problems for SFTP servers that do not support SFTP protocol version 5 or higher. This patched approach can be removed once a new version of SSHJ introduces similar conditional handling of SFTP rename flags.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9507 Corrects SSH Client handling in all SFTP processors when initial connection or authentication fails.\r\n\r\nThe SSH Client instantiates and starts a Keep Alive Thread when `Send Keep Alive on Timeout` is enabled. When the initial connection or authentication fails, the NiFi `SFTPTransfer` class did not close the instance of SSH Client, resulting in the associated `keep-alive` thread continuing to run.\r\n\r\nThe refactored SSH Client handling delegates configuration and connection to a new `SSHClientProvider` interface and associated implementation.  The `StandardSSHClientProvider` translates processor properties to SSH Client settings then initiates connection and authentication.  The provider implementation closes the SSH Client instance and interrupts the Keep Alive Thread when encountering any exceptions. This change avoids leaving Keep Alive Threads running.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes include naming the Keep Alive Thread using the host and port properties associated with connection.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [X] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9483 Excludes Log4j 2 `log4j-core` and related Log4j 2 libraries from the following extension modules that do not have runtime dependencies on Log4j 2:\r\n\r\n- nifi-atlas-reporting-task\r\n- nifi-druid-controller-service-api\r\n- nifi-hive3-processors\r\n- nifi-ranger-plugin\r\n- nifi-registry-ranger-plugin\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-elasticsearch-5-processors` module requires Log4j 2 `log4j-api` to support Elasticsearch at runtime. Instead of `log4j-core`, the `log4j-to-slf4j` library provides runtime routing of Log4j 2 Loggers to SLF4J, removing the need for `log4j-core`.\r\n\r\nThese changes remove the need for any references to the Log4j 2 `log4j-core` library.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [ ] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nAdd new NiFi NARs `nifi-kafka-3-0-processors` and `nifi-kafka-3-0-nar`.  These are copies of the kafka-2-6 NARs as of git commit `b578f183cb593eae8a845d82f7fc28615e043ae9`, with minor changes to account for Kafka 3.0 method API updates.\r\n\r\nTo manage the size of the nifi-assembly binary distributable, we may consider removing certain versions of nifi-kafka.  At present, the following kafka nars are included:\r\n- nifi-kafka-1-0-nar\r\n- nifi-kafka-2-0-nar\r\n- nifi-kafka-2-6-nar\r\n- nifi-kafka-3-0-nar (NEW)\r\n\r\nAll nifi-kafka versions will continue to be built; this would just affect the content of the nifi-assembly binary.\r\n\r\nThe `nifi-kafka-3-0-processors` references to Scala remain at version 2.13, which is unchanged from `nifi-kafka-2-6-processors`.\r\n\r\nAdditional information about Kafka 3.0 may be found here:\r\n- https://kafka.apache.org/downloads\r\n\r\nTested a single node NiFi instance and a three node NiFi cluster against a local Kafka 3.0.0 instance (single node) using topics with three partitions.  GenerateFlowFile was at the head of the data flow, with two PublishKafka_3_0 / ConsumeKafka_3_0 pairs, and terminating with a PutFile.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [x] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [x] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is

Description of PR\r\n\r\nNIFI-9491 Excludes the Apache `commons-logging` from all modules and adds it to the list of banned dependencies for the Maven Enforcer Plugin.\r\n\r\nThe `jcl-over-slf4j` provides runtime routing of Apache Commons Logging to SLF4J and Logback, which overrides transitive references to `commons-logging` in numerous extension components. Excluding the `commons-logging` dependency and adding an already provided dependency reference to `jcl-over-slf4j` works with existing references to Apache Commons Logging while removing the unnecessary library from compiled artifacts.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [X] Does your PR title start with **NIFI-XXXX** where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [X] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `main`)?\r\n\r\n- [X] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit? _Additional commits in response to PR reviewer feedback should be made on this branch and pushed to allow change tracking. Do not `squash` or use `--force` when pushing to allow for clean monitoring of changes._\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [X] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via `mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install` at the root `nifi` folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 8?\r\n- [X] Have you verified that the full build is successful on JDK 11?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the `LICENSE` file, including the main `LICENSE` file under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [X] If applicable, have you updated the `NOTICE` file, including the main `NOTICE` file found under `nifi-assembly`?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added `.displayName` in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is
