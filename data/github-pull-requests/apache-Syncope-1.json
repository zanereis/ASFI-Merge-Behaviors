Generally it is better to use\nthe <a href=\"https://jsoup.org/cookbook/web/request-session\">Jsoup.newSession</a> method to maintain a cookie jar, as that\napplies appropriate path selection on cookies when making requests. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1831\">1831</a></li>\n<li>When parsing named HTML entities, base entities should resolve if they are a prefix of the input token (and not in an\nattribute). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2207\">2207</a></li>\n<li>Fixed incorrect tracking of source ranges for attributes merged from late-occurring elements that were implicitly\ncreated (<code>html</code> or <code>body</code>). <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2204\">2204</a></li>\n<li>Follow the current HTML specification in the tokenizer to allow <code>&lt;</code> as part of a tag name, instead of emitting it as a\ncharacter node. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2230\">2230</a></li>\n<li>Similarly, allow a <code>&lt;</code> as the start of an attribute name, vs creating a new element. The previous behavior was\nintended to parse closer to what we anticipated the author's intent to be, but that does not align to the spec or to\nhow browsers behave. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1483\">1483</a></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/71063c3d4bb4bcc83c4655bdf6347ce2f5670a7c\"><code>71063c3</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release jsoup-1.18.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/1a91aac56176edcb2327569feb5aff5282f8cacb\"><code>1a91aac</code></a> Use the incoming node's parent if outgoing has already been removed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/df404cf5ac12fb295e8abd9e05de1dcbcea30657\"><code>df404cf</code></a> test case for Issue <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/2212\">#2212</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/28db617354cc2ed60a8b978865e71e5d7c6b6224\"><code>28db617</code></a> Test for <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1938\">#1938</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/d27370ac7ecd7eee843b3153c81f44e46b4ef63c\"><code>d27370a</code></a> Follow spec so <code>&lt;</code> can start an attribute name</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/0ef4b70b2acf47c1094aedbb9954324a2e84c05e\"><code>0ef4b70</code></a> Allow <code>&lt;</code> in tag name state</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/51909b1af727eea21bc011633519e31aaff82048\"><code>51909b1</code></a> Tweak HTML javadoc <code>&gt;</code></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/91b5a56c63a9f8dca761b4cab959977fcd3308fd\"><code>91b5a56</code></a> Copy attribute source range when merging attributes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/5ee376bc5bbe6a4f66eb24e2180552b547b8a4bf\"><code>5ee376b</code></a> Entity decoding supports prefix matches</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/commit/708fc1fc5e41b8bb02d0ce15a9da8086f6bdb9dd\"><code>708fc1f</code></a> Make And and Or constructors public</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/compare/jsoup-1.18.1...jsoup-1.18.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=org.jsoup:jsoup&package-manager=maven&previous-version=1.18.1&new-version=1.18.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
