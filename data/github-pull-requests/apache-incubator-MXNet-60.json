However, algorithms may have specialized kernels for the beta==0 case, different and faster than the generalized beta kernels.  Should the generalized kernels have issues with the problem size different than the beta==0 kernels, then the algos returned by cudnnFind() might fail when invoked with beta==1 (as it is when the convolution op grad_req='add' argument is present).\r\n\r\nThe demonstrated problem area involves a large 'c' value of 64K, where for the backprop-to-filter kernel only algo 1 handles the beta==1 case.  CudnnFind() was shown to occasionally return algos 0 or 3 as fastest, and both of these return error 8 \"execution failed\" when run.\r\n\r\nThe fix is based on the observation that cudnnGet() returns algo 1 for the backprop-to-filter kernel for the troublesome problem sizes.  Thus,  the fix is to avoid cudnnFind() when grad_req='add' and force use of cudnnGet() instead.  The fix maintains the effectiveness of the caching of algo lookups and convolution op instances, so neither cudnnFind() nor cudnnGet() is called repeatedly.  Deconvolution was similarly updated with this fix.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X ] The PR title starts with

changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv

Description ##\r\nIn this PR, it fixed issue of test_gru_bidirectional #11219 and add robust code. @pengzhao-intel, @TaoLv \r\n\r\n## Feature changes ##\r\n### New features ###\r\n- Fixed issue of test_gru_bidirectional #11219. The reason is when creating temporary tensor for reshape, the code utilize the unallocated memory because of the incorrect start and end point. Because the data in unallocated memory didn't be used in linalg_gemm, sometimes the code can pass and sometimes it will crash. We added 1000 times checking for test_gru_bidirectional in tests/python/unittests/test_operator.py. And will keep 1 time checking after testing is passed\r\n- Add robust code like param initialization.

object solved the issue.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have a suggestion as to how to test this without introducing a dependency on ray?\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and

Description ##\r\nMKLDNNSum helper function can handle variable number of inputs\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Refactor MKLDNNSum to accept vector in mem\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nPreviously our `take` operator only supports axis=0 and mode = 'clip' case, this PR adds support for axis in range [-r, r-1] and an additional mode 'wrap'.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Support for take on any dimension\r\n- [x] New mode 'wrap' for indices\r\n- [x] Unit tests for enhanced take operator\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThe legacy implementation for axis=0 and mode='clip' is still preserved to ensure there's no performance or accuracy regression after the

Description ##\r\nThis PR introduces runtime integration of TensorRT into MxNet, in order to accelerate inference. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Test coverage:\r\n  - the end-to-end application of the graph partitioner, NNVM-to-ONNX converer, and TensorRT inference is covered by a test (LeNet-5 on MNIST). Some intermediate methods aren't tested, but end-to-end is. \r\n- [x] CI build updates\r\n  - There is a new Docker build for TensorRT, along with a unit test. \r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n  - Code is fairly documented\r\n  - There is additional documentation regarding the design [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Runtime+Integration+with+TensorRT).\r\n  - A [README](https://github.com/mkolod/incubator-mxnet/blob/tensorrt_integration/docs/api/python/contrib/tensorrt.md) discusses usage\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] NNVM graph partitioner for TensorRT graph compatibility\r\n- [x] NNVM-to-ONNX converter (for common layers such as convolution, batchnorm, pooling, fully-connected, etc.)\r\n- [x] Git submodule to support the [ONNX-to-TensorRT](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorrt) graph converter  \r\n- [x] Makefile updates to support linking against ONNX, Protobuf (for ONNX) and TensorRT\r\n- [x] Code guards to only enable the TensorRT-inclusive build when USE_TENSORRT flag is added to config.mk\r\n- [x] End-to-end (training/inference) unit test for LeNet-5 on MNIST\r\n- [x] Tests of Gluon CV zoo model converted to symbol API graphs (ResNet v1/v2, ResNeXt, SSD)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- The TensorRT 3.0 package only works with CUDA up to 9.0. TensorRT 4.0 is in RC and will soon be GA, and it will support CUDA 9.1 onwards.

Description ##\r\nAdding some diagnostic ccache output to builds using ccache.  This output will allow us to get a sense of both the global level of caching for the system, and will provide diagnostic information for the specific builds via the log files.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nThe instruction for installing nose package should add the 'sudo' in the command. Otherwise, the Mac OS bash would not recognize the nosetests command. This has been discussed in Stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18796988/installing-nose-using-pip-but-bash-doesnt-recognize-command-on-mac)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-15T22:12:11Z","updated_at":"2018-06-16T03:17:34Z","closed_at":"2018-06-16T01:22:17Z","merged_at":"2018-06-16T01:22:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"5431e12f11fc5446f6ec2a25098b4e3b67ee7eb3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11313/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11313/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11313/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/06c697d9b405e25b68c7e96100576b61095fb0fb","head":{"label":"piiswrong:static","ref":"static","sha":"06c697d9b405e25b68c7e96100576b61095fb0fb","user":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44707337,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcwNzMzNw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"piiswrong/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"piiswrong","id":568948,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU2ODk0OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/568948?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong","html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/piiswrong/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/piiswrong/mxnet","description":"Efficient

Description ##\r\n\r\nAdded tutorial that demonstrates a method of finding a good initial starting learning rate.\r\n\r\nMethod from [\"Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks\" by Leslie N. Smith (2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01186). And seen in many blog posts (e.g. https://towardsdatascience.com/estimating-optimal-learning-rate-for-a-deep-neural-network-ce32f2556ce0).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR restructures the dockcross Dockerfiles to remove their multi-head components.  These multi-head components made it difficult to properly provide a remote cache for the Dockerfiles, and was slowing down builds.   A simple work-around for this was to generalize the ubuntu_ccache.sh file such that it works with ubuntu, debian, and in cross-compilation containers.  We can now use this script the same way in a variety of containers, which eliminates the need for a special multi-head docker stage.\r\n\r\nShould address #11257.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

all,\r\n\r\nFor MKLDNN, creating operator primitive and corresponding memory will spend a lot of time, for many scenarios,  the created primitive can be reused if it meets requirement for next computing. In this PR, we implemented the caching mechanism for most backward operators, just like the optimization have done for forward operator.  Correctness test and accuracy test are all PASS. Performance test shown that most models can get speed up in training. Please review this, Thanks. \r\n\r\n@zheng-da, @marcoabreu, @azai91, @TaoLv, @pengzhao-intel\r\n\r\nThis PR covers below commits.\r\nEnable primitive allocation cache for _backward_LRN\r\nEnable

Description ##\r\n\r\nFirst tutorial is on learning rate schedules in `mxnet.lr_scheduler`, how to use them with Optimizer and Trainer in Gluon and how to implement a custom learning rate schedule. Contains visualizations of the schedules.\r\n\r\nSecond tutorial shows how to use common learning rate schedules such as Cyclical schedules, SDG with Restarts, Warm-up and Cool-down. Many paper references are provided. Contains visualizations of the schedules.\r\n\r\nAdded to tutorial testing and index page.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR is a bug fixes on the Spark Example for Scala. We need to ensure there are enough amount of tests. Here is the plan for the release:\r\n\r\n- Fix the [Ubuntu GPU problem](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11263)\r\n- Fix the [Ubuntu CPU problem](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/11249)\r\n- Fix the Mac problem (USE_DIST_KVSTORE=1)\r\n\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @CodingCat @marcoabreu @andrewfayres \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nThis PR contains examples written from the new API.\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres\r\nAll examples pushed here are tested locally on my Mac. It lives in the new package called `org.apache.mxnet.examples`\r\nBe aware: CNN Example is specifically designed to run on GPU. Disable the CPU\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nCreate MKLDNNCopy for copying mkldnn memory\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Create helper that works on mem (MKLDNNCopy)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nAdd unit test for MKLDNNSum helper function\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Add unit test for MKLDNNSum\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-14T05:03:42Z","updated_at":"2018-06-14T17:26:47Z","closed_at":"2018-06-14T17:26:46Z","merged_at":"2018-06-14T17:26:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"a40055eeb98326120642039e29732d2ca39a7610","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11272/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11272/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11272/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/b097d1a7d158f3140d2476ad2f22371b4e279b74","head":{"label":"azai91:test/test-mkldnnsum","ref":"test/test-mkldnnsum","sha":"b097d1a7d158f3140d2476ad2f22371b4e279b74","user":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109348168,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDkzNDgxNjg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"azai91/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"azai91","id":8272546,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNzI1NDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8272546?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91","html_url":"https://github.com/azai91","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azai91/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/azai91/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

PR #11194 \r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n\r\nKnown issue: The CUDNN Convolution operator may throw `CUDNN_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED` when req == \"add\" and `cudnn_tune` != \"off\" with large inputs (e.g. 64K channels). If you encounter such error, please consider setting `cudnn_tune` to \"off\". \r\n\r\nThe above issue applies to both Conv1D and Conv2D, in both mxnet 1.1 and mxnet 1.2. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-14T04:02:28Z","updated_at":"2018-12-22T03:15:48Z","closed_at":"2018-06-14T20:11:26Z","merged_at":"2018-06-14T20:11:26Z","merge_commit_sha":"73ebc762c3dbaa122897d377f128634ec291d3a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11270/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11270/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11270/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/611b793c734120abd69264e414c111fcbbf9290d","head":{"label":"eric-haibin-lin:v1.2.0","ref":"v1.2.0","sha":"611b793c734120abd69264e414c111fcbbf9290d","user":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":54802325,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk1NDgwMjMyNQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nTo get fmod more accurate, I try here to use the standard library implementation.\r\nI think a more portable alternative is to use libmxnet itself via the find lib function and use fmod using ctypes in a similar way. We observe that numerically the results are indentical because the implementation used is the same, instead of numpy / cpython which seems to be implemented differently and hence produce numerical divergences.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\n\r\nSo far Scala users cannot specify the names for NDArrayIter - they are inferred automatically (data_0, data_1, ..., etc)\r\nWe should allow users to do that since the input names are from model.\r\n\r\nA builder class added so as to simplify object construction.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-13T06:51:45Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T23:50:01Z","closed_at":"2018-06-15T23:50:01Z","merged_at":"2018-06-15T23:50:01Z","merge_commit_sha":"02e8a7199fad36b1b4b3da58b44310e5808c7378","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11256/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11256/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11256/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1b14e6cc6263f37d6d034ff655b0081a78ce7442","head":{"label":"yzhliu:scala-nditer","ref":"scala-nditer","sha":"1b14e6cc6263f37d6d034ff655b0081a78ce7442","user":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47767518,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Nzc2NzUxOA==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"yzhliu/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nAs title\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Bump up rtol for fp16 to stablize test_sgd\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nAll encountered failures(3 so far including #10945) occurs when dtype=np.float16, the maximum ratio of error/rtol is ~5, should be a flaky test caused by numeric errors.\r\nThe new rtol value has passed > 24000 runs on GPU.","created_at":"2018-06-12T16:22:05Z","updated_at":"2018-07-19T20:12:41Z","closed_at":"2018-06-17T00:22:48Z","merged_at":"2018-06-17T00:22:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"7210c2cb750f666f6143b34b02635aadbf37ea13","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11246/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11246/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11246/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/c96987564052abe7060f2241e76c0d505fc74b6b","head":{"label":"haojin2:flaky_test_sgd","ref":"flaky_test_sgd","sha":"c96987564052abe7060f2241e76c0d505fc74b6b","user":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114436356,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ0MzYzNTY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"haojin2/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"haojin2","id":11465736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDY1NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11465736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2","html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/haojin2/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/haojin2/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis is the second proposed solution to this: #11123\r\nAdd Java doc support.\r\n@nswamy @yzhliu @andrewfayres\r\nBe aware, I have imported a third party library to generate the Scala doc. Please check the pom file carefully.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-12T01:05:37Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T22:36:26Z","closed_at":"2018-07-03T21:53:07Z","merged_at":"2018-07-03T21:53:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"815eb609add38ad449ce493906cfd4ed16e7785f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11239/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11239/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11239/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/f6aa970619cdf6f90d344218aebece28c702b878","head":{"label":"lanking520:javadoc-fix3","ref":"javadoc-fix3","sha":"f6aa970619cdf6f90d344218aebece28c702b878","user":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123362138,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMzNjIxMzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"lanking520/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lanking520","id":11890922,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODkwOTIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11890922?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520","html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lanking520/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lanking520/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Restores MXNET_GPU_COPY_NTHREADS environmental variable\r\n- [x] This variable has been set to MXNET_GPU_WORKER_THREADS (default = 2) since MXNet v0.10.0, so env_var doc is changed to reflect that\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This MXNET_GPU_COPY_NTHREADS environmental variable was (accidentally) removed in commit 3b517f1 with the value taking the value of MXNET_GPU_WORKER_NTHREADS. Then, shortly afterwards the member variable was itself removed in this PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/6773. Since then, it has been set to MXNET_GPU_WORKER_NTHREADS, which is 2.\r\n- Since this variable controls how many CUDA streams are launched in order to do copying from GPU to GPU, it might be good to bring it back so the user has another knob they can use to tune single-machine multi-GPU training.\r\n- Some experimental evidence that 2 may be better than 1. From running `tools/bandwidth/measure.py` on ResNet-50 with 8 GPUs.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport MXNET_GPU_COPY_NTHREADS=1\r\nINFO:root:iter 1, 0.033930 sec, 5.261591 GB/sec per gpu, error

changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\n\r\nAn adhoc method using try-catch to iterate over gpu devices is used in the tests for `ctx` argument of `mx.random.seed`. This PR replaces it with iterations using recently introduced `mx.context.num_gpus`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThe mxnet AdaGrad implementation currently initializes the state to 0. As the\r\nAdaGrad update normalizes the gradient by the history value, a non-zero history\r\ninitialization is useful as it gives a new degree of freedom to tune the\r\nmagnitude of the first updates of a parameter.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Add initial_accumulator_value argument to

Description ##\r\nThis fixes a memory leak that results from the FeedForward.predict method not properly disposing of the results from NDArray.slice().\r\n\r\n## Testing ##\r\n### Verifying leak exists ###\r\nTo verify that there was a leak in the existing code I created and trained a basic model off of MNIST data then called the predict method inside a while(true) loop then monitored the process's memory usage.\r\n\r\n### Verifying leak fix ###\r\nAfter making the code changes, I repeated the process I had used to verify there was a leak. Memory consumption was much improved and looks to be stable.\r\n\r\n### More testing ###\r\nIn addition to the tests I ran to monitor memory usage, I also ran the existing tests with 'make scalatest'. All tests pass. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nRecreating a PR as the old [one](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/9933) was stuck on CI because of some git conflict that I couldn't resolve.\r\n\r\nAllows profiling of kvstore server through the profiler API with a new variable profile_process\r\n\r\n```mx.profiler.set_config(..., profile_process='server')```\r\nUses kvstore dist's support for sending command to servers to communicate messages from worker to server regarding profiling.\r\n\r\nSee example in common/fit.py\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Changes in c_api and python kvstore to add functions to set profiler configs, state,

Description ##\r\nThis PR has MXNet to ONNX exporter APIs to export MXNet trained models to ONNX protobuf so that those models can be imported in other frameworks for inference.\r\n\r\nTest framework:\r\nCurrently, we import ONNX models in MXNet, then export them to ONNX, import it in MXNet again to verify inference results.\r\n\r\nWorking models:\r\n- Alexnet, Densenet, resnet50, squeezenet, vgg16, vgg19, inception_v1, inception_v2, Googlenet, caffenet, R-CNN\r\n\r\n@spidyDev @anirudhacharya @piiswrong @sandeep-krishnamurthy @nswamy @anirudh2290 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nThis adds a Clojure package for MXNet under a contrib package\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- [ X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [ X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\nThis is the initial commit of the Clojure package in as a contrib project. There will be a period of stabilization, feedback, and contribution. After that, it may graduate to out of contrib.\r\n\r\nThe initial package has been tested by the community in a separate repo prior to this PR https://github.com/gigasquid/clojure-mxnet\r\n\r\nHere is the original issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/8971\r\n\r\nArchitecture & Design:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/MXNet+Clojure\r\n\r\nCurrent List of Package Completion and Contribution Needs\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Clojure+Package+Contribution+Needs\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThere have been areas of improvement noted from feedback on the mailing list.\r\n\r\n- Increased test coverage\r\n- Benchmarks\r\n\r\nIn addition there will be a need to integrate with the Makefile and CI. \r\n\r\nI would like to propose that this initial PR be merged as it represents a working, community tested development milestone and then add on the improvements as separate PRs to allow smaller commits, better visibility, and community involvement.\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-08T18:18:43Z","updated_at":"2018-07-01T18:16:19Z","closed_at":"2018-07-01T04:10:16Z","merged_at":"2018-07-01T04:10:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"8917318dc961c750c5ca650b5d1ca736387e4cdb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11205/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/11205/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/11205/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/6760c905b722db0268debd5d3c0311fe95f3539f","head":{"label":"gigasquid:clojure-package","ref":"clojure-package","sha":"6760c905b722db0268debd5d3c0311fe95f3539f","user":{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113923015,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM5MjMwMTU=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"gigasquid/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gigasquid","id":340299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDI5OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/340299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid","html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gigasquid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gigasquid/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis fixes a memory leak that results from the FeedForward.predict method not properly disposing of the results from NDArray.slice().\r\n\r\n## Testing ##\r\n### Verifying leak exists ###\r\nTo verify that there was a leak in the existing code I created and trained a basic model off of MNIST data then called the predict method inside a while(true) loop then monitored the process's memory usage.\r\n\r\n### Verifying leak fix ###\r\nAfter making the code changes, I repeated the process I had used to verify there was a leak. Memory consumption was much improved and looks to be stable.\r\n\r\n### More testing ###\r\nIn addition to the tests I ran to monitor memory usage, I also ran the existing tests with 'make scalatest'. All tests pass. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\n\r\nIn #9677 Conv1D is mistakenly switched from CUDNN implementation to MXNet implementation. This PR reverts the change. \r\n\r\nThis significantly improves operator speed, and reduce memory usage by half for some cases. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be
