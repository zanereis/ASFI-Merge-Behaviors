What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nNOTE: This PR cherry-picks https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38683 to 3.3\r\n\r\nIn FileSourceStrategy, we add an Alias node to wrap the file metadata fields (e.g. file_name, file_size) in a NamedStruct ([here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileSourceStrategy.scala#L279)). But `CreateNamedStruct` has an override `nullable` value `false` ([here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/complexTypeCreator.scala#L443)), which is different from the `_metadata` struct `nullable` value `true` ([here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/namedExpressions.scala#L467)).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this, by changing `_metadata` column to be always not nullable. Rationale: \r\n1. By definition, `_metadata` for file-based sources is always not null;\r\n2. If users have already persisted this nullable `_metadata` somewhere, then it's totally fine to write non-nullable data to this nullable column.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor stateful streaming, we store the schema in the state store and [check consistency across batches](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateSchemaCompatibilityChecker.scala#L47). To avoid state schema compatibility mismatched, we should keep nullable consistent in `_metadata`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSometimes, the filter condition compares rank-like(e.g. row_number, rank, dense_rank) window functions with number. For example,\r\n```\r\nSELECT *,\r\n         ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY key ORDER BY a) AS rn\r\nFROM Tab1\r\nWHERE rn <= 5\r\n```\r\nWe can extract the limit value 5 for window group and skip rows of window group in `WindowExec`.\r\n\r\nIn short, it supports following pattern:\r\n```\r\nSELECT (... (row_number|rank|dense_rank)()\r\n    OVER (\r\nPARTITION BY ...\r\nORDER BY  ... ) AS rn)\r\nWHERE rn (==|<|<=) k\r\n        AND other conditions\r\n```\r\nFor these three rank-like functions (row_number|rank|dense_rank), the rank of a key computed on dataset always <= its total rows of whole dataset，so we can safely discard rows with rank > k, anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis PR also take over some functions from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34367.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprove the performance.\r\n\r\n**Micro Benchmark**\r\nTPC-DS data size: 2TB.\r\nThis improvement is valid for tpcds q67 and no regression for other test cases.\r\n| TPC-DS Query   | Default(Seconds)  | After(Seconds)  | Speedup(Percent)  |\r\n|  ----  | ----  | ----  | ----  |\r\n|

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose new error class `FAILED_FUNCTION_CALL` for errors that might occur while preparing functions class, for instance during creation of expression instances. Also, the PR propagates `SparkThrowable` to users in handling any exceptions coming from preparations of functions calls.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo improve user experience with Spark SQL, in particular, the PR makes errors more clear.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, it affects the user-facing errors.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"core/testOnly *SparkThrowableSuite\"\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-11-21T13:12:02Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:10:07Z","closed_at":"2022-11-22T07:05:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd1236bce482111743dd5af978d995d584d7a3d0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38744/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38744/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38744/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5a81053a96bc8606b10c6a5b0f4e365e3dbbbc75","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:failed-builtin-func","ref":"failed-builtin-func","sha":"5a81053a96bc8606b10c6a5b0f4e365e3dbbbc75","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR use profile named `-Puser-defined-protoc` to support that users can build and test `protobuf` module by specifying custom `protoc` executables.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAs described in [SPARK-41215](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41215), the latest versions of `protoc` have the minimum version requirements for basic libraries such as `glibc` and `glibcxx`. Because of that it is not possible to test-compile the `protobuf` module out of the box on CentOS 6 or CentOS 7. Instead the following error messages is shown:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] /home/disk1/spark-ut/spark/connector/protobuf/src/test/resources/protobuf/timestamp.proto [0:0]: /tmp/protoc6599263403262688374.exe:

using official pre-release `protoc` binary files is activated by default.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass GitHub Actions\r\n- Manual test on CentOS6u3 and CentOS7u4\r\n```bash\r\nexport PROTOBUF_PROTOC_EXEC_PATH=/path-to-protoc-exe\r\n./build/mvn clean install -pl connector/protobuf -Puser-defined-protoc -am -DskipTests\r\n./build/mvn clean test -pl

Already existing encoders are for top-level and inner classes.\r\n\r\nIn Scala free types including local classes do not have `TypeTag`s (which the existing encoders and Spark `ScalaReflection` in general are based on). New encoders use new runtime-reflection component `LocalTypeImprover` transforming a type having `WeakTypeTag` but not having `TypeTag` into the one having `TypeTag` based on the corresponding `ClassTag` (e.g. it transforms `TypeRef(NoPrefix, TypeName(\"Local\"), List())` into `TypeRef(NoPrefix, TypeName(\"$Local$1\"), List())` for a local class `Local`).\r\n\r\n<strike>Sadly, this will not always work with type aliases of local classes because Scala runtime reflection [not always](https://gist.github.com/DmytroMitin/51b3978fafe79957c2649ab114c74f9b) supports dealiasing (`.dealias`) such kind of type aliases (on contrary to aliases for top-level/inner classes and on contrary to compile-time reflection). This is a limitation of Scala runtime reflection. (For example see that aliases do not work in [tests](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38740/files#diff-777864577010260134ae949c0c65db65b6d4ae562f29cffe47a3d1420e4dd090R255-R286) but do work [here](https://gist.github.com/DmytroMitin/56044515e031fcf1e977ab213013861d).)</strike> _I moved dealiasing from runtime to compile time (introducing `DeepDealiaser` component) and now encoders work even for type aliases of local classes._\r\n\r\nSince such type improvement should be applied to a type and its type arguments recursively, new macro-implemented type class `DeepClassTag` is introduced. \r\n\r\nSince for a local class nested into an outer class (not object) the link to the outer class is saved in a private field `$outer` (corresponding to the 1st argument of the local-class primary constructor), for encoding, a new expression type `PrivateFieldInvoke` is proposed similarly to existing `Invoke` and `StaticInvoke`. For decoding, existing expression type `NewInstance` is enough. For inner classes `$outer` is handled transparently by Scala reflection but for local classes Java reflection and manual handling seems the only option. For a local class nested into an outer object, `Invoke`/`NewInstance` are enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

However, when `spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning = true`, Spark UI does not show correct final DAG due to lack of final sub-plans (under IMR) submissions (into UI).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning` enables AQE optimizations under `InMemoryRelation`(IMR) nodes. Sample query in Jira has IMR node on both `BroadcastHashJoin` legs. However, \r\nwhen `spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning = true`, following datas are missed due to lack of final sub-plans (under IMR) submissions (into UI).\r\n- Physical operators' SQLMetrics (before AdaptiveSparkPlan) are missed such as Exchange and HashAggregate on left BHJ leg and HashAggregate on right BHJ leg,\r\n- WSCG blocks are missed on left BHJ leg, \r\n- AQEShuffleRead node is missed on left BHJ leg.\r\n\r\n**DAG before fix:**\r\n<img width=\"100\" alt=\"DAG when AQE=ON and AQECachedDFSupport=ON without fix\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1437738/202984370-c179707a-c091-4133-adb6-d5009c98875a.png\">\r\n\r\n**DAG after fix:**\r\n<img width=\"100\" alt=\"DAG when AQE=ON and AQECachedDFSupport=ON with fix\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1437738/202984481-a63ba5e2-fc66-4dc7-98a0-f2233a93e5c8.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nCurrently, Spark UI does not show final DAG when `spark.sql.optimizer.canChangeCachedPlanOutputPartitioning = true` so this causes some physical operators metrics as missed. This PR aims to fix this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nSpecific UT Coverage will be added (In

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `_merge_type` method to allow upcast from any `AtomicType` to `StringType` similar to Cast.scala (https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/Cast.scala#L297).\r\n\r\nThis allows us to avoid TypeError errors in the case when it is okay to merge types. \r\nFor instance, examples below used to fail with TypeError \"Can not merge type ... and ...\" but pass with this patch.\r\n \r\n```python\r\nspark.createDataFrame([[1.33, 1], [\"2.1\", 1]])\r\n\r\nspark.createDataFrame([({1: True}, 1), ({\"2\": False}, 3)])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt also seems to be okay to merge map keys with different types but I would like to call it out explicitly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis makes the behaviour between PySpark and Arrow execution more consistent. For example, arrow can handle type upcasts while PySpark cannot.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nUsers may notice that examples with schema inference in PySpark DataFrames, that used to fail due to TypeError, run successfully. This is due to extended type merge handling when one of the values is of StringType.\r\n\r\nWhen merging AtomicType values with StringType values, the final merged type will be StringType. For example, a combination of double and string values in a column would be cast to StringType:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Both values 1.33 and 2.1 will be cast to strings\r\nspark.createDataFrame([[1.33, 1], [\"2.1\", 1]])\r\n\r\n# Result:\r\n# [\"1.33\", 1]\r\n# [\"2.1\", 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this also applies to nested types. For example, \r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Throws TypeError \"Can not merge type\"\r\nspark.createDataFrame([({1: True}, 1), ({\"2\": False}, 3)])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark.createDataFrame([({1: True}, 1), ({\"2\": False}, 3)])\r\n\r\n# Result:\r\n# {\"1\": true}  1\r\n# {\"2\": false}  3\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

However, `ToBinary`'s default constructor does not check whether the format expression is foldable, so the code that creates `ToBinary`'s own replacement expression fails with an assertion failure.\r\n\r\n`ToBinary` is not typically instantiated using the default constructor. The function registry uses the second auxiliary constructor, which does check whether format is foldable. The code that creates `ToBinary`'s replacement expression assumes this second auxiliary constructor is always used.\r\n\r\n`TryToBinary` cannot use `ToBinary`'s second auxiliary constructor because it needs to set `nullOnInvalidFormat` to `true`.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the above example will throw a more useful error message:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> SELECT try_to_binary(col1, col2) from values ('abc', 'utf-8') as data(col1, col2);\r\nThe 'format' parameter of function 'try_to_binary' needs to be a string literal.; line 1 pos 7\r\nspark-sql> \r\n```\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe arrow collect code path for connect contains a bug where it would always fall back to JSON.

This has been fixed by doing explicit null checks and by reordering the checks in `SparkConnectStreamHandler.processAsArrowBatches`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe previous code had a bug and would always fallback to JSON.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nI added a new test, and I re-enabled the python test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the metrics issue for streaming query when DSv1 streaming source and DSv2 streaming source are co-used. If the streaming query has both DSv1 streaming source and DSv2 streaming source, only DSv1 streaming source produced correct metrics.\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in ProgressReporter that it tries to match logical node for DSv2 streaming source with OffsetHolder (association map has OffsetHolder instances for DSv2 streaming sources), which will be never matched. Given that physical node for DSv2 streaming source contains both source information and metrics, we can simply deduce all the necessary information from the physical node rather than trying to find the source from association map.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe logic of collecting metrics does not collect metrics for DSv2 streaming sources properly.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew test case.","created_at":"2022-11-18T21:08:54Z","updated_at":"2022-11-19T13:42:51Z","closed_at":"2022-11-19T13:42:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"88ab8f69fbdb9a06f46be7da6ac3abc8bddaf1a4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFix out of sync generated files for Python.\r\n\r\nThis happens on a rare case for protobuf version change. https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38693 downgraded protobuf versions.\r\n\r\nThere were something not generated before but with the protobuf version downgraded that was generated (and this is why there was no merge conflict). However [the downgrading PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38693) was based on old code before https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38638 so the protobuf generates based on stale code which leads to stale generated files. \r\n\r\nThe way to better avoid this is when upon such change, it should lock the repo (partially on some directory to reduce impact), do the work, merge, and enforce pending PR to rebase. However this is not feasible (or too heavy) for concurrent development on Spark repo.  \r\n\r\nAnother approach is to ask relevant PR to rebase, re-generate for python then merge. Though there could be still a gap here (a PR merged right right before merge button clicked) but that is minimized. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nFix out of sync generated files for Python.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNO\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the broken metrics when the streaming query has CTE and DSv1 streaming source, via applying InlineCTE manually against analyzed plan when collecting metrics.\r\n\r\nSuppose a streaming query contains below part as batch side which is joined with streaming source:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith batch_tbl as (\r\n  SELECT col1, col2 FROM parquet_tbl\r\n)\r\n\r\nSELECT col1 AS key, col2 as value_batch FROM batch_tbl\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, Spark adds WithCTE node with CTERelationDef and CTERelationRef when there is a usage of CTE. Below is an analyzed plan:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWriteToMicroBatchDataSource MemorySink, 2cbb2afa-6513-4a23-b4c2-37910fc9cdf9, Append, 0\r\n+- Project [key#15, value_stream#16, value_batch#9L]\r\n   +- Join Inner, (cast(key#15 as bigint) = key#8L)\r\n      :- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.parquet_streaming_tbl\r\n      :  +- Project [key#55 AS key#15, value_stream#56 AS value_stream#16]\r\n      :     +- Relation spark_catalog.default.parquet_streaming_tbl[key#55,value_stream#56] parquet\r\n      +- WithCTE\r\n         :- CTERelationDef 0, false\r\n         :  +- SubqueryAlias batch_tbl\r\n         :     +- Project [col1#10L, col2#11L]\r\n         :        +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.parquet_tbl\r\n         :           +- Relation spark_catalog.default.parquet_tbl[col1#10L,col2#11L] parquet\r\n         +- Project [col1#10L AS key#8L, col2#11L AS value_batch#9L]\r\n            +- SubqueryAlias batch_tbl\r\n               +- CTERelationRef 0, true, [col1#10L, col2#11L]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, there are 3 leaf nodes in the plan, but the actual sources in the leaf nodes are 2. During the optimization, inlining CTE happens and there are 2 leaf nodes. Below is the optimized plan:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWriteToDataSourceV2 MicroBatchWrite[epoch: 0, writer: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.streaming.sources.MemoryStreamingWrite@622c7c7f]\r\n+- Project [key#55, value_stream#56, value_batch#9L]\r\n   +- Join Inner, (cast(key#55 as bigint) = key#8L)\r\n      :- Filter isnotnull(key#55)\r\n      :  +- Relation spark_catalog.default.parquet_streaming_tbl[key#55,value_stream#56] parquet\r\n      +- Project [col1#10L AS key#8L, col2#11L AS value_batch#9L]\r\n         +- Filter isnotnull(col1#10L)\r\n            +- Relation spark_catalog.default.parquet_tbl[col1#10L,col2#11L] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nHence executed plan will also have 2 leaf nodes, which does not match with the number of leaf nodes in analyzed plan, and ProgressReporter will give up collecting metrics.\r\n\r\nApplying InlineCTE against analyzed plan during collecting metrics would resolve this. For example, below is the logical plan which applies InlineCTE against above analyzed plan.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWriteToMicroBatchDataSource MemorySink, 2cbb2afa-6513-4a23-b4c2-37910fc9cdf9, Append, 0\r\n+- Project [key#15, value_stream#16, value_batch#9L]\r\n   +- Join Inner, (cast(key#15 as bigint) = key#8L)\r\n      :- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.parquet_streaming_tbl\r\n      :  +- Project [key#55 AS key#15, value_stream#56 AS value_stream#16]\r\n      :     +- Relation spark_catalog.default.parquet_streaming_tbl[key#55,value_stream#56] parquet\r\n      +- Project [col1#10L AS key#8L, col2#11L AS value_batch#9L]\r\n         +- SubqueryAlias batch_tbl\r\n            +- SubqueryAlias batch_tbl\r\n               +- Project [col1#10L, col2#11L]\r\n                  +- SubqueryAlias spark_catalog.default.parquet_tbl\r\n                     +- Relation spark_catalog.default.parquet_tbl[col1#10L,col2#11L] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this is only required for the case where there is at least one of DSv1 streaming source in the streaming query. If streaming query only contains DSv2 data sources as streaming sources, ProgressReporter can just pick up dedicated physical node(s) from executed plan.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe metrics in streaming query are broken if the query contains CTE. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch

The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch changes `currentBatchId` when `MicroBatchExecution` tries to resume from late batch from offset log. Previously it takes `latestBatchId` from offset log. This patch changes it to `latestCommittedBatchId`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWe have customer streaming job which is unable to restart from failed status after it failed to commit delta files. For example, if previous run failed to commit 14.delta, when the job restarted, it tried to read 14.delta. Because 14.delta doesn't exist (not committed), the job cannot be restarted to resume from late batch.\r\n\r\nWhen `MicroBatchExecution` populates start offsets, it reads late batch id (`latestBatchId`) from offset log and committed batch id (`latestCommittedBatchId`) from commit log. Currently if `latestCommittedBatchId` == `latestBatchId` - 1, it means that we resume from late batch. But it uses `latestBatchId` as `currentBatchId` to run batch. Obviously, `latestBatchId` is 14 for above example, and `latestCommittedBatchId` is 13. \r\n\r\nBecause `IncrementalExecution` uses `currentBatchId` to load checkpointed states, it tries to load version 14 of delta files. But version 14 is not committed in late run. So resume run always fails because it cannot load non existing delta file.\r\n\r\nWe should use `latestCommittedBatchId` as `currentBatchId` instead of `latestBatchId` for the case resuming last batch.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR upgrades Kafka to 3.3.1 release.\r\n\r\nThe new default partitioner keeps track of how many bytes are produced per-partition and once the amount exceeds `batch.size`, it switches to the next partition. For spark kafka tests, this will result in records being sent to only one partition in some tests.\r\n`KafkaTestUtils.producerConfiguration` is modified to use `DefaultPartitioner`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nKafka 3.3.1 release has new features along with bug fixes: https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-3-3-0-new-features-and-updates/\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis is a PR for improvement\r\nWhen a subquery references the outer query's aggregate functions,  in some cases, it ends up introducing extra aggregate functions which are not needed. Though they would get eventually eliminated in the optimizer, but atleast in analyzer phase would add an extra project node etc.\r\nThe change is in the code of identification of OuterReference in subquery.scala.\r\nCurrently whenever an aggregate expression is found, it is assumed to be the Outer Reference.\r\nWith this change,  the code checks whether the parent Expression can also be potentially part of the OuterReference too.\r\nSo if we consider a query\r\nselect cos (sum (a) ) , b from t1 having exists select 1 from t2 where x = cos ( sum(a) ) \r\n\r\nthe OuterReference detected would be cos ( sum(a) ) instead of just sum(a).\r\nAs a result, no extra aggregate would be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo avoid adding unnecessary aggregate in outer query thereby reducing the number of expressions to analyze, clone and also avoid adding an extra project node.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nRan the precheckin tests and added new tests.","created_at":"2022-11-18T18:36:29Z","updated_at":"2023-03-20T00:20:51Z","closed_at":"2023-03-20T00:20:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b6a1066120dd03fd44c0facbc4bacdec2822ae7c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38714/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38714/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38714/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/202e3598e89f9ff92dbe2275a7118b0e2898211b","head":{"label":"ahshahid:SPARK-41141","ref":"SPARK-41141","sha":"202e3598e89f9ff92dbe2275a7118b0e2898211b","user":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105594707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU1OTQ3MDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"ahshahid/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ahshahid","id":12415848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDE1ODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12415848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid","html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ahshahid/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ahshahid/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nToday, our SQL parser only supports PIVOT/UNPIVOT at the end of the FROM clause. This is quite limited and it's better to allow PIVOT/UNPIVOT in the join children as well. As a reference, snowflake supports it: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constructs/from.html\r\n\r\nThis PR makes PIVOT/UNPIVOT the same level as JOIN. Wherever you can use JOIN to extend a relation, you can also use PIVOT/UNPIVOT. Many SQL syntaxes are supported after this PR\r\n```\r\nFROM t1 PIVOT/UNPIVOT ... JOIN t2  // pivot/unpivot the left table\r\nFROM t1 JOIN t2 PIVOT/UNPIVOT ...  // pivot/unpivot the join result. This is the same before this PR\r\nFROM t1 JOIN (t2 PIVOT/UNPIVOT ...)  // pivot/unpivot the right table\r\nFROM t1 PIVOT/UNPIVOT ... PIVOT/UNPIVOT // nested pivot/unpivot\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nmake PIVOT/UNPIVOT syntax more flexible\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, new SQL syntax without any breaking change\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew parser

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. To improve user experience with Spark SQL via\r\n    - Using Spark as remote service (microservice).\r\n    - Write SQL code that will power reports, dashboards, charts and other data presentation solutions that need to account for criteria modifiable by users through an interface.\r\n    - Build a generic integration layer based on the SQL API. The goal is to expose managed data to a wide application ecosystem with a microservice architecture. It is only natural in such a setup to ask for modular and reusable SQL code, that can be executed repeatedly with different parameter values.\r\n\r\n2. To achieve feature parity with other systems that support named parameters:\r\n    - Redshift: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/data-api.html#data-api-calling\r\n    - BigQuery: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/parameterized-queries#api\r\n    - MS DBSQL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/user/queries/query-parameters\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, this is an extension of the existing APIs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *PlanParserSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AnalysisSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *QueryCompilationErrorsSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-11-18T10:00:08Z","updated_at":"2022-12-15T06:14:54Z","closed_at":"2022-12-15T06:14:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4a64c0aaeff51424d29750b955ca30ca44aa2e95","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38712/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38712/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38712/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d1198f28c9ff1a4e90e2dc3ce6d58c0d502e607","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:parameterized-sql","ref":"parameterized-sql","sha":"4d1198f28c9ff1a4e90e2dc3ce6d58c0d502e607","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExecutorAllocationManager only record count for speculative task, `stageAttemptToNumSpeculativeTasks` increment when speculative task submit, and only decrement when speculative task end.\r\nIf task finished before speculative task start, the speculative task will never be scheduled, which will cause leak of `stageAttemptToNumSpeculativeTasks` and mislead the calculation of target executors.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by add task index in `SparkListenerSpeculativeTaskSubmitted` event, and record speculative task with task index when submitted, task index should be removed when speculative task start or task finished(whether it is speculative or not)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo fix idle executors caused by pending speculative task from task that has been finished\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nDeveloperApi `SparkListenerSpeculativeTaskSubmitted` add taskIndex with default value -1\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd a comprehensive unit test.\r\nPass the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nExecutorAllocationManager only record count for speculative task, `stageAttemptToNumSpeculativeTasks` increment when speculative task submit, and only decrement when speculative task end.\r\nIf task finished before speculative task start, the speculative task will never be scheduled, which will cause leak of `stageAttemptToNumSpeculativeTasks` and mislead the calculation of target executors.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by add task index in `SparkListenerSpeculativeTaskSubmitted` event, and record speculative task with task index, when

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIgnore the SparkListenerTaskEnd with Reason \"Resubmitted\" in AppStatusListener to avoid memory leak\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor a long running spark thriftserver,  LiveExecutor will be accumulated in the deadExecutors HashMap and cause message event queue processing slowly. \r\nFor a every task, actually always sent out a `SparkListenerTaskStart` event and a `SparkListenerTaskEnd` event, they are always pairs. But in a executor lost situation, it send out event like following steps.\r\n\r\na) There was a pair of task start and task end event which were fired for the task (let us call it Tr)\r\nb) When executor which ran Tr was lost, while stage is still running, a task end event with reason `Resubmitted`  is fired for Tr.\r\nc) Subsequently, a new task start and task end will be fired for the retry of Tr.\r\n\r\nThe processing of the `Resubmitted` task end event in AppStatusListener can lead to negative `LiveStage.activeTasks` since there's no corresponding `SparkListenerTaskStart` event for each of them. The negative activeTasks will make the stage always remains in the live stage list as it can never meet the condition activeTasks == 0. This in turn causes the dead executor to never be cleaned up if that live stage's submissionTime is less than the dead executor's removeTime( see isExecutorActiveForLiveStages). Since this kind of `SparkListenerTaskEnd` is useless here, we simply ignore it.\r\n\r\nCheck  [SPARK-41187](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41187) for evidences.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT Added\r\nTest in thriftserver env\r\n\r\n### The way to reproduce\r\nI try to reproduce it in spark shell, but it is a little bit handy\r\n1.  start spark-shell , set spark.dynamicAllocation.maxExecutors=2 for convient\r\n` bin/spark-shell  --driver-java-options \"-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8006\"`\r\n2. run a job with shuffle\r\n `sc.parallelize(1 to 1000, 10).map { x => Thread.sleep(1000) ; (x % 3, x) }.reduceByKey((a, b) => a + b).collect()`\r\n3. After some ShuffleMapTask finished, kill one or two executor to let tasks resubmitted\r\n4. check by heap dump or debug or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34688 that adds a switch to turn on and off the namedtuple hack.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThere are still behaviour differences between regular pickle and Cloudpickle e.g., bug fixes from the upstream. It's safer to have a switch to turn on and off for the time being.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis remains as an internal environment so ideally no. In fact the main change itself was the internal change too.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSet executorEnv OMP_NUM_THREADS to be spark.task.cpus by default for spark executor JVM processes.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThis is for limiting the thread number for OpenBLAS routine to the number of cores assigned to this executor because some spark ML algorithms calls OpenBlAS via netlib-java,\r\ne.g.:\r\nSpark ALS estimator training calls LAPACK API `dppsv` (internally it will call BLAS lib), if it calls OpenBLAS lib, by default OpenBLAS will try to use all CPU cores. But spark will launch multiple spark tasks on a spark worker, and each spark task might call `dppsv` API at the same time, and each call internally it will create multiple threads (threads number equals to CPU cores), this causes CPU oversubscription.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to:

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nToday, Spark is very conservative and uses the analyzed plan instead of the optimized plan as the cache key. Many cache opportunities are missed.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates `SparkSessionExtensions` to allow people to inject custom plan normalization rules. Users can pick some safe optimizer rules, or implement new rules based on their business needs, to do plan normalization and increase the cache hit rate.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR fixes a long-standing parser bug in Spark: `JOIN` should take precedence over comma when combining relations. For example, `FROM t1, t2 JOIN t3` should result to `t1 X (t2 X t3)`. However, it's `(t1 X t2) X t3` today.\r\n\r\nYou can easily verify this behavior in other databases by running the query `SELECT * FROM t1, t2 JOIN t3 ON t1.c and t3.c`. It should fail as `t1.c` is not available when joining t2 and t3. I tested MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL, all of them fail, but Spark can run this query due to the wrong join order.\r\n\r\nHowever, this bug has a large impact: it changes the join order which can lead to worse performance or unexpected analysis errors. To be safe, this PR hides the fix under a new ANSI sub-config.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, as the fix is turned off by default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

(row_number|rank|dense_rank)()\r\n    OVER (\r\nORDER BY  ... ) AS rn)\r\nWHERE rn (==|<|<=) k\r\n        AND other conditions\r\n```\r\nFor these three rank functions (row_number|rank|dense_rank), the rank of a key computed on dataset always <= its total rows of whole dataset，so we can safely discard rows with rank > k, anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis PR also take over some functions from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/34367.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. reduce the shuffle write\r\n2. solve skewed-window problem.\r\n3. improve the performance and TPC-DS.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nJust update the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to assign the proper name `COLUMN_ALREADY_EXISTS ` to the legacy error class `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1233 `, and modify test suite to use `checkError()` which checks the error class name, context and etc. Also this PR improves the error message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProper name improves user experience w/ Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes an user-facing error message. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified test suites:\r\n```\r\n$ $ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n$ build/sbt -Phive-2.3 \"testOnly

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn FileSourceStrategy, we add an Alias node to wrap the file metadata fields (e.g. file_name, file_size) in a NamedStruct ([here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/FileSourceStrategy.scala#L279)). But `CreateNamedStruct` has an override `nullable` value `false` ([here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/complexTypeCreator.scala#L443)), which is different from the `_metadata` struct `nullable` value `true` ([here](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/expressions/namedExpressions.scala#L467)).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this, by changing `_metadata` column to be always not nullable. Rationale: \r\n1. By definition, `_metadata` for file-based sources is always not null;\r\n2. If users have already persisted this nullable `_metadata` somewhere, then it's totally fine to write non-nullable data to this nullable column.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor stateful streaming, we store the schema in the state store and [check consistency across batches](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/streaming/state/StateSchemaCompatibilityChecker.scala#L47). To avoid state schema compatibility mismatched, we should keep nullable consistent in `_metadata`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew UT\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-17T06:08:44Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T01:29:30Z","closed_at":"2022-11-22T00:54:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"68034377b4ea9619e9b1255b3d3e2dae055392f5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38683/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38683/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38683/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f2173f2987fe1245a853cbbc7b24cfea01ea68db","head":{"label":"Yaohua628:spark-41151","ref":"spark-41151","sha":"f2173f2987fe1245a853cbbc7b24cfea01ea68db","user":{"login":"Yaohua628","id":79476540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628","html_url":"https://github.com/Yaohua628","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":425586598,"node_id":"R_kgDOGV3vpg","name":"spark","full_name":"Yaohua628/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Yaohua628","id":79476540,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDc2NTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/79476540?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628","html_url":"https://github.com/Yaohua628","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Yaohua628/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Yaohua628/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOptimize like any and like all predicate expressions to a balanced expression tree predicate instead of left recursive trees predicate using exists API.\r\nFor example, expression `col like any ('abc%', '%xyz', \"%mn%\", \"abc\")`, before this PR will be optimize to `StartsWith(col, \"abc\") OR EndsWith(col, \"xyz\") OR Contains(col, \"mn\") OR EqualTo(\"abc\")`, after this PR will be optimize to `(StartsWith(col, \"abc\") OR EndsWith(col, \"xyz\")) OR (Contains(col, \"mn\") OR EqualTo(\"abc\"))`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nTwo changes:\r\n1. Make sure connect's arrow result path properly deals with errors, and avoids hangs.\r\n2. Fix a common source of non-serializable exceptions in `SparkConnectStreamHandler`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe current Arrow result code path for connect assumes no error can happen during execution. As a result it will hang when an error occurs.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a UT.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-17T04:12:13Z","updated_at":"2022-11-18T00:43:55Z","closed_at":"2022-11-18T00:43:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"be71344b19b3f426d34c98c1fa8936a28fc173e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zhengruifeng","id":7322292,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMjIyOTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7322292?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng","html_url":"https://github.com/zhengruifeng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhengruifeng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38681/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38681/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38681/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1eace59c85a5d966fb1f960b4bf8dc30c2bb5350","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-41165","ref":"SPARK-41165","sha":"1eace59c85a5d966fb1f960b4bf8dc30c2bb5350","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRule `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` should not push an anti-join below an `Aggregate` when the translated (cf. `aliasMap`) join conditions become ambiguous w.r.t. to both join sides.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis example fails with `distinct()`, and succeeds without `distinct()`, but both queries are identical:\r\n```scala\r\nval ids = Seq(1, 2, 3).toDF(\"id\").distinct()\r\nval result = ids.withColumn(\"id\", $\"id\" + 1).join(ids, \"id\", \"left_anti\").collect()\r\nassert(result.length == 1)\r\n```\r\nWith `distinct()`, rule `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` creates a join condition `(id#774 + 1) = id#774`, which can never be true. This effectively removes the anti-join.\r\n\r\n**Before this PR:**\r\nThe anti-join is fully removed from the plan.\r\n```\r\n*(2) HashAggregate(keys=[id#4], functions=[], output=[id#6])\r\n+- AQEShuffleRead coalesced\r\n   +- ShuffleQueryStage 0\r\n      +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#4, 200), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS, [plan_id=19]\r\n         +- *(1) HashAggregate(keys=[id#4], functions=[], output=[id#4])\r\n            +- *(1) LocalTableScan [id#4]\r\n```\r\nThis is caused by `PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin` adding join condition `(id#774 + 1) = id#774`:\r\n```\r\n=== Applying Rule org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.optimizer.PushDownLeftSemiAntiJoin ===\r\n!Join LeftAnti, (id#776 = id#774)                  'Aggregate [id#774], [(id#774 + 1) AS id#776]\r\n!:- Aggregate [id#774], [(id#774 + 1) AS id#776]   +- 'Join LeftAnti, ((id#774 + 1) = id#774)\r\n!:  +- LocalRelation [id#774]                         :- LocalRelation [id#774]\r\n!+- Aggregate [id#774], [id#774]                      +- Aggregate [id#774], [id#774]\r\n!   +- LocalRelation [id#774]                            +- LocalRelation [id#774]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After this PR:**\r\nJoin condition `id#776 = id#774` is still translated into `(id#774 + 1) = id#774` but recognized as ambiguous to both sides of the prospect join and hence not pushed down. The rule is then not applied any more.\r\n\r\nThe final plan contains the anti-join:\r\n```\r\n*(4) BroadcastHashJoin [id#53], [id#51], LeftAnti, BuildRight, false\r\n:- *(4) HashAggregate(keys=[id#51], functions=[], output=[id#53])\r\n:  +- AQEShuffleRead coalesced\r\n:     +- ShuffleQueryStage 0\r\n:        +- Exchange hashpartitioning(id#51, 200), ENSURE_REQUIREMENTS,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support `bool` type for `SparkSession.builder.config` when building the new `SparkSession`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, Python `bool` type `True` or `False` is not working correctly, since JVM side only treat the String type of \"true\" or \"false\" as a valid option value.\r\n\r\nSo, this PR basically fix the current behavior as below:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```python\r\n>>> s1 = spark.builder.config(\"spark.sql.pyspark.jvmStacktrace.enabled\", True).getOrCreate()\r\n>>> s1.conf.get(\"spark.sql.pyspark.jvmStacktrace.enabled\")\r\n'True'  # invalid value, no effect for options.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n```python\r\n>>> s1 = spark.builder.config(\"spark.sql.pyspark.jvmStacktrace.enabled\", True).getOrCreate()\r\n>>> s1.conf.get(\"spark.sql.pyspark.jvmStacktrace.enabled\")\r\n'true'  # the lower case \"true\" only valid for options.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis patch adds error message to `SchemaColumnConvertNotSupportedException`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nJust found the fact that `SchemaColumnConvertNotSupportedException` doesn't have any error message is annoying for debugging.\r\n\r\nIn stack trace, we only see `SchemaColumnConvertNotSupportedException` but don't know what column is wrong.\r\n\r\nAfter this change, we should be able to see it, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.SchemaColumnConvertNotSupportedException: column: [_1], physicalType: INT32, logicalType: bigint\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting tests.\r\n","created_at":"2022-11-16T04:57:13Z","updated_at":"2022-11-16T20:29:56Z","closed_at":"2022-11-16T20:29:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"826733233b0554ac8aab3ebf284ddd1d2696b3b7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38669/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38669/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38669/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/84d8e1c266897b94fe320d9ce3b3614ac19d34f3","head":{"label":"viirya:add_error_message","ref":"add_error_message","sha":"84d8e1c266897b94fe320d9ce3b3614ac19d34f3","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to remove the class `TypeCheckFailure` since it is not used anymore after migration onto the `DataTypeMismatch` class

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to assign a name to `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1042`.\r\n\r\nThus, in this PR we integrate `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1042` into `DATATYPE_MISMATCH.WRONG_NUM_ARGS` since it's duplicated.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe legacy error classes were temporary named to cover the all exceptions by error class, so we

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis modifies various operators that can accept _untrusted_ input (e.g. DSv2 sources, UDFs) so that they can perform null checks on their input, guaranteeing that if an input is _annotated_ as non-null, it _actually_ contains no NULL values. Currently all operators in Spark assume that the schema/nullability annotations are correct, which makes sense for operators consuming the output of other internal operators, but doesn't necessarily make sense for operators handling the output of user defined code.\r\n\r\nFor UDFs/UDAFs such as `ScalaUDF`, this simply adds a null check in all cases when the output is non-null, since a UDF will always be untrusted. For other sources of introducing untrusted values, such as DSv2, the values are accepted into Spark by way of `BoundReference`. To handle this situation, `Expression` nodes are enhanced with the concept of \"trusting\" their input, which is set to false in the case of user-provided inputs. If the input is both non-null _and_ untrusted, the extra null-check is generated. There are also minor enhancements to allow for passing the SQL-friendly name down to the `BoundReference`, so that a user-friendly name can be generated in the error message.\r\n\r\nAn example error message, when projecting the string field \"s\" from the struct field \"nest\", is like:\r\n\r\n```\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: The value at nest.`s` cannot be null, but a NULL was found. This is typically caused by the presence of a NULL value when the schema indicates the value should be non-null. Check that the input data matches the schema and/or that UDFs which can return null have a nullable return schema.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is in contrast to the approach originally proposed in #37634; see the discussion there for some more context on why this approach was chosen ([in particular this comment](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/37634#issuecomment-1314561335)).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is needed to help users decipher the error message; currently a `NullPointerException` without any message is thrown, which provides the user no guidance on what they've done wrong, and typically leads them to believe there is a bug in Spark. See the Jira for a specific example of how this behavior can be triggered and what the exception looks like currently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, in the case that a user has a data-schema mismatch, they will not get a much more helpful error message.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to assign the proper name `INVALID_WHERE_CONDITION ` to the legacy error class `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2440 `, and modify test suite to use `checkError()` which checks the error class name, context and etc. Also this PR improves the error message.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProper name improves user experience w/ Spark SQL.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes an user-facing error message. \r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running the modified tests:\r\n```\r\n$ build/sbt \"test:testOnly *AnalysisErrorSuite\"\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite\"\r\n```","created_at":"2022-11-14T10:57:20Z","updated_at":"2022-11-15T11:58:50Z","closed_at":"2022-11-15T11:58:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e878de901b6ca1d58b72471e28ed9471114e0ab6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38656/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/38656/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/38656/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/abb9ba17adc1971580ad237b252264b900bf8236","head":{"label":"MaxGekk:invalid-where-condition-2","ref":"invalid-where-condition-2","sha":"abb9ba17adc1971580ad237b252264b900bf8236","user":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123690489,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjM2OTA0ODk=","name":"spark","full_name":"MaxGekk/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MaxGekk","id":1580697,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODA2OTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1580697?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk","html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MaxGekk/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MaxGekk/spark","description":"Mirror
