We should be able to pass options for both `from_protobuf()` and `to_protobuf()`. \r\nThis PR fixes various gaps: \r\n \r\n - In Scala `to_protobuf()` didn't have a way to pass options.\r\n - In Scala `from_protobuf()` that takes Java class name didn't allow options. \r\n - In Python, `from_protobuf()` that uses Java class name didn't propagate options.\r\n - In Python `to_protobuf()` didn't pass options.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nOptions are important part of how Protobuf functions behave (e.g. we need to set recursive depth).

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn ANSI SQL mode, Round/Bround should return an error on integer overflow.\r\nNote this PR is for integer only. Once it is merge, I will create one follow-up PR for all the rest integral types: byte, short, and long.\r\nAlso, the function ceil and floor accepts decimal type input, so there is no need to change them.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIn ANSI SQL mode, integer overflow should cause error instead of returning an unreasonable result.\r\nFor example, `round(2147483647, -1)` should return error instead of returning `-2147483646`\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, in ANSI SQL mode, SQL function Round and Bround will return an error on integer overflow\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nUT","created_at":"2023-01-13T04:33:19Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T17:40:46Z","closed_at":"2023-01-13T17:40:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e4bedc8375bfe3f0b851f1a06d23f64f5146061","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39546/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39546/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39546/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/44db19a65e76df3ed7a9179c776297afa131722f","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:fixRound","ref":"fixRound","sha":"44db19a65e76df3ed7a9179c776297afa131722f","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39469 that uses the same logic with PySpark: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/baa6fa9b148467bfc83e6c2d22ea9fd9fa5b4564/python/pyspark/sql/pandas/conversion.py#L546-L631\r\n\r\nand reeanbles skipped test `test_create_dataframe_from_pandas_with_timestamp`.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a bug together by doing this. Nave datetime was inferred as `TimestampNTZType` before but now it is inferred as `TimestampType` that is matched with the regular PySpark.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo deduplicate the changes in the future, and maintainability.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo to end users.\r\nIt matches the behaviour to the existing PySpark's `createDataFrame(pdf)`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nReenabled a skipped test, and existing test added in the previous PR should cover this.","created_at":"2023-01-13T03:33:10Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:33Z","closed_at":"2023-01-13T06:20:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0424abb82510f32dd58a64ad3696ae433952c71f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39544/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39544/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39544/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6455f558c82ccb6ca46cea067eb91f92a130ada5","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-42028-followup","ref":"SPARK-42028-followup","sha":"6455f558c82ccb6ca46cea067eb91f92a130ada5","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently `KeyGroupedPartitioning#partitionValuesOpt` is of type: `Option[Seq[InternalRow]]`. This refactors it into \r\n`Seq[InternalRow]`. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt's unnecessary to use `Option` for the field. Originally I was thinking to use `None` for the case when all the input partitions are implicitly matched, so that we can skip comparing them in `EnsureRequirements`. However, I think it is not really a use case, and we can instead use `Seq.empty` for that if it comes up.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to rename the following environment variables and some legacy variable `amplap` from Apache Spark 3.4.0.\r\n- `AMPLAB_JENKINS` -> `SPARK_JENKINS`\r\n- `AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_TOOL` -> `SPARK_JENKINS_BUILD_TOOL`\r\n- `AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_SCALA_PROFILE` -> `SPARK_JENKINS_BUILD_SCALA_PROFILE`\r\n- `AMPLAB_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE` -> `SPARK_JENKINS_BUILD_PROFILE`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nAs of today, Apache Spark's the only Jenkins farm is `Apple Silicon Jenkins` Farm on `Scaleway`.\r\n- https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n\r\nIt's weird to use `AMPLAB_XXX` in new irrelevant environment.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, this is a dev-only change for new branch-3.4 and master.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs.\r\n\r\nActually, there is no occurrence of `AMPLAB_` after this PR.\r\n```\r\n$ git grep AMPLAB_ | wc -l\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this PR we review the first batch of error classes and assign proper SQLSTATE's to them.\r\nTo this end we have compiled a grant list of SQLSTATEs used by various vendors and added them to errors/README.md\r\nWe also dedicate a subclass range that is currently unused for Spark: \"K**\"\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSQLSTATE is the API through which JDBC and ODBC based tools and applications catch and process error conditions.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, for many error classes the SQLSTATEs have been refined (moved from e.g. 42000 to a specific subclass), changed if they were in the wrong class (often between 42 (compiler) and 22 (runtime), and finally added SQLSTATE to many that had none so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRun existing pre-checkin

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nProtobuf connector related error handlers incorrectly report the exception. This is makes it hard for users to see actual issue. E.g. if there is a `FileNotFoundException` these error handlers use pass `exception.getCause()` rather than passing `exception`. As result, we lose the information that it was a `FileNotFoundException`\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n This improves error reporting. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen building a release package for PySpark and manually adding the `spark-connect_2.12-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` jar to the distribution.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix kafka test to verify lost partitions to account for slow Kafka operations\r\n\r\nBasically its possible that kafka operations around topic deletion, partition creation etc can exceed the streaming query timeout thereby failing the query and test incorrectly. This change updates the exit timeout.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChange is required to avoid test flakiness in the event of Kafka operations becoming slower\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTest only change\r\nReran the tests multiple times:\r\n```\r\n[info] Assembly jar up to date:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPresently, only foldable expressions can be passed in to schema_of_json, e.g. `SCHEMA_OF_JSON(CONCAT('', ''))`.\r\n\r\nWith this change, we accept _any_ string expression and infer the JSON schema if possible.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUsers may have a column containing JSON strings, but today they can't find the schema of each record. With this change, finding the schema of a given column is possible.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, schema_of_json will now accept string expressions which are not foldable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests were added in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nChange `CheckOverflowInTableInsert` to accept a `Cast` wrapped by an `ExpressionProxy` as a child.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis insert statement fails (in interpreted mode):\r\n```\r\ndrop table if exists tbl1;\r\ncreate table tbl1 (a int, b int) using parquet;\r\n\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.wholeStage=false;\r\nset spark.sql.codegen.factoryMode=NO_CODEGEN;\r\n\r\ninsert into tbl1\r\nselect id as a, id as b\r\nfrom range(1, 5);\r\n```\r\nIt gets the following exception:\r\n```\r\njava.lang.ClassCastException: org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.ExpressionProxy cannot be cast to org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.Cast\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CheckOverflowInTableInsert.withNewChildInternal(Cast.scala:2514)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.CheckOverflowInTableInsert.withNewChildInternal(Cast.scala:2512)\r\n```\r\nThe query produces 2 bigint values, but the table's schema expects 2 int values, so Spark wraps each output field with a `Cast`.\r\n\r\nLater, in `InterpretedUnsafeProjection`, `prepareExpressions` tries to wrap the two `Cast` expressions with an `ExpressionProxy`. However, the parent expression of each `Cast` is a `CheckOverflowInTableInsert` expression, which does not accept `ExpressionProxy` as a child.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR makes `RowEncoder` produce an `AgnosticEncoder`. The expression generation for these encoders is moved to `ScalaReflection` (this will be moved out in a subsequent PR).\r\n\r\nThe generated serializer and deserializer expressions will slightly change for both schema and type based encoders. These are not semantically different from the old expressions. Concretely the following changes have been introduced:\r\n- There is more type validation in maps/arrays/seqs for type based encoders. This should be a positive change, since it disallows users to pass wrong data through erasure hackd.\r\n- Array/Seq serialization is a bit more strict. In the old scenario it was possible to pass in sequences/arrays with the wrong type and/or nullability.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFor the Spark Connect Scala Client we also want to be able to use `Row` based results.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nThis is a refactoring, existing tests should be sufficient.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-11T20:33:53Z","updated_at":"2023-01-17T01:00:31Z","closed_at":"2023-01-16T10:04:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c549691cabb317e930e0eba3bfaedda2f3771a8b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39517/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39517/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39517/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a140e2f1651a96d8905564bed021ab128f6db0e0","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-41993","ref":"SPARK-41993","sha":"a140e2f1651a96d8905564bed021ab128f6db0e0","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41989 for in depth explanation\r\n\r\nShort summary: `pyspark/pandas/__init__.py` uses, at import time,  `logging.warning()`  which might silently call `logging.basicConfig()`.\r\nSo by importing `pyspark.pandas` (directly or indirectly) a user might unknowingly break their own logging setup (e.g. when based on  `logging.basicConfig()` or related). `logging.getLogger(...).warning()`  does not trigger this behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUser-defined logging setups will be more predictable.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual testing so far. \r\nI'm not sure it's worthwhile to cover this with a unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Connect API createDataFrame does not support create dataframe with map type.\r\nFor example, \r\n```\r\n    >>> df = spark.createDataFrame(\r\n    ...     [(1, [\"foo\", \"bar\"], {\"x\": 1.0}), (2, [], {}), (3, None, None)],\r\n    ...     (\"id\", \"an_array\", \"a_map\")\r\n    ... )\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code want create a dataframe with column 'a_map' which is map type.\r\nBut pyarrow recognize `{\"x\": 1.0}` as a struct not map.\r\npyarrow supports map with format `[('x', 1.0)]`\r\n\r\nBecause the schema of dataframe is not correct, so the other subsequent operator will be impacted.\r\nFor example:\r\n`df.select(\"id\", \"a_map\", posexplode_outer(\"an_array\")).show()`\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n```\r\n    +---+----------+----+----+\r\n    | id|     a_map| pos| col|\r\n    +---+----------+----+----+\r\n    |  1|{x -> 1.0}|   0| foo|\r\n    |  1|{x -> 1.0}|   1| bar|\r\n    |  2|        {}|null|null|\r\n    |  3|      null|null|null|\r\n    +---+----------+----+----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut got:\r\n```\r\n    +---+------+----+----+\r\n    | id| a_map| pos| col|\r\n    +---+------+----+----+\r\n    |  1| {1.0}|   0| foo|\r\n    |  1| {1.0}|   1| bar|\r\n    |  2|{null}|null|null|\r\n    |  3|  null|null|null|\r\n    +---+------+----+----+\r\n    <BLANKLINE>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet createDataFrame supports column with map type and fix some bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nManual test and doc test.\r\n","created_at":"2023-01-11T13:11:33Z","updated_at":"2023-01-13T04:50:07Z","closed_at":"2023-01-13T04:36:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3823e426be11b9783cd36e8cf4e92ae00e03ee61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/5b68f9d80833f5f0709fcc3f5040c8f9bbc95e59","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-41987","ref":"SPARK-41987","sha":"5b68f9d80833f5f0709fcc3f5040c8f9bbc95e59","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis is a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38888 .\r\n\r\nWhen I search for all the matching of `UnresolvedAttribute`, I found that there are still a few rules doing column resolution:\r\n1. ResolveAggAliasInGroupBy\r\n2. ResolveGroupByAll\r\n3. ResolveOrderByAll\r\n4. ResolveDefaultColumns\r\n\r\nThis PR merges the first 3 into `ResolvedReferences`. The last one will be done with a separate PR, as it's more complicated.\r\n\r\nTo avoid making the rule `ResolvedReferences` bigger and bigger, this PR pulls out the resolution code for `Aggregate` to a separated virtual rule (only be used by `ResolvedReferences`). The same to `Sort`. We can refactor and add more virtual rules later.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  6. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nIt's problematic to not centralize all the column resolution logic, as the execution order of the rules is not reliable. It actually leads to regression after https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/38888  : `select a from t where exists (select 1 as a group by a)`. The `group by a` should be resolved as `1 as a`, but now it's resolved as outer reference `a`. This is because `ResolveReferences` runs before `ResolveAggAliasInGroupBy`, and resolves outer references too early.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nFixes a bug, but the bug is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nnew

We can try to combine percentile functions into one and compute the result with only one Hashset.\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nSELECT max(value1) as max_value1, percentile(value2, 0.3) as p1,\r\n        percentile(value3, 0.4) + percentile(value3, 0.5) as p2,\r\n        percentile(value2, 0.6) as p3\r\nFROM t1\r\n```\r\ncan be optimized to\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT max_value1, _combined_percentile_0[0] as p1, p2, _combined_percentile_0[1] as p3\r\nFROM (\r\n   SELECT  max(value1) as max_value1,\r\n           percentile(value3, 0.4) + percentile(value3, 0.5) as p2,\r\n           percentile(value2, array(0.3, 0.6)) as _combined_percentile_0\r\n   FROM t1) as t1\r\n```\r\n\r\nBenchmark for this change:\r\n```\r\nobject CollapsePercentileBenchmark extends SqlBasedBenchmark {\r\n\r\n  override def

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to assign the proper names to the legacy error classes:\r\n\r\n- `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1105` ->  `INVALID_EXTRACT_FIELD_TYPE`\r\n- `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1106` ->  `INVALID_EXTRACT_BASE_FIELD_TYPE`\r\n- `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1209` ->  `AMBIGUOUS_REFERENCE_TO_FIELDS` \r\n\r\nChanged error messages for: \r\n- `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1106` from `Can't extract value from <child>: need struct type but got <other>.` to `\"Can't extract a value from <base>. Need a complex type [struct, array, map] but got <other>.\"`\r\n- `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1209` from `\"Ambiguous reference to fields <fields>.\"` to `\"Ambiguous reference to the field <field>. It appears <count> times in the schema.\"`\r\n- `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_1106` from `\"Field name should be String Literal, but it's <extraction>.\"` to `\"Field name should be a non-null string literal, but it's <extraction>.\"`\r\n\r\nand modify test suite to use checkError() which checks the error class name, context and etc.\r\n\r\n**Also this PR contains an additional change (AMBIGUOUS_REFERENCE_TO_FIELDS) which is not tracked in JIRA.**\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nProper name improves user experience w/ Spark SQL. fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the PR changes an user-facing error message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded additional test cases in

Attempted 638 times over 10.006178314 seconds. Last failure message: Set(301dad06-8fd7-4766-8d61-a58724d2c966, fab95baf-25ad-47dc-89fd-ff49bf1a4c4e) did not equal Set(60d3b5b0-7397-4212-8a18-ff67a17f362a, fab95baf-25ad-47dc-89fd-ff49bf1a4c4e).\r\n```\r\nThe retention queries after eviction(by the ending timestamp) are different from what is expected. I suspect that some of the input queries has the same ending timestamp.\r\nAnother proof: with RocksDB as backend, the test case always pass since writing to RocksDB takes more time.\r\n\r\nSo, I suggest adding `Thread.sleep` between the termination of these queries to fix the flakiness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes a strongly typed `SparkPath` that encapsulates a url-encoded string. It has helper methods for creating hadoop paths, uris, and uri-encoded strings.\r\nThe intent is to identify and fix various bugs in the way that Spark handles these paths. To do this we introduced the SparkPath type to `PartitionFile` (a widely used class), and then started fixing compile errors. In doing so we fixed various bugs.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nGiven `val str = \"s3://bucket/path with space/a\"` There is a difference between `new Path(str)` and `new Path(new URI(str))`, and thus a difference between `new URI(str)` and `new Path(str).toUri`.\r\nBoth `URI` and `Path` are symmetric in construction and `toString`, but are not interchangeable. Spark confuses these two paths (uri-encoded vs not). This PR attempts to use types to disambiguate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nThis PR proposes changing the public API of `PartitionedFile`, and various other methods in the name of type safety. It needs to be clear to callers of an API what type of path string is expected.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to reenable unpivot test cases, and separate negative test cases that fail with a different result. I filed a separate JIRA for that.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I also added one assert to be same as the regular PySpark side.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo make sure on the test coverage, and feature parity.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only. Adds an assert to be consistent with the regular PySpark side.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittests were factored out. CI in this PR should test this out.","created_at":"2023-01-10T09:32:04Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:52:43Z","closed_at":"2023-01-10T14:45:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e5311e07a33773c551e8a5c4d3111a0aa8564985","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e6a78aedf63585553c6bdd7a7c76cf7dc83cea4d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-41877","ref":"SPARK-41877","sha":"e6a78aedf63585553c6bdd7a7c76cf7dc83cea4d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

In the current implementation, both the node and cluster fields are not null. It breaks the assertion of the method `toSparkPlanGraphNode`:\r\n```scala\r\nclass SparkPlanGraphNodeWrapper(\r\n    val node: SparkPlanGraphNode,\r\n    val cluster: SparkPlanGraphClusterWrapper) {\r\n\r\n  def toSparkPlanGraphNode(): SparkPlanGraphNode = {\r\n    assert(node == null ^ cluster == null, \"Exactly one of node, cluster values to be set.\")\r\n    if (node != null) node else cluster.toSparkPlanGraphCluster()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis PR is to fix the bug by using `oneof` in the protobuf definition of `SparkPlanGraphNodeWrapper`\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe pr aims to fix NPE for error classes: CANNOT_PARSE_JSON_FIELD.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. When I want to delete redundant 'toString()' in code block as follow\r\n<img width=\"722\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15246973/211269145-0f087bb1-dc93-480c-9f9d-afde5ac1c8de.png\">\r\nI found the UT(\"select from_json('[1, \\\"2\\\", 3]', 'array<int>')\") failed.\r\n\r\n#### Why can it succeed before deletion?\r\n\r\n`parse.getCurrentName.toString()` => null.toString() => throw NPE, but follow logical can cover it,\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/15a0f55246bee7b043bd6081f53744fbf74403eb/sql/catalyst/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/catalyst/json/JacksonParser.scala#L569-L573\r\nBut obviously this is not our original intention.\r\n\r\n#### After deletion, The IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.\r\n`parse.getCurrentName` => throw java.lang.IllegalArgumentException as follow:\r\n`Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot resolve variable 'fieldName' (enableSubstitutionInVariables=false).\r\n\tat org.apache.commons.text.StringSubstitutor.substitute(StringSubstitutor.java:1532)\r\n\tat org.apache.commons.text.StringSubstitutor.substitute(StringSubstitutor.java:1389)\r\n\tat org.apache.commons.text.StringSubstitutor.replace(StringSubstitutor.java:893)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.ErrorClassesJsonReader.getErrorMessage(ErrorClassesJSONReader.scala:51)\r\n\t... 140 more\r\n`\r\nAbove code can't handle IllegalArgumentException, so the UT failed.\r\n\r\nSo, we should consider the case where `parse.getCurrentName` is null.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\nExisted

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR mainly proposes to pass the user-specified configurations to local remote mode.\r\n\r\nPreviously, all user-specific configurations were ignored in case of PySpark shell such as`./bin/pyspark` or plain Python interpreter - PySpark application submission case was fine.\r\n\r\nNow, configurations are properly passed to the server side, e.g., `./bin/pyspark --remote local --conf aaa=bbb` and `aaa=bbb` is properly passed to the server side.\r\n\r\nFor `spark.master` and `spark.plugins`, user-specific configurations are respected. If they are unset, they are automatically set, e.g., `org.apache.spark.sql.connect.SparkConnectPlugin`. If they are set, users have to provide the proper values to overwrite them, meaning that either:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark --remote local --conf spark.plugins=\"other.Plugin,org.apache.spark.sql.connect.SparkConnectPlugin\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark --remote local\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR fixes the related code as below:\r\n- Adds `spark.local.connect` internal configuration to be used in Spark Submit (so we don't have to parse and manipulate user specified arguments in Python in order to remove `--remote` or `spark.remote` configuration).\r\n- Adds some more validation on arguments in `SparkSubmitCommandBuilder` so invalid combination can fail fast (e.g., setting both remote and master like `--master ...` and `--conf spark.remote=...`)\r\n- In dev mode, do not set `spark.jars` anymore since it adds the jars into the class path of the JVM through `addJarToCurrentClassLoader`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo correctly pass the configurations specified from users.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, Spark Connect has not been released yet.\r\nThis is kind of a followup of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/39441 to complete its support.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested all combinations such as:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.remote=local\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.remote=local --conf spark.jars=a\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.remote=local --jars /.../spark/connector/connect/server/target/scala-2.12/spark-connect-assembly-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n./bin/spark-submit --conf spark.remote=local --jars /.../spark/connector/connect/server/target/scala-2.12/spark-connect-assembly-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.py\r\n./bin/pyspark --conf spark.remote=local --conf spark.jars=/.../spark/connector/connect/server/target/scala-2.12/spark-connect-assembly-3.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\r\n./bin/pyspark --master \"local[*]\" --remote \"local\"\r\n./bin/spark-submit --conf spark.remote=local app.py\r\n./bin/spark-submit --master=\"local[*]\" --conf spark.remote=local app.py\r\n./bin/spark-submit --master=\"local[*]\" --remote=local app.py\r\n./bin/pyspark --master \"local[*]\" --remote \"local\"\r\n./bin/pyspark --master \"local[*]\" --remote \"local\"\r\n./bin/pyspark --master \"local[*]\" --conf spark.remote=\"local\"\r\n./bin/spark-submit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs described in [SPARK-41497](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41497), when a task with rdd cache failed after caching the block data successfully, the retry task will load from the cache. While since the first task attempt failed, so the registered accumulators won't get updated.\r\n\r\nThe general idea to fix the issue in this PR is to add a visibility status for RDDBlocks, a RDDBlock will be visible only when one of the tasks generating the RDDBlock succeed to guarantee that accumulators have been updated.\r\nMaking below changes to do this:\r\n1. In `BlockManagerMasterEndpoint`, adding `visibleRDDBlocks` to help record the RDDBlocks which are visible, and `tidToRddBlockIds` to help to track the RDDBlocks generated in each taskId so that we can update the visibility status based on task status;\r\n2. In `BlockInfoManager`, adding `visibleRDDBlocks` to track the visible RDDBlocks in the block manager, once a RDDBlock is visible, master will ask BlockManagers having the block to update the visibility status;\r\n3. When do `RDD` getOrCompute, re-compute the partition to update accumulators if the cached RDDBlock is not visible event if the cached data exists, and report the taskId and RDDBlock relationship to `BlockManagerMasterEndpoint`;\r\n4. When a task finished successfully, ask `BlockManagerMasterEndpoint` to update the blocks to be visible, and broadcast the visibility status to `BlockManagers` having the cached data.\r\n\r\n### Why

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nInfer IsNotNull constraints for complex join expressions along with IsNotNull constraints for the attribute.\r\nFor example,\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE t(id int, text string) using parquet;\r\n\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM t as t1\r\nLEFT JOIN t as t2\r\nON t1.text = get_json_object(t2.text, '$.not_exists_col');\r\n```\r\nBefore this PR\r\n```\r\nJoin LeftOuter, (text#282 = get_json_object(text#284, $.not_exists_col))\r\n:- Relation default.t[id#281L,text#282] parquet\r\n+- Relation default.t[id#283L,text#284] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR\r\n```\r\nJoin LeftOuter, (text#282 = get_json_object(text#284, $.not_exists_col))\r\n:- Relation default.t[id#281L,text#282] parquet\r\n+- Filter isnotnull(get_json_object(text#284, $.not_exists_col))\r\n   +- Relation default.t[id#283L,text#284] parquet\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor the rows which the result of complex join expression is null will cause data skew, and will be filtered out until the join.\r\nThat would be very slow.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. Added the base R `all` function (or `any`, as appropriate) while doing the check of whether `class(.)` is `Column` or not; e.g., `if(all(class(.) == \"Column\"))`, or `if(inherits(., \"Column\"))` is proposed instead of the current approach `if(class(.) == \"Column\")`.\r\n2. Also added relevant SparkR test cases to verify no warning or error is resulted on the updated functions.\r\n3. Only R scripts have been modified.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nBase R 4.2.0 introduced a change ([[Rd] R 4.2.0 is released](https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-announce/2022/000683.html)), \"Calling if() or while() with a condition of length greater than one gives an error rather than a warning.\"\r\n\r\nThe below code is a reproducible example of the issue. If it is executed in R >=4.2.0 then it will generate an error, or else just a warning message. `Sys.time()` is a multi-class object in R, and throughout the Spark R repository 'if' statement is used as: `if(class == \"Column\")` - this causes error in the latest R version >= 4.2.0. Note that R allows an object to have multiple 'class' names as a character vector ([R: Object Classes](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/class.html)); hence this type of check itself was not a good idea in the first place.\r\n\r\n{\r\n SparkR::sparkR.session()\r\n t <- Sys.time()\r\n sdf <- SparkR::createDataFrame(data.frame(x = t + c(-1, 1, -1, 1, -1)))\r\n SparkR::collect(SparkR::filter(sdf, SparkR::column('x') > t))\r\n}\r\n#> Warning in if (class(e2) == 'Column') {: the condition has length > 1 \r\n#> and only the first element will be used\r\n#> x\r\n#> 1 2023-01-07 20:40:20\r\n#> 2 2023-01-07 20:40:20 \r\n\r\n{\r\n Sys.setenv(`_R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION_` = \"true\")\r\n SparkR::sparkR.session()\r\n t <- Sys.time()\r\n sdf <- SparkR::createDataFrame(data.frame(x = t + c(-1, 1, -1, 1, -1)))\r\n SparkR::collect(SparkR::filter(sdf, SparkR::column('x') > t))\r\n}\r\n#> Error in h(simpleError(msg, call)): error in evaluating the argument 'x' \r\n#> in selecting a method for function 'collect': error in evaluating the \r\n#> argument 'condition' in selecting a method for function 'filter': the\r\n#> condition has length > 1 \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded multiple relevant SparkR unit test cases to verify the fix; the Jira ticket number is added in the new test_that block.\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why
