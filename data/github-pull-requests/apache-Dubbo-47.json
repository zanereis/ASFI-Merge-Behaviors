your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-29T04:07:32Z","updated_at":"2021-10-23T04:50:07Z","closed_at":"2021-01-29T06:24:40Z","merged_at":"2021-01-29T06:24:40Z","merge_commit_sha":"25761bb51b7c3a8702690bca821aa1658bcca0d7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7152/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7152/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7152/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4d876e3612f1af3da75b9c8fe9614394e1b24c6c","head":{"label":"kylixs:fix-zk-depends","ref":"fix-zk-depends","sha":"4d876e3612f1af3da75b9c8fe9614394e1b24c6c","user":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305677990,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU2Nzc5OTA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"kylixs/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"kylixs","id":5483385,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0ODMzODU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5483385?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs","html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kylixs/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/kylixs/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-28T16:04:17Z","updated_at":"2021-01-28T16:06:52Z","closed_at":"2021-01-28T16:06:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7149/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7149/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7149/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/41edf2ac84fc51cca02055e7d09f6d4981531a39","head":{"label":"huibinliupush:learn","ref":"learn","sha":"41edf2ac84fc51cca02055e7d09f6d4981531a39","user":{"login":"huibinliupush","id":5794695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTQ2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5794695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush","html_url":"https://github.com/huibinliupush","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":333726280,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzM3MjYyODA=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"huibinliupush/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"huibinliupush","id":5794695,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3OTQ2OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5794695?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush","html_url":"https://github.com/huibinliupush","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/huibinliupush/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/huibinliupush/dubbo","description":"Apache

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

Brief changelog\r\n\r\nfind beans by name, not by type,  to solve this issue: https://github.com/alibaba/spring-context-support/issues/20 , and  without affecting the spring dependency injection initialization function.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nrun  tests of `dubbo-samples-zipkin`  in  repo `apache/dubbo-samples`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-26T08:54:00Z","updated_at":"2021-01-27T15:53:00Z","closed_at":"2021-01-27T15:52:55Z","merged_at":"2021-01-27T15:52:55Z","merge_commit_sha":"02f236e96dc34cdd715e75c837b881a9c09c48a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7135/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7135/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7135/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/238fd8c7df588af8e3a118fad96f5e004723ce8b","head":{"label":"AlbumenJ:actions/add_springboot_build","ref":"actions/add_springboot_build","sha":"238fd8c7df588af8e3a118fad96f5e004723ce8b","user":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":211282785,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTEyODI3ODU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"AlbumenJ/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ/dubbo","description":"Apache

tests under `dubbo-samples/dubbo-samples-metadata-report/dubbo-samples-metadata-report-local-xml`\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove error message of create extension failure, avoid a large number of unrelated extension loading failure errors \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nDisplay related error message by name when create extension is failed.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo extraneous errors are displayed when loading a non-existent extension.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

interrupted.\r\n2. add a unit test in DefaultFutureTest.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nLink to issue: #7100 .\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-21T13:38:08Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T03:34:45Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T07:31:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5c5aaaa404d41b75e9b1be29a3d93f0652c351a8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AlbumenJ","id":9292748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjkyOTI3NDg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9292748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ","html_url":"https://github.com/AlbumenJ","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AlbumenJ/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n这是在 #7109  基础上进一步将消费者端Executor调整为“全局共享”、“按提供者隔离”2个可选模式，默认工作在全局共享，可以通过dubbo:consumer的share.threadpool进行设置。\r\n```\r\n<dubbo:consumer>\r\n    <dubbo:parameter key=\"share.threadpool\" value=\"false\"/>\r\n</dubbo:consumer>\r\n```\r\n\r\n备注：share.threadpool参数命名沿用自2.6.9\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. 如果share.threadpool=true，DefaultExecutorRepository在createExecutor时返回包装后的ShareableExecutor。\r\n2. AbstractClient在close时，如果executor为ShareableExecutor这不处理executor.shutdown。\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-21T10:37:54Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T06:39:44Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T06:39:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d114fc1163127ad3182516fe56ecf52a928d7438","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7120/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7120/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7120/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/cf3d3b7905477f0794270c68943aef36280ce473","head":{"label":"zhangyz-hd:fix_7054_again_more","ref":"fix_7054_again_more","sha":"cf3d3b7905477f0794270c68943aef36280ce473","user":{"login":"zhangyz-hd","id":10389889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzg5ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10389889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyz-hd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"b429763f4d651c7f82b2fad7dd58713ea774cc54","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n目前社区版本消费者端的executor线程池是按提供者的Port的做了共享，当一个提供者下线时，AbstractClient就会将executor销毁，造成后续处理ChannelState.DISCONNECTED事件，以及消费者再调用其他提供者时无可用的executor，就会重新在创建一个executor，这个模式会导致#7054 所描述的问题。\r\n同时考虑到消费者维护N个executor的开销，因此将消费者端的executor改为全局1个，在节点shutdown时再销毁。\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1，DefaultExecutorRepository分配executor时，消费者的key使用Integer.MAX_VALUE，保证消费者使用1个executor，提供者保持原装（按协议的port分配executor）；同时getExecutor()内不再createExecutor，当executor为null则直接降级返回SHARED_EXECUTOR；\r\n2，AbstractClient在close0时不关闭其持有的executor；\r\n3，DubboBootstrap.destroy()时销毁ExecutorRepository；\r\n\r\nFollow

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-18T02:40:28Z","updated_at":"2021-07-05T02:22:38Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T15:56:11Z","merged_at":"2021-02-22T15:56:11Z","merge_commit_sha":"2dadaf8018ab531fb199c681b1053e07cd94f8f9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7109/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7109/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7109/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6d059f327c27684b62b7435c7fce39fbfe7cc17d","head":{"label":"zhangyz-hd:fix_7054_again","ref":"fix_7054_again","sha":"6d059f327c27684b62b7435c7fce39fbfe7cc17d","user":{"login":"zhangyz-hd","id":10389889,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMzg5ODg5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10389889?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd","html_url":"https://github.com/zhangyz-hd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhangyz-hd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"594a68fd718fb101ef489bf4999a0536d61f08c8","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe test `org.apache.dubbo.config.ServiceConfigTest.testProxy` is not idempotent and fails if run twice in the same JVM, because each of the tests pollutes state shared among tests. It may be good to clean this state pollution so that some other tests do not fail in the future due to the shared state polluted by these tests.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nReset `TestProxyFactory.count` to 0 at the end of `ServiceConfigTest.testProxy()`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nWith the proposed fix, the test does not pollute the shared state (and passes when run twice in the same JVM).\r\n\r\nLink to issue:

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-11T03:46:07Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T08:43:38Z","closed_at":"2021-01-15T08:43:37Z","merged_at":"2021-01-15T08:43:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"594a68fd718fb101ef489bf4999a0536d61f08c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7094/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7094/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7094/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/5f6cd17da2a067c7150214e7b1f98b38249c448c","head":{"label":"xuekg:local_master_xuekg","ref":"local_master_xuekg","sha":"5f6cd17da2a067c7150214e7b1f98b38249c448c","user":{"login":"xuekg","id":41315676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzE1Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41315676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg","html_url":"https://github.com/xuekg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":328518655,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg1MTg2NTU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"xuekg/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xuekg","id":41315676,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQxMzE1Njc2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41315676?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg","html_url":"https://github.com/xuekg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xuekg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xuekg/dubbo","description":"Apache

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-06T08:49:57Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T08:14:43Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T08:14:43Z","merged_at":"2021-02-22T08:14:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"1d9619da1c04f28117b78802d47d01bb897fdcf5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/6ac15e9de526305408c6818949c2a535794e28e6","head":{"label":"thisiswanghy:patch-2","ref":"patch-2","sha":"6ac15e9de526305408c6818949c2a535794e28e6","user":{"login":"thisiswanghy","id":20765679,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwNzY1Njc5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20765679?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy","html_url":"https://github.com/thisiswanghy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/thisiswanghy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"70b6fb357c2a4a5aa0f593af588e9e4abd2ec05e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4710920,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEwOTIw","name":"dubbo","full_name":"apache/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/dubbo","description":"The java implementation of Apache Dubbo.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n提供者和消费者之间的心跳，Request和Response的Data都为null：\r\n\r\n```\r\n//org.apache.dubbo.remoting.exchange.support.header.HeartbeatTimerTask#doTask\r\nRequest req = new Request();\r\nreq.setVersion(Version.getProtocolVersion());\r\nreq.setTwoWay(true);\r\nreq.setEvent(HEARTBEAT_EVENT);//HEARTBEAT_EVENT = null\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n//org.apache.dubbo.remoting.exchange.support.header.HeartbeatHandler#received\r\nResponse res = new Response(req.getId(), req.getVersion());\r\nres.setEvent(HEARTBEAT_EVENT);//HEARTBEAT_EVENT = null\r\n```\r\n\r\n当提供者和消费者数量非常大时，每个节点都需要发送/接受大量的心跳Requet和Response，这些Requet、Response也会和服务调用一样经过serialize+encode、decode+deserialize，而其中的serialize/deserialize需要消耗过多的CPU资源。\r\n这个优化的目的是对于心跳Requet/Response跳过serialize/deserialize处理，serialize改为赋值为null对象的序列化后字节，deserialize改为直接赋值null。\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n在CodecSupport中增加getNullBytesOf(Serialization s)方法，首次访问时根据serialization获得null对象的字节数组并缓存到ID_NULLBYTES_MAP\r\nDubboCodec、ExchangeCodec中在调整encodeRequest、encodeResponse、decodeBody逻辑，实现上述目标。\r\n\r\n备注：目前DUBBO的Serialization的实现中，以下三个实现其实尚不支持null对象的序列化，在CodecSupport.getNullBytesOf中降级为返回空字符串。\r\n\r\n1.

GenericProtobufJsonSerialization\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTo support default value in ConfigUtils\r\n\r\n#7068\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-04T08:50:01Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T05:11:52Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T05:11:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0440ea9ad9c85b3ef1ec20b87503df14b72a732a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7073/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7073/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7073/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e62f961b19d8b04c3a5e1314f57703f83e639379","head":{"label":"dkisser:2.7.x","ref":"2.7.x","sha":"e62f961b19d8b04c3a5e1314f57703f83e639379","user":{"login":"dkisser","id":24600271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjAwMjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24600271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser","html_url":"https://github.com/dkisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222401661,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI0MDE2NjE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"dkisser/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dkisser","id":24600271,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NjAwMjcx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24600271?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser","html_url":"https://github.com/dkisser","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dkisser/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dkisser/dubbo","description":"Apache

contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-31T08:52:20Z","updated_at":"2021-01-04T06:43:26Z","closed_at":"2021-01-04T06:43:25Z","merged_at":"2021-01-04T06:43:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"70b6fb357c2a4a5aa0f593af588e9e4abd2ec05e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7070/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7070/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7070/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/bdb417326766ab776b410cf77e728cb9f28e997f","head":{"label":"github-ganyu:master","ref":"master","sha":"bdb417326766ab776b410cf77e728cb9f28e997f","user":{"login":"github-ganyu","id":25056767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDU2NzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25056767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu","html_url":"https://github.com/github-ganyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":102852535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDI4NTI1MzU=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"github-ganyu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"github-ganyu","id":25056767,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MDU2NzY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25056767?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu","html_url":"https://github.com/github-ganyu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/github-ganyu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/github-ganyu/dubbo","description":":loudspeaker:

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-22T06:08:29Z","updated_at":"2021-03-14T14:26:44Z","closed_at":"2021-03-14T14:26:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"127bf67fb1d0b9f91266a93bbda63c56175ac2ee","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7045/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7045/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7045/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/ed88219c0a2ef10e437d6efe0129c496dd3c91b9","head":{"label":"panxiaojun233:feature/state-router-base3.0","ref":"feature/state-router-base3.0","sha":"ed88219c0a2ef10e437d6efe0129c496dd3c91b9","user":{"login":"panxiaojun233","id":43985911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTg1OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43985911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233","html_url":"https://github.com/panxiaojun233","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":292961759,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTI5NjE3NTk=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"panxiaojun233/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"panxiaojun233","id":43985911,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzOTg1OTEx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43985911?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233","html_url":"https://github.com/panxiaojun233","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/panxiaojun233/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/panxiaojun233/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n现象：\r\n当 provider 意外宕机时（例如，kill -9 ），会触发 `org.apache.dubbo.common.threadpool.manager.DefaultExecutorRepository#getExecutor`。\r\n由于 `executor` 先被关闭认为没有可用的线程池，重新使用默认的 `fixed` 线程池创建。多次触发后，会导致进程使用的线程过多。\r\n\r\n原因：\r\n1. executor

easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-22T06:07:16Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T14:48:53Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T14:48:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c93ea55bfd98538c6c538847ac8080248503ce62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7044/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7044/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7044/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/032541179bfc831ba02c6100eb24e7b9c9d0e29c","head":{"label":"stonelion:master","ref":"master","sha":"032541179bfc831ba02c6100eb24e7b9c9d0e29c","user":{"login":"stonelion","id":5867317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjczMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5867317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion","html_url":"https://github.com/stonelion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":323526753,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjM1MjY3NTM=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"stonelion/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"stonelion","id":5867317,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NjczMTc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5867317?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion","html_url":"https://github.com/stonelion","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stonelion/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/stonelion/dubbo","description":"Apache

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-16T06:33:03Z","updated_at":"2020-12-21T04:56:22Z","closed_at":"2020-12-21T04:56:22Z","merged_at":"2020-12-21T04:56:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"c48dc6a0af6b25b96673afd5248692c16cfc273a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7331964,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MzMxOTY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"C5DEF5","default":false,"description":"Bugs

before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nupdate dubbo3.0, make service_name compatible with dubbo2.0\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nupdate dubbo3.0, make service_name compatible with dubbo2.0\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nfor example, we have two projects:\r\nproject A is a provider, using dubbo2.0, nacos registry info is \"providers:com.test.TestService:staging\".\r\nproject B is a consumer, using dubbo2.0, nacos registry info is \"consumers:com.test.TestService:staging\".\r\nnow, project A changes its dubbo-version to 3.0, and its nacos registry info changes too, becoming \"providers:com.test.TestService::staging\". project B cannot finds providers anymore.\r\n\r\nthis is a simple example, the actual situation is more complicated\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-10T07:33:03Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T16:05:38Z","closed_at":"2021-02-22T16:05:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"102f919631312bc4e23693d5f5a0cdb4b762c7dc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/7011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/7011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/e5773e9f3dc107c038a69af56ea9d8ac91c38bfb","head":{"label":"IiiinSea:3.0-fix-service-name","ref":"3.0-fix-service-name","sha":"e5773e9f3dc107c038a69af56ea9d8ac91c38bfb","user":{"login":"IiiinSea","id":18481657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgxNjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18481657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea","html_url":"https://github.com/IiiinSea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":320187361,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjAxODczNjE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"IiiinSea/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"IiiinSea","id":18481657,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NDgxNjU3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18481657?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea","html_url":"https://github.com/IiiinSea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/IiiinSea/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/IiiinSea/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nRemove timestamp from key to prevent the creation of multiple registries\r\n每次调用getRegistry 都会创建新的Registry.造成会生成大量的HostReactor(里边又有serviceInfoMap),造成内存泄露.\r\n问题的原因是没有删除时间戳(dubbo2 生成的key,不会包含时间戳).\r\n正常使用不会有问题,但是会随着时间的发展oom\r\n\r\nNacosRegistryFactory 中的 createRegistryCacheKey 获取的是 toFullString ,因此也不可能过滤(但也可以修改这里)\r\n\r\n我们这里修改时间戳,是认为这算一个比较公共的属性 \r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

This PR fixes the subset of those links  related to dubbo-samples repo being restructured when Golang was removed.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nLinks to the dubbo-samples repo were updated to reflect the new folder structure.\r\nDirections to cd into the repo were also updated.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThe new links were verified to work.\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T05:15:47Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T14:16:53Z","closed_at":"2021-02-23T14:16:52Z","merged_at":"2021-02-23T14:16:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"c47eb131ecd7c570017cbeb62724734120d0e361","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/4044a3bb3ddeb85157d2528d7c7fe0d7872f5211","head":{"label":"BethMyre:master","ref":"master","sha":"4044a3bb3ddeb85157d2528d7c7fe0d7872f5211","user":{"login":"BethMyre","id":36686339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Njg2MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36686339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre","html_url":"https://github.com/BethMyre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":319522004,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTk1MjIwMDQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"BethMyre/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"BethMyre","id":36686339,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2Njg2MzM5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/36686339?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre","html_url":"https://github.com/BethMyre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BethMyre/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/BethMyre/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe test `org.apache.dubbo.rpc.RpcContextTest.testObject` is not idempotent and fails if run twice in the same JVM, because it pollutes state shared among tests. It may be good to clean this state pollution so that some other tests do not fail in the future due to the shared state polluted by this test. (See [PR #6314](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/pull/6314) for an example of how this could cause issues)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nIn `RpcContextTest.testObject()`, call

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe test `org.apache.dubbo.rpc.filter.AccessLogFilterTest.testInvokeException` is not idempotent and fails if run twice in the same JVM, because it pollutes state shared among tests. It may be good to clean this state pollution so that some other tests do not fail in the future due to the shared state polluted by this test.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nIn `AccessLogFilterTest.testInvokeException()`, call `DubboAppender.clear()` to clear all the logs from the log list when the test finishes.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nWith the proposed fix, the test does not pollute the shared state (and passes when run twice in the same JVM).\r\n\r\nThis change fixes

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-06T12:59:29Z","updated_at":"2020-12-06T13:48:16Z","closed_at":"2020-12-06T13:48:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b62ea6ef5b51e4d23c585d968fc83553ef2dc120","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6989/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6989/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6989/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/a905e0eb1a8a2369f111bc22d5205fb58a5d118b","head":{"label":"minute5:dubbo_create_nacos_multiple_identical_namespace","ref":"dubbo_create_nacos_multiple_identical_namespace","sha":"a905e0eb1a8a2369f111bc22d5205fb58a5d118b","user":{"login":"minute5","id":47876584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODc2NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47876584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5","html_url":"https://github.com/minute5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":318959451,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTg5NTk0NTE=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"minute5/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"minute5","id":47876584,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3ODc2NTg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47876584?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5","html_url":"https://github.com/minute5","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minute5/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/minute5/dubbo","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nOptimize the MockInvokersSelector\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1. Remove the unused import\r\n2. Use CollectionUtils#isEmptyMap to check invocation's attachments\r\n3. Remove the unused MockInvokersSelector#hasMockProviders to improve the performance\r\n4. Add MockInvokersSelector#isMockProtocol to check if the given invoker is mock protocol\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-06T12:25:26Z","updated_at":"2021-04-12T09:30:24Z","closed_at":"2021-04-12T09:30:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"28d16b291df0ccb58fbeab58471bde0a8ae84583","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chickenlj","id":18097545,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4MDk3NTQ1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18097545?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj","html_url":"https://github.com/chickenlj","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chickenlj/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n使用docker部署的dubbo微服务.但当想nacos注册的时候,会使用本地docker分配的ip(网桥或者host模式).通过env,在注册阶段替换.通过此修改,即可在docker中使用dubbo微服务.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-03T08:24:51Z","updated_at":"2021-03-04T09:25:49Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T09:25:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2b96679e8206b98bdd45823b28b924c60c0be306","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe test `org.apache.dubbo.common.bytecode.WrapperTest#test_getMethodNames_ContainExtendsParentMethods` can fail due to a different iteration order of ConcurrentHashMap. The failures are as follows:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] test_getMethodNames_ContainExtendsParentMethods  Time elapsed: 0.03 s  <<< FAILURE!                                                                                 \r\norg.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: array contents differ at index [0], expected: <hello> but was: <world>                                                                     at org.apache.dubbo.common.bytecode.WrapperTest.test_getMethodNames_ContainExtendsParentMethods(WrapperTest.java:125)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fix is to change it to a ConcurrentLinkedHashMap([ref](https://github.com/ben-manes/concurrentlinkedhashmap)) so that the iteration order remains stable and the failure will not occur any more. In this way, the test will be more stable.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nuse ConcurrentLinkedHashMap instead of ConcurrentHashMap\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-02T22:23:47Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:41:18Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:41:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"890244802d12f9b3f62cff66ee3daa13ab816dac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

#6567 里面提到了这个问题，刚好也碰到了，修复一下。\r\n\r\n具体触发条件为：\r\n1. 启动一个普通consumer和一个provider，consumer可以正常调用。\r\n2. 关闭provider进程，观察注册中心，一直等到provider注册的url消失。\r\n3. 重启provider进程，consumer再次调用，报\"safe guard client , should not be called ,must have a bug.\"并且之后每5000次调用会触发一次。\r\n\r\n这个问题的根源是LazyConnectExchangeClient在两种情况下被使用，这两种情况需要表现的行为不一样，但是代码一样导致。\r\n这两种情况一个是consumer主动设置为延迟连接，一个是consumer和provider断开连接时进行防御式编程，如果在连接关闭后还有请求过来就用这个延迟初始化的client处理一下。\r\n\r\n具体到上面的这个例子：\r\n第一步consumer正常调用时，DubboProtocol里面referenceClientMap字段保存了consumer连接provider的ReferenceCountExchangeClient。\r\n第二步关闭provider进程一直到provider注册url消失时，referenceClientMap字段里面的引用还在，但是ReferenceCountExchangeClient的replaceWithLazyClient方法被调用，内部的ExchangeClient换成了LazyConnectExchangeClient。\r\n第三步provider进程重启，consumer再次调用时，会重新获取到这个已经关闭的ReferenceCountExchangeClient。判断代码为\r\n````\r\nreferenceCountExchangeClient == null || referenceCountExchangeClient.isClosed()\r\n````\r\n而referenceCountExchangeClient.isClosed()会调用到LazyConnectExchangeClient的isClosed方法\r\n````\r\nif (client != null) {\r\n    return client.isClosed();\r\n} else {\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n````\r\n此时还没有延迟初始化，会直接返回false，导致后续的调用都会使用这个client，每5000报告一次warning。\r\n\r\n这个bug应该是在 #5532 这个pr被合并后触发，原本LazyConnectExchangeClient在没有client时isClosed()方法会返回true，会在上面例子第三步时给清理掉。而在没有client时，isClosed()方法返回false，应该是针对consumer主动设置为延迟连接的情况；而consumer和provider断开连接时建立的那个LazyConnectExchangeClient的isClosed()方法应该始终返回true。\r\n\r\n具体修复方式为模仿replaceWithLazyClient方法里的方式，在场景不同时添加参数。\r\n通过增加一个LAZY_CLOSE_STATE_KEY，强制设置isClosed方法修改的返回值，isClosed()方法内容改为\r\n````\r\n        if (closeState != null) {\r\n            return closeState;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (client == null) {\r\n            return false;\r\n        } else {\r\n            return client.isClosed();\r\n

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe test `org.apache.dubbo.rpc.filter.AccessLogFilterTest.testInvokeException` is not idempotent and fails if run twice in the same JVM, because it pollutes state shared among tests. It may be good to clean this state pollution so that some other tests do not fail in the future due to the shared state polluted by this test.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nIn `AccessLogFilterTest.testInvokeException()`, call `DubboAppender.clear()` to clear all the logs from the log list when the test finishes.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nWith the proposed fix, the test does not pollute the shared state (and passes when run twice in the same

change\r\n\r\nXXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe tests are not idempotent and fails if run twice in the same JVM, because each of the tests pollutes state shared among tests:\r\n* `dubbo-common,org.apache.dubbo.common.extension.ExtensionLoaderTest.test_replaceExtension_Adaptive`\r\n* `dubbo-common,org.apache.dubbo.common.extension.ExtensionLoaderTest.test_AddExtension`\r\n* `dubbo-common,org.apache.dubbo.common.extension.ExtensionLoaderTest.test_replaceExtension`\r\n\r\nIt may be good to clean this state pollution so that some other tests do not fail in the future due to the shared state polluted by these tests.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nCall `ExtensionLoader.resetExtensionLoader()` to reset the ExtensionLoader for the certain extension types used in each tests in `test_replaceExtension_Adaptive`, `test_AddExtension`, and `test_replaceExtension`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nWith the proposed fix, the test does not pollute the shared state (and passes when run twice in the same JVM).\r\n\r\nLink to issue:

browser\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist.

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue.

What is the purpose of the change\r\nThe test `dubbo-common,org.apache.dubbo.common.threadlocal.InternalThreadLocalTest.testSize` is not idempotent and fails if run twice in the same JVM, because it pollutes state shared among tests. It may be good to clean this state pollution so that some other tests do not fail in the future due to the shared state polluted by this test.\r\n\r\nIssue link: [Dubbo-6935](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues/6935)\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nIn `InternalThreadLocalTest.testSize()`, call `InternalThreadLocal.removeAll()` to clear all the thread local variables stored in the test run.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\nWith the proposed fix, the test does not pollute the shared state (and passes when run twice in the same JVM).\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install

quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-20T09:15:32Z","updated_at":"2020-11-20T09:16:10Z","closed_at":"2020-11-20T09:16:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5d90aee8f577d4aecfe0ce9b9ac6132700145c04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6933/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/6933/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/issues/6933/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/statuses/0a27d3ec2ce30b205d39315030b3106e90c4cd8a","head":{"label":"shushuiu:master","ref":"master","sha":"0a27d3ec2ce30b205d39315030b3106e90c4cd8a","user":{"login":"shushuiu","id":26620219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjIwMjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26620219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu","html_url":"https://github.com/shushuiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":242690184,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDI2OTAxODQ=","name":"dubbo","full_name":"shushuiu/dubbo","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shushuiu","id":26620219,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjIwMjE5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/26620219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu","html_url":"https://github.com/shushuiu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shushuiu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shushuiu/dubbo","description":"Apache

your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation

us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GITHUB_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a GITHUB issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue.\r\n- [ ] Format the pull request title like `[Dubbo-XXX] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist #XXX`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [ ] Run `mvn clean install -DskipTests=false` & `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test` to make sure unit-test and integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please follow the [Software Donation Guide](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/wiki/Software-donation-guide).\r\n","created_at":"2020-11-20T02:39:33Z","updated_at":"2021-05-22T07:42:09Z","closed_at":"2021-05-22T07:42:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"53ce7610b7207624e68044a814a7bd51fe0bb729","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":699741254,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTk3NDEyNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/dubbo/labels/status/waiting-for-feedback","name":"status/waiting-for-feedback","color":"C2E0C6","default":false,"description":"Need
