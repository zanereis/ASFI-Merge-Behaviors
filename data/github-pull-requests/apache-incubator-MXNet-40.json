when we use `module.fit()`, we can pass a str or an Optimizer object as the [optimizer](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/module/base_module.py#L440). When we pass an Optimizer object that is created outside before calling `module.fit()`, we are not checking and setting `optimizer.idx2name` which is used to mask out entries in update for weight decay in [module.init_optimizer](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/module/module.py#L522) method. If `idx2name` is not set when creating the optimizer object outside, it can impact the convergence behavior as weight decay is applied to all parameters in this case.\r\n\r\nThis PR checks if `idx2name` is set if an Optimizer object is given. If not, we are setting it to the proper values. Fixes #9511 as @wkcn pointed out.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-15T19:16:21Z","updated_at":"2019-04-19T15:33:28Z","closed_at":"2019-04-19T06:04:46Z","merged_at":"2019-04-19T06:04:46Z","merge_commit_sha":"391a1be260eb75b437ebced6743647b8e9df7802","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis is a PoC for https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14584\r\nprereq is the AMP PR: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14173\r\nI have pulled some of the operator code for amp_cast and amp_multicast etc. into my branch for now.\r\n\r\n### Approach ###\r\n\r\n- Currently, the pass uses the fp16_op_names, fp32_op_names and widest_op_names to make decisions on operators to insert in the computation graph.\r\n- The logic for casting currently follows the PR: #14173.\r\n- For fp16_ops an amp_cast with target_dtype of fp16 is inserted before the op, fp32 is inserted before op for fp32 ops,  for widest_type_casts, amp_multicast is used.\r\n- The code is currently specific to fp16 and fp32 ops but i plan to change it to use target_dtype, low_precision_ops, full_precision_ops.\r\n\r\n### Testing ###\r\n\r\nTest script for the PoC:\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\n\r\ndata = mx.sym.var(\"data\")\r\ndata2 = mx.sym.var(\"data2\")\r\ndata3 = mx.sym.var(\"data3\")\r\nx = mx.sym.exp(data)\r\nx2 = mx.sym.sin(data)\r\nx3 = mx.sym.cos(data)\r\nsym = x + x2 + x3\r\nresult = mx.sym.add_n(sym, data2, data3)\r\nx = mx.viz.plot_network(result)\r\ncasted_result = mx.contrib.amp._convert_symbol(result, fp32_op_names=[\"elemwise_add\"], fp16_op_names=[\"sin\", \"cos\", \"exp\"], widest_type_op_names=[\"add_n\"])\r\ny = mx.viz.plot_network(casted_result)\r\nx.render('test-output/round-table.gv', view=False)\r\ny.render('test-output/round-table.gv', view=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nModel before:\r\n\r\n![round-table-before gv](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1522319/56123511-74d62580-5f29-11e9-9dc2-2833a07e153d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nModel

Description ##\r\nChange all reduce in the LayerNorm operator to the \"safe\" version introduced in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14616. In essence, the safe version uses a higher-precision dtype to store the result of reduction. This may avoid the non-convergence problem in training Bert using Float16.\r\n\r\nPartially solves https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14073.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Always use the safe reduction in LayerNorm\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Similar to https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14073, the change is backward-incompatiable. The results of LayerNorm will be different when the input type is float16.","created_at":"2019-04-15T08:05:58Z","updated_at":"2019-05-20T08:28:10Z","closed_at":"2019-05-20T08:28:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0febec6ff5bd89bfb61961293abe3f558ed18754","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nIn #14522, problems of custom op exception handling are reported. #14575 tries to fix them by modify custom op implementation, which causes blocking in custom thread.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to address the issue by modifying engine:\r\n\r\n1. Add kNoSkip operation to force execution even with associated exception\r\n2. Since NDArray is duplicated in custom op with shared data, their exception status may not be synchronized,  so `Throw` method is added in engine to re-throw associated exception on var.\r\n3. Users are free to use sync operation like `asnumpy` or `wait_to_read` in custom op to block custom thread, so unlimited number of threads are still needed to avoid deadlock.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle: oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction, because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle.

Description ##\r\nFixes (partially) https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13193. \r\nWe were allowing non 2D NDArrays to be created as a CSR that caused inconsistencies and also caused a

The crash was coming from here : https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/tensor/cast_storage-inl.h#L238. \r\nThe other places constructing CSRNDArray are already guarded by

changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the

Description ##\r\nMaking the follwing on evetn handlers based on the design here:\r\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Callback+Design+for+Fit+Loop\r\n\r\n1. Making metric update and validation logic in event handlers\r\n2. Each event handler maintain it's own states\r\n3. Passing a weak reference of estimator at each callback call, so some attributes are passed(net, trainer, etc)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created

correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2,

Description ##\r\nThe [Hawkes process](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HawkesProcess.html) is a temporal point process model for self-exciting phenomena such as earthquakes, limit orders (finance), neuronal stimuli and social media activity. \r\n\r\nThis operator computes the log likelihood of a set of \"marked\" Hawkes processes, whose observations are represented in variable length (ragged) tensors. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\nAfter adding the waitall PR the nightlies started failing and was reported here : https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14397#issuecomment-481821129 \r\nThis was because waitall rethrowing exceptions that were hidden earlier.\r\nSeems like operator-= for ProfileCounter is called during frees which checks if the amount to be freed is greater than alloced. Added a check before operator is called. \r\n\r\nMore permanent fix would be to understand why memory pool counters are incorrect when free is called but this PR should stop the profiler nightly test failures.\r\n\r\n@ThomasDelteil \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where

\"./model/synset.txt\" --image \"./model/dog.jpg\" --gpu`\r\nthere will be segmentation fault.

(i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes the feature/deprecation warnings and makes them display as part of the Maven run by default. Most of the fixes are related to the change to IndexedSeq[DataDesc]. Contains a part of #13995.\r\n\r\n@lanking520 @andrewfayres \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR provides the infrastructure of supporting zero-dim and zero-size tensors as the first outcome of the initiative of introducing NumPy compatible coding experience into MXNet (see this [RFC](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14253)). Great thanks to many folks who have contributed design, implementation and code review to this feature. The credits should go to all of them. Sorry if I missed anyone below. It would be impossible to make so many things correct scattered all over the codebase with just a couple of hands.\r\n- C++ backend and Python: @junrushao1994 @eric-haibin-lin @szha @zheng-da @wkcn @mli \r\n- MKLDNN: @pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @lihaofd @ZhennanQin\r\n- Scala: @yzhliu \r\n- R: @hetong007 \r\n- Perl: @sergeykolychev \r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n### What are zero-dim and zero-size tensors?\r\n- Zero-dim tensors are scalars with shape equal to `()`.\r\n- A zero-size tensor is the one whose shape has at least one dimension size as `0`. For example, `np.ones((1, 0, 3))` would generate a zero-size tensor with shape equal to `(1, 0, 3)`.\r\n\r\n### Why are they important?\r\nMathematically speaking, their presence keeps the completeness and consistency of the all the tensor operations. For example, given `x = mx.nd.array([1, 2, 3])`, `x[0]` should return `1`, instead of `[1]`, and `x[0:0]` should return `[]` with shape equal to `(0,)`. Zero-size tensors can also be convenient in easing the code logic as placeholders for accumulations or aggregations.\r\n\r\n**I find [this thread](https://discuss.mxnet.io/t/rank-0-arrays-in-mxnet-aka-pi-is-wrong/108) provides very good insights on the importance of zero-dim tensors.**\r\n\r\n### How are they implemented?\r\nIn the backend (C++), we use `ndim = -1` to represent unknown shapes and `dim_size = -1` for unknown dim sizes. Before, they were represented by `0`.\r\n\r\n### Is backward compatibility guaranteed in this PR?\r\nYes, the backward compatibility is guaranteed by default. That means `0` still represents unknown `ndim` or dim size in any frontend language bindings. It's just converted to `-1` in the infer shape logic of the backend.\r\n\r\n### How to enable zero-dim or zero-size tensors?\r\nSince we are committed to keep backward compatibility, we provided APIs for users to decide whether to opt in for this NumPy compatibility. Users can call `mx.set_np_compat(True)` to opt in and `mx.set_np_compat(False)` to opt out. Or in a safer way, use the `with` statement. To turn on this:\r\n```python\r\n with mx.np_compat(active=True):\r\n     # A scalar tensor's shape is `()`, whose `ndim` is `0`.\r\n     scalar = mx.nd.ones(shape=())\r\n     assert scalar.shape == ()\r\n \r\n     # In NumPy compatible mode, 0 in a shape means that dimension contains zero elements.\r\n     data = mx.sym.var(\"data\", shape=(0, 2, 3))\r\n     ret = mx.sym.sin(data)\r\n     arg_shapes, out_shapes, _ = ret.infer_shape()\r\n     assert arg_shapes[0] == (0, 2, 3)\r\n     assert out_shapes[0] == (0, 2, 3)\r\n \r\n     # -1 means unknown shape dimension size in the new NumPy-compatible shape definition\r\n     data = mx.sym.var(\"data\", shape=(-1, 2, 3))\r\n     ret = mx.sym.sin(data)\r\n     arg_shapes, out_shapes, _ = ret.infer_shape_partial()\r\n     assert arg_shapes[0] == (-1, 2, 3)\r\n     assert out_shapes[0] == (-1, 2, 3)\r\n \r\n     # When a shape is completely unknown in NumPy-compatible mode, it is\r\n     # represented as `None` in Python.\r\n     data = mx.sym.var(\"data\")\r\n     ret = mx.sym.sin(data)\r\n     arg_shapes, out_shapes, _ = ret.infer_shape_partial()\r\n     assert arg_shapes[0] is None\r\n     assert out_shapes[0] is None\r\n```\r\nor to disable this:\r\n```python\r\n with mx.np_compat(active=False):\r\n     # 0 means unknown shape dimension size in the legacy shape definition.\r\n     data = mx.sym.var(\"data\", shape=(0, 2, 3))\r\n     ret = mx.sym.sin(data)\r\n     arg_shapes, out_shapes, _ = ret.infer_shape_partial()\r\n     assert arg_shapes[0] == (0, 2, 3)\r\n     assert out_shapes[0] == (0, 2, 3)\r\n \r\n     # When a shape is completely unknown in the legacy mode (default), its ndim is\r\n     # equal to 0 and it is represented as `()` in Python.\r\n     data = mx.sym.var(\"data\")\r\n     ret = mx.sym.sin(data)\r\n     arg_shapes, out_shapes, _ = ret.infer_shape_partial()\r\n     assert arg_shapes[0] == ()\r\n     assert out_shapes[0] == ()\r\n```\r\n### Does this mean that every existing operator should support zero-dim or zero-size tensors in this PR?\r\nPlease note that the existing operators were implemented when these two types of tensors were not supported in MXNet. Some strong assumptions may have been made in their implementation and hence, lead to errors when NumPy compatibility is turned on. This PR only provides the infrastructure of supporting zero-dim and zero-size tensors in the backend. It does not guarantee that every existing operator would deal with zero-dim/size tensors correctly as in NumPy. As discussed in the [RFC](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14253), we are going to implement NumPy operators under `mxnet.numpy` that would fully support these two types of tensors.","created_at":"2019-04-10T07:39:09Z","updated_at":"2019-09-03T12:23:41Z","closed_at":"2019-04-16T17:00:54Z","merged_at":"2019-04-16T17:00:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"3f3ba92ae1468d08de088d2291ca14e2d5dc5515","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1232775555,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjMyNzc1NTU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Numpy","name":"Numpy","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14661/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14661/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/14661/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/bd7c4fb8b7fc166a6a41d1095e03d42045af7d27","head":{"label":"reminisce:final_merge_numpy_to_master","ref":"final_merge_numpy_to_master","sha":"bd7c4fb8b7fc166a6a41d1095e03d42045af7d27","user":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":79397572,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3OTM5NzU3Mg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"reminisce/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reminisce","id":4978794,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5Nzg3OTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4978794?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce","html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reminisce/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reminisce/mxnet","descri

Description ##\r\nIt seems that `pickle` is not necessary in gluon dataloder.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-10T04:06:57Z","updated_at":"2019-04-20T07:40:12Z","closed_at":"2019-04-20T07:40:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0ed71a9059e553c41061b37423e235b5d5ea2aa0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis fixes Scala compiler warnings due to bad links in docs and types for macros. It also removes printing during tests or switches it to debug messages. Contains a part of #13995.\r\n\r\n@lanking520 @andrewfayres\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-09T23:55:40Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T22:18:23Z","closed_at":"2019-04-10T21:02:43Z","merged_at":"2019-04-10T21:02:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"8f0878c9b424aa9a1f575d22ce9b20e4e4254b93","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

[MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nFixed the TensorRT test failure with a nvidia driver update on the CI host side, this has been merged into production on MXNet CI General: https://github.com/MXNetEdge/mxnet_ci_general/pull/106\r\n\r\nThis test can be reenabled safely.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments

Description ##\r\nThis PR enable ssd training and f32/int8 evaluation on coco2014 dataset.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- enable int8 inference on coco2014 dataset on CPU with MKL-DNN backend. Int8 inference achieves 0.253 mAP, which is a comparable accuracy to FP32 (0.2552 mAP).\r\n- replace SoftmaxActivation with softmax since the it has been deprecated.\r\n- support making packed binary file of coco dataset.\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @zhreshold \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-09T00:49:40Z","updated_at":"2019-04-10T04:40:56Z","closed_at":"2019-04-10T04:40:56Z","merged_at":"2019-04-10T04:40:56Z","merge_commit_sha":"d596b59ba6412fb3236b909ee43099324cc92803","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"astonzhang","id":22279212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMjc5MjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22279212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang","html_url":"https://github.com/astonzhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/astonzhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"hetong007","id":1289856,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODk4NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1289856?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007","html_url":"https://github.com/hetong007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hetong007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14646/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14646/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/14646/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/a8118735f133ae9ac2af3774067b06a4f9e5e164","head":{"label":"xinyu-intel:ssd_coco","ref":"ssd_coco","sha":"a8118735f133ae9ac2af3774067b06a4f9e5e164","user":{"login":"xinyu-intel","id":17897736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17897736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyu-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123092331,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMwOTIzMzE=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"xinyu-intel/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinyu-intel","id":17897736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17897736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu

Description ##\r\nPreviously paramObj are created in a weird way. This is a fix to that:\r\n`NDArray.new paramObj` -> `new paramObj`\r\n\r\nThe trick is to put these param classes outside of NDArray Base and it made it accessible to the public directly under `org.apache.mxnet.javaapi`\r\n\r\n@andrewfayres @zachgk @yzhliu @nswamy \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-08T22:24:00Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T22:11:34Z","closed_at":"2019-04-27T03:40:18Z","merged_at":"2019-04-27T03:40:18Z","merge_commit_sha":"003800c50bdab98443f32e6dac4e227d9384a2ba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAs title.\r\nMigration from using mshadow to new fused kernel.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] New fused kernel\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nPreviously concat was [based on mshadow](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/src/operator/channel_op_common.h#L36-L55), which loops over all the input tensors and assign to a slice of the output tensor. The new kernel is a fused one to parallelize this part of the assignment.","created_at":"2019-04-08T18:58:47Z","updated_at":"2019-11-20T01:45:50Z","closed_at":"2019-11-20T01:45:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bafc9c74f233cc1e3a9f76f3d00fe731523e4aa5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"zheng-da","id":70481,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70481?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da","html_url":"https://github.com/zheng-da","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zheng-da/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR has fixed failing tests of numpy branch in CI except the following ones:\r\n1. Perl compilation issue has been fixed, but the unit tests stilll cannot pass. @sergeykolychev will take care of that.\r\n2. One Scala unit test cannot pass, and @yzhliu will look into it.\r\n3. Python TensorRT unit test is flaky due to a CUDA driver issue. This is a common problem on the master branch as well, so we are not blocked by this.\r\n\r\n@eric-haibin-lin @junrushao1994 @szha @yzhliu @zheng-da

Description ##\r\nThis pull request implements `index_array`, an operator that returns an array of indexes of the input array.\r\n\r\nFor an input array with shape `(d_1, d_2, ..., d_n)`, `index_array` returns a `(d_1, d_2, ..., d_n, n)` array `idx`, where `idx[i_1, i_2, ..., i_n, :] = [i_1, i_2, ..., i_n]`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when the parameter `axes` is specified, `idx` will be a `(d_1, d_2, ..., d_n, m)` array where `m` is the length of `axes`, and the following\r\nequality will hold: `idx[i_1, i_2, ..., i_n, j] = i_{axes[j]}`.\r\n\r\n### Examples: ###\r\n    x =

construction. For instance, this operator can be used to make a makeshift prior box generator for anchor-based computer vision models:\r\n\r\n    feature_map = F.ones((8, 128, 128, 256)) # N x H x W x C, no shape information when using the Symbol API.\r\n    prior_box_stride = 16\r\n    box_size=[8, 8]\r\n\r\n    template = F.squeeze(F.slice_axis(feature_map, begin=0, end=1, axis=-1), axis=-1) # N x H x W\r\n    box_centres = F.contrib.index_array(template, axes=(-2, -1, -2, -1)).astype(\"float32\") # N x H x W x 4\r\n    box_centres = F.broadcast_mul(box_centres, F.array([prior_box_stride]).reshape((1, 1, 1, 1))) # N x H x W x 4\r\n    corner_offsets = F.array(box_size).reshape((1, 1, 1, 2))\r\n    corner_offsets = F.concat(-corner_offsets/2, corner_offsets/2, dim=-1)\r\n    box_corners = F.broadcast_plus(box_centres, corner_offsets)\r\n\r\nAlso, this operator can be applied to implement positional encodings for sequence processing, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    sequence_embeddings = F.ones((65, 8, 256)) # T x N x C, no shape information when using the Symbol API.\r\n    template = sequence_embeddings.reshape((0, 0, -1, 2)) # T x N x C -> T x N x (C/2) x 2\r\n    pos, i = F.split(\r\n        F.contrib.index_array(template, axes=(0, 2)).astype(\"float32\"), # T x N x (C/2) x 2 x 2\r\n        axis=-1,\r\n        num_outputs=2,\r\n        squeeze_axis=True\r\n    ) # T x N x (C/2) x 2 and T x N x (C/2) x 2\r\n    base = F.ones((1, 1, 1, 1)) * 10000\r\n    dmodel = F.slice_axis(F.shape_array(sequence_embeddings), begin=-1, end=None, axis=0)\r\n    dmodel = dmodel.reshape((1, 1, 1, 1)).astype(\"float32\")\r\n    tmp = F.broadcast_div(pos, F.broadcast_power(base, F.broadcast_div(2 * i,  dmodel))) # T x N x (C/2) x 2\r\n    sin_input, cos_input = F.split(tmp, axis=-1, num_outputs=2, squeeze_axis=True) # T x N x (C/2) and T x N x (C/2)\r\n    positional_encoding = F.stack(F.sin(sin_input), F.cos(cos_input), axis=-1).reshape((0, 0, -3)) # T x N x C\r\n\r\nI've also encountered situations where this operator would have been useful for some indexing tricks.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] The IndexArray operator (for the CPU)\r\n- [x] The IndexArray operator (for the GPU)\r\n- [x] Tests for the CPU implementation\r\n- [x] Tests for the GPU implementation\r\n- [x] Entries on the Python API reference pages\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- This operator always returns kInt64.\r\n- The new tests in `test_operator_gpu.py` are exactly the same as in `test_operator.py`. I couldn't find any evidence that `test_operator.py` ever gets called with a GPU `default_context`, so I copied the tests into `test_operator_gpu.py` to make sure that the GPU implementation works

Description ##\r\nAdd PyPi cu100mkl CI test  to avoid manual test when updating the dependencies\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n1. add PyPi cu100mkl test\r\n2. align scala naming convention with PyPi\r\n\r\n\r\n## Comments

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be

Description ##\r\nmove estimator to contrib first\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-05T19:59:29Z","updated_at":"2019-04-05T20:10:59Z","closed_at":"2019-04-05T20:10:58Z","merged_at":"2019-04-05T20:10:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffad48a7b157ef70d4e35955d0b2f5e2f63287a7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14633/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/14633/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/14633/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/4ed1325202702504c3b5d203ae73ee59e64c66f8","head":{"label":"roywei:contrib","ref":"contrib","sha":"4ed1325202702504c3b5d203ae73ee59e64c66f8","user":{"login":"roywei","id":8022184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjIxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8022184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei","html_url":"https://github.com/roywei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121693282,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjE2OTMyODI=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"roywei/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"roywei","id":8022184,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwMjIxODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8022184?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei","html_url":"https://github.com/roywei","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/roywei/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/roywei/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR replaces https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/14579; when I retargeted that from 1.3.x to master, the Jenkins CI build got confused somehow, and refuses to start new test runs (though the Travis build was fine).  All the comments from the review of that PR should be addressed in this changeset.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds operators for computing the densities of samples drawn from any of the various distributions defined in operator/random, as well as their gradients, plus also the Dirichlet even though we don't yet have a sampler for it.  There are lots of changes to test_random.py to test each PDF alongside its distribution; aside from that, the patch should be entirely stand-alone.  See pdf_op.cc for more-detailed description strings.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR is to support higher order gradient in some basic unary operators. Thanks to @sxjscience, this PR is a continued work of https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12821.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds additional support for relu operator and fixed the issue of negative operator support in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/12821. In addition, I added unit tests for to test higher order gradient.\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] higher order gradient for a set of unary operators\r\n- [X] unit test to test higher order gradient\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-04T00:01:34Z","updated_at":"2019-06-10T18:13:23Z","closed_at":"2019-06-10T18:13:23Z","merged_at":"2019-06-10T18:13:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"3c82ce2405d806c9a6e3de4d3abc9c0446f87b65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues

Now requantize can support output uint8 if could.\r\n \r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv  @reminisce @anirudh2290\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-03T08:22:04Z","updated_at":"2019-10-28T02:41:46Z","closed_at":"2019-04-28T01:19:37Z","merged_at":"2019-04-28T01:19:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"6c600250f2a8516443c7909d156cbb522ad9c395","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"TaoLv","id":22437510,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM3NTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22437510?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv","html_url":"https://github.com/TaoLv","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/TaoLv/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":998884732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTg4ODQ3MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Quantization","name":"Quantization","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Issues/Feature

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-03T05:34:53Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T02:58:23Z","closed_at":"2019-04-04T02:58:23Z","merged_at":"2019-04-04T02:58:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"7983ef1cd4fd8e4895c158f35f57e200d71817c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":998884732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTg4ODQ3MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Quantization","name":"Quantization","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Issues/Feature

Description ##\r\n\r\nAdd a test for big matrix multiplications that overflow gemm int32 indexes.\r\n\r\nThis test checks that an exception is thrown instead of calling gemm with wrong indices which causes segfaults or wrong results.\r\n\r\nFor more info see related issues and PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14522 https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/pull/372\r\n\r\n##

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\n''''''''''''\r\nuse_global_stats (boolean, optional, default=0) – Whether use global moving statistics instead of local batch-norm. This will force change batch-norm into a scale shift operator\r\n\r\n'''''''''\r\nWhen use_global_stats is true, the parameters of this layer remain unchanged, which should be applied in the case of test, while in the process of training, make sure that use_global_stats is not true, of course, use_global_stats is false by default.\r\n\r\n''''''''\r\nWhen I look at faster rcnn, why is his BN layer use_global_stats all True? It's supposed to be False when I train.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here","created_at":"2019-04-02T12:57:56Z","updated_at":"2019-04-04T01:40:59Z","closed_at":"2019-04-04T01:39:50Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ab842b346f2b29e503e9bb1532c5651eac3e17f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":718413113,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MTg0MTMxMTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Example","name":"Example","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes an issue we're seeing in TRT integration which causes a crash on shutdown.  I believe the issue should be present under other usages as well.  This PR tracks a weak reference on the engine to ensure we don't try to schedule work on the engine after it has been shutdown (for example cleaning up memory from NDChunks that are still in scope).\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis PR infers the batch size from` gluon.data.DataLoader` in fit() API so that the end user doesn't need to provide a batch size during fit() call. This PR also adds the verbose option in logging handler where the end user can control the granularity of logging information.\r\n\r\nI haven't removed the `batch_size=None` option in fit() API for now. This will be addressed in separate PR as there will be modification in Integration, Unit test, and tutorial which uses fit() API with `batch_size` option. (DONE)\r\n\r\nJIRA epic for FIT-API: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues/MXNET-1333\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for

Description ##\r\nFixes #14505 \r\n\r\nAspect ratio goes out of bounds when the bounds are not reciprocals. Fixed by sampling from log scale instead of linear scale. When sampling from log scale, random swapping of width/height is not required since the distribution is centered at 1.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-04-01T19:21:08Z","updated_at":"2019-04-08T18:07:17Z","closed_at":"2019-04-08T18:07:17Z","merged_at":"2019-04-08T18:07:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"4530ad8f4b7b661a985ad668f2668f9476848a81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds operators for computing the densities of samples drawn from any of the various distributions defined in operator/random, as well as their gradients.  There are lots of changes to test_random.py to test each PDF alongside its distribution; aside from that, the patch should be entirely stand-alone.  See pdf_op.cc for more-detailed description strings.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge,

Description ##\r\n(Brief description on what this PR is about)\r\nThe \"python-howto\" was removed in a previous commit \"3e8a976d805dee130831d4f54b7a5dd9f1a7c7bd\". The reference to this folder wasn't removed from the README file. Removed the reference in this PR.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nThis PR fix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14496.\r\n\r\nThe performance degradation is introduced by PR https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11742. I have verified the performance degradation in one of the operators transpose using a script below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nimport time\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nsizes = [10, 50, 100,200,500]\r\niters = [10000,1000,500,200,20]\r\ntimes = []\r\nfor size in range(len(sizes)):\r\n    data = []\r\n    s = sizes[size]\r\n    print(s)\r\n    for i in range(iters[size]):\r\n        x = mx.nd.ones((s,s,s))\r\n        mx.nd.waitall()\r\n        start = time.time()\r\n        y = mx.nd.transpose(x,(2,0,1))\r\n        mx.nd.waitall()\r\n        data.append((time.time() - start)*1000)\r\n        #print(data[-1])                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n    times.append(data)\r\n\r\nprint('mxnet version: %s' % mx.__version__)\r\nfor s in range(len(sizes)):\r\n    print('--------------------')\r\n    print('size: %s' % str(sizes[s]))\r\n    print('p50: %4.2f ms' % np.percentile(times[s],50))\r\n    print('p90: %4.2f ms' % np.percentile(times[s],90))\r\n    print('p99: %4.2f ms' % np.percentile(times[s],99))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy changing the `index_t` type from `int64_t` to `int32_t` can consistently change the 50-percentile runtime of tranpose of size 500 from 5000ms to 2400ms. \r\n\r\nBy changing the data type in the operator (https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/blob/master/mshadow/extension/transpose.h#L70) alone, can also reduce the 50-percentile runtime of size 500 to 2600ms.\r\n\r\nI thereforce come to the conclusion that the performance degradation is caused by the runtime of  integer arithmetic operations between 32-bit integers and 64-bit integers.\r\n\r\nTo further experiment with the arithmetic operations alone, I tested using a small program [here](https://github.com/apeforest/doraemon/blob/master/perf32vs64.cc). The runtime results are shown below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresult = 49995000\r\nAdd 32-bit time in ms 1359\r\nresult = 49995000\r\nAdd 64-bit time in ms 1971\r\nresult = 349965000\r\nAdd Mul 32-bit time in ms 1196\r\nresult = 349965000\r\nAdd Mul 64-bit time in ms 3477\r\nresult = 7137858\r\nAdd Div 32-bit time in ms 2878\r\nresult = 7137858\r\nAdd Div 64-bit time in ms 8499\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can think of three solutions to this problem:\r\n(1) Add a compilation flag to choose data types for tensor size (This PR)\r\n(2) Add an environment variable to choose data type for tensor size at runtime\r\n(3) Choose data type for tensor size at runtime based on the size of the tensor\r\n\r\nGiven the expression template used in mshadow for operators, either (2) or (3) requries a significant change in the mshadow library. (1) can be used as a quick solution to fix performance degradation reported in several issues: https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14496, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13928, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14563, https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/14569\r\n\r\nAny other suggestion is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis PR also depends on https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow/pull/371\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-03-29T18:11:47Z","updated_at":"2019-04-26T11:51:42Z","closed_at":"2019-04-23T21:47:11Z","merged_at":"2019-04-23T21:47:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"0f63659be5070af218095a6a460427d2a1b67aba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":993234718,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTMyMzQ3MTg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Backend","name":"Backend","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":"Issues related to the backend of MXNet"},{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note
