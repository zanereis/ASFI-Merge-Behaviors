PR implements a conv operator for INT8 operations for Intel Skylake and upcoming Intel processors. Currently, this supports input of NCHWc format. Later, there will be NNVM effort to pick up this kernel for conv and perform kernel transform using \"CorrectLayout\". This PR tackles only the schedule for INT8 conv kernel.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n**Hardware support**\r\nSkylake provides HW support of performing a dot product of 2 4-int8 values while keeping the computational precision at INT32. For Skylake these instructions are vpamaddubsw, vpmaddwd. This support will be enhanced for VNNI instruction. More details can be found at this link (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/lower-numerical-precision-deep-learning-inference-and-training). \r\n\r\n**Why new schedule?**\r\nThese instructions require some modifications to the current FP32 schedule. The current schedule does not perform reduction across different elements of a vector register. But, Intel instructions allow reduction across 4 int8 values. Therefore, a new schedule is required. \r\n\r\n**Why not just rely on LLVM for codegen?**\r\nLLVM codegen is not mature for generating these instructions. LLVM has a very restrictive pattern matching to lower down to these INT8 operations. We will need decent efforts on both LLVM and TVM side to reach an IR where LLVM can directly generate these instructions. Therefore, I am currently calling LLVM intrinsics directly from LLVM.\r\n\r\n# Performance Speedup\r\nThese are different conv layers from resnet network. I don't have NNVM changes yet to run an end-to-end experiment. Will update these numbers when we have that. \r\n\r\nWorkload | kernelSize | FP32 time | INT8 time | Speedup\r\n-- | -- | -- | -- | --\r\nWorkload#0 | 3x3 | 1.27E-04 | 7.61E-05 | 1.668205764\r\nWorkload#1 | 1x1 | 1.45E-05 | 1.62E-05 | 0.8956588432\r\nWorkload#2 | 3x3 | 9.77E-05 | 4.52E-05 | 2.163945956\r\nWorkload#3 | 1x1 | 9.56E-06 | 8.55E-06 | 1.117662311\r\nWorkload#4 | 3x3 | 0.000124318896 | 9.35E-05 | 1.32998721\r\nWorkload#5 | 3x3 | 8.53E-05 | 4.26E-05 | 2.00352076\r\nWorkload#6 | 1x1 | 9.68E-06 | 8.45E-06 | 1.145552654\r\nWorkload#7 | 3x3 | 0.000101081785 | 8.07E-05 | 1.252166183\r\nWorkload#8 | 3x3 | 7.25E-05 | 4.82E-05 | 1.502493515\r\nWorkload#9 | 1x1 | 9.35E-06 | 7.04E-06 | 1.328638704\r\nWorkload#10 | 3x3 | 0.000118993864 | 9.70E-05 | 1.226515769\r\nWorkload#11 | 1x1 | 0.000117436952 | 5.97E-05 | 1.966779456\r\nWorkload#12 | 1x1 | 0.000121834512 | 6.08E-05 | 2.00419261\r\nWorkload#13 | 1x1 | 6.25E-05 | 2.78E-05 | 2.245298107\r\nWorkload#14 | 1x1 | 0.000106934483 | 4.96E-05 | 2.157467654\r\nWorkload#15 | 1x1 | 0.000280448215 | 9.23E-05 | 3.038109489\r\nWorkload#16 | 1x1 | 0.000118953154 | 5.06E-05 | 2.351587926\r\nWorkload#17 | 1x1 | 3.67E-05 | 2.20E-05 | 1.666902107\r\nWorkload#18 | 1x1 | 4.73E-05 | 3.66E-05 | 1.293318986\r\nWorkload#19 | 1x1 | 0.000132912593 | 7.11E-05 | 1.868658243\r\nWorkload#20 | 1x1 | 5.77E-05 | 3.91E-05 | 1.474495608\r\nWorkload#21 | 1x1 | 3.15E-05 | 1.70E-05 | 1.858185831\r\nWorkload#22 | 1x1 | 5.08E-05 | 2.74E-05 | 1.851147766\r\nWorkload#23 | 1x1 | 0.000111464776 | 5.45E-05 | 2.044977186\r\nWorkload#24 | 1x1 | 5.70E-05 | 3.06E-05 | 1.85923854\r\n  |   |   | Mean ---> | 1.732588287\r\n\r\n# Limitations\r\n- Current implementation requires input_channels to be a multiple of 4 and output_channels to be a multiple of 16. For other conv layers, we plan to use the FP32 schedule and not use avx512 bw instructions. If performance becomes a big concern, we can look into input channel padding.

[RFC]: Relay a new high level IR for TVM\r\n\r\nRelay is a new high level intermediate representation (IR) intended to act as v2.0 of NNVM.\r\n\r\nSee #1673 for the full RFC details.\r\n\r\n## Python 2.7 Support\r\n\r\nOur goal is to adapt the core IR code to support 2.7 as well as 3.X. We plan on addressing this near the end of the PR review window after other TODOs have been addressed.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nThis PR was extracted from a larger work-in-progress version of Relay, and as such it still needs some additional features before it is ready to merge into TVM mainline. We are opening the PR in a \"nearly finished\" state so other contributors can provide review and feedback on the alpha design and implementation of Relay.\r\n\r\n## Core IR \r\n- [x] Add base nodes for IR\r\n- [x] Add `Type` nodes for IR\r\n- [x] Add `Expr` nodes for IR\r\n- [x] IR C++ Docs\r\n- [ ] IR Python Docs\r\n- [x] Add operator registry with TVM integration\r\n- [x] Add new attribute system exposed in C++ and Python\r\n- [x] Improve construction of nodes\r\n- [x] Add type inference for Relay\r\n   + [x] Fix helpers in the Environment\r\n   + [ ] Add few more type relation examples.\r\n   + [ ] Restore kind checker\r\n   + [x] Increase test coverage\r\n- [x] Add compiler to TVM runtime for Relay \r\n   + [x] Port mono-morphization pass \r\n   + [x] Port TVM RTS compiler\r\n- [x] Demonstrate writing a pass in both C++ (type inference) and Python.\r\n- [ ] IR Builder Docs\r\n- [ ] Restore code for printing NDArray's in Numpy style\r\n- [ ] Restore error display\r\n\r\n## Code Map\r\n\r\nThis section contains a high level overview of the code organization by file.\r\n\r\n### Core IR\r\n- `include/tvm/relay/base.h` and `src/relay/ir/base.cc` contain the base classes for Relay AST.\r\n    We reuse the `tvm::Node` infrastructure to enable Python interoperability.\r\n- `include/tvm/relay/type.h` and `src/relay/ir/type.cc` contain the type classes for the Relay Type AST. \r\n- `include/tvm/relay/expr.h` and `src/relay/ir/expr.cc` contain the expression classes for the Relay expression AST. This is a small functional language with functions, control-flow, operators, and constants.\r\n- `include/tvm/relay/op.h` and `src/relay/ir/op.cc` contains the definition of the Relay operator registry. Relay's operator registry stores high level information about operators such as type, and metadata useful for optimization similar to NNVM.\r\n- `include/tvm/relay/environment.h` and `src/relay/ir/environment.cc` contains the global environment, which contains all global functions and configuration options for the compiler.\r\n- `include/tvm/relay/error.h`\r\n- `include/tvm/relay/expr_functor.h` and `include/tvm/relay/expr_visitor.h` define traversal strategies over Relay expressions.\r\n- `include/tvm/relay/logging.h` contains a wrapper around logging which can be controlled with an environment variable. This is useful for extra logging information while debugging the compiler.\r\n- `include/tvm/relay/pass.h` exports the current set of Relay passes (only type inference right now).\r\n- include/tvm/relay/source_map.h src/relay/source_map.cc\r\n\r\n### Operators\r\n- `src/relay/op/tensor/elemwise.cc` provides examples of registering Relay operators.\r\n- `src/relay/op/type_relations.cc` and `src/relay/op/type_relations.h` defines common\r\ntype relations (i.e shape inference functions) for operators.\r\n\r\n### Type Inference \r\n- `include/tvm/relay/pass/type_infer.h` and `src/relay/pass/type_infer.cc` implement type inference, and type checking. Given a Relay expression (`e`) they infer a type (`T`) written (`e : T`) and check that `e` has type `T`. This process proceeds by building partial types for an expression and iteratively filling the type in by solving constraints introduced in the program.\r\n- `src/relay/pass/incomplete_type.h` introduces an \"incomplete type\" (known as a type variable in the programming language and compiler literature), this represents a portion of the type we do not yet know.\r\n- `src/relay/pass/unifier.h` and `src/relay/pass/unifier.cc` implement type [unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)). They solve equations between types which arise due to type inference/checking, the idea is that there are some unknown portions of the type (incomplete types) and our goal is to fill them in given a set of equations on types. \r\n- `include/tvm/relay/pass/alpha_eq.h` and `src/relay/pass/alpha_eq.cc` implements structural equivalence of Relay types and expressions. This is called alpha equivalence in the programming language and compiler literature.\r\n- `src/relay/pass/resolve.h` and `src/relay/pass/resolve.cc` implement a procedure which will resolve incomplete types into complete ones based on solutions in the unifier. \r\n- `src/relay/pass/type_functor.h` and `src/relay/pass/type_visitor.h` implement useful traversal strategies over types.\r\n- `src/relay/pass/type_subst.h` and `src/relay/pass/type_subst.cc` implement type substitution.\r\n\r\n### Python Core IR\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/__init__.py` is the entry point of the Relay namespace.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/_env.py` exports the FFI to the `Environment` and `python/tvm/relay/_env.pyi` adds MyPy stubs.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/_ir_pass.py` exports the FFI to the pass functions and `python/tvm/relay/_ir_pass.pyi` adds MyPy stubs.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/_make.py` exports the constructor functions used in `expr.py`, etc.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/base.py`, `python/tvm/relay/env.py`, `python/tvm/relay/expr.py`, and `python/tvm/relay/type.py` export their C++ counterparts to Python.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/ir_builder.py` contains a first attempt at an IRBuilder for Relay.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/ir_pass.py` contain the pass functions exported by Relay.\r\n\r\n## Python Operators\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/op/__init__.py` entry point into `relay.op` namespace.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/op/_make.py` exposes functions which build calls to each op.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/op/tensor.py` contains explicit definitions of operators which dispatch to the primitives defined in `op/_make.py`, this means Relay's Python API has explicit signatures for each op, and don't rely on `*args` and `**kwargs`.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/op/_tensor.py` backend registry for compiler related data about ops in `tensor.py`.\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/op/op.py` exposes functionality on the Operator Registry.\r\n\r\n## Python Compiler to TVM RTS\r\n- `python/tvm/relay/tvm_rts_backend.py` contains a soon to be updated version of a compiler from Relay to the TVM RTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Timeline\r\n\r\n- Complete PR checklists.\r\n- Leave PR open for ~2 weeks for review and feedback while finishing up TODOs.\r\n- Merge PR with @tqchen when he returns from vacation.\r\n\r\n# Thanks\r\n \r\nFinally I would like to thank all the people who helped out with the development of Relay. Although I am the author of most of these commits the work is derived from months of hard work from @MarisaKirisame @slyubomirsky @joshpoll @weberlo @tqchen and @ztatlock.\r\n","created_at":"2018-08-29T00:39:15Z","updated_at":"2021-02-04T04:36:02Z","closed_at":"2018-09-19T22:55:13Z","merged_at":"2018-09-19T22:55:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"51fe00fb9015f2f80cfcd3ac0085115b303bf3e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":540459689,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NDA0NTk2ODk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20RFC","name":"status:

Hopefully after this PR we can stabilize the measurement API.\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\n## Local\r\n\r\n#### CPU\r\n```python\r\n#### OLD API ####\r\nmeasure_option = autotvm.measure_opton('local', number=5)\r\n\r\n#### NEW API ####\r\nmeasure_option = autotvm.measure_option(\r\n    builder=autotvm.LocalBuilder(),          # use all local cpu cores for compilation\r\n    runner=autotvm.LocalRunner(number=5)     # measure them sequentially\r\n)\r\n```\r\n#### GPU\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#### OLD API ####\r\nmeasure_option = autotvm.measure_opton('local', number=10, n_parallel=8, timeout=20)\r\n\r\n#### NEW API ####\r\nmeasure_option = autotvm.measure_option(\r\n    builder=autotvm.LocalBuilder(),        # use all local cpu cores for compilation\r\n    runner=autotvm.LocalRunner(number=10, timeout=4)  # this timeout only counts the running cost on the device\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## RPC\r\n```python\r\n#### OLD API ####\r\nmeasure_option = autotvm.measure_opton(\r\n    autotvm.measure.rpc('rasp3b', 'localhost', 9190),\r\n    number=10,\r\n    timeout=10)  # This timeout is not good. It contains compilation + run + RPC request waiting time.\r\n\r\n#### NEW API ####\r\nmeasure_option = autotvm.measure_option(\r\n    builder=autotvm.LocalBuilder(),    # use all local cpu cores for compilation\r\n    runner=autotvm.RPCRunner(             \r\n        'rasp3b', 'locahost', 9190,\r\n        timeout=4)     # timeout of a run on the device. This does not count the RPC request waiting time\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Custom timeout and parallel\r\n* We can set separate timeout for building and running.\r\n* Previously we have to specify the number of devices by passing `n_parallel`. Now under the new timeout mechanism, we don't need this. Because we don't count the RPC request waiting time, we can always launch all request and let the tracker to schedule them.\r\nThe new API can support arbitrary number of devices without changing code.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n## NEW API ##\r\nmeasure_option = autotvm.measure_option(\r\n    builder=autotvm.LocalBuilder(\r\n        timeout=10,             # set timeout for compilation, too much unroll can cause timeout during compilation\r\n        n_parallel=4),          # start 4 threads\r\n    runner=autotvm.RPCRunner(             \r\n        'rasp3b', 'locahost', 9190,\r\n        timeout=4)             \r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @eqy @FrozenGene @kevinthesun @vinx13

issue with measurement on fast devices is that we need to automatically adjust `number` so that the measured time is large enough for precise measurement. A minimum measured time is also important for properly warming up some devices, e.g., GPUs with power states.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a `min_milliseconds` parameter to `measure_option` to enforce a minimum trial time. If a measurement falls below this threshold, `number` is increased and we repeat the measurement (this increase persists over the lifetime of the `measure_batch` function).","created_at":"2018-08-21T23:44:13Z","updated_at":"2018-08-26T01:00:10Z","closed_at":"2018-08-26T01:00:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f709bfed172d2964f480d817d8cd7c5d57879b96","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1627/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/1627/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/1627/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/e1d0cf4653ec2adad6838f253455bbf10a9bb154","head":{"label":"eqy:min-measure","ref":"min-measure","sha":"e1d0cf4653ec2adad6838f253455bbf10a9bb154","user":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":109762891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDk3NjI4OTE=","name":"tvm","full_name":"eqy/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"eqy","id":2239616,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyMzk2MTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2239616?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy","html_url":"https://github.com/eqy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eqy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/eqy/tvm","description":"End

far we introduced Map<string, NodeRef> for general attribute storage.  As we plan to upgrade the high-level IR, we would like to introduce more structure into it, specifically\r\n\r\n- We would like to have something like ```dmlc::Parameter``` that declares the default value and attribute value property\r\n-  We also want to take benefit of the TVM's node system(directly access from python side).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces attrs.h to solve the problem. The declaration API is relatively similar to dmlc::Parameter, and the Attrs is backed by the Node system. The general idea is that we declare the attribute in the C++, and it can be made accessible from the python side. We also introduce a DictAttrsNode that is backed by a dictionary, to mimic the python dict based object \r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Allow automatically set of default value when initialization value is not provided\r\n- Provide bound checking and doc generation as in dmlc::Parameter\r\n- Node system: field directly accessible from python side, serializable\r\n\r\n## C++ Declaration\r\n```c++\r\nstruct TestAttrs : public AttrsNode<TestAttrs> {\r\n  int axis;\r\n  std::string name;\r\n  Array<Expr> padding;\r\n   TVM_DECLARE_ATTRS(TestAttrs, \"attrs.TestAttrs\") {\r\n    TVM_ATTR_FIELD(axis)\r\n        .set_default(10)\r\n        .set_lower_bound(1)\r\n        .set_upper_bound(10)\r\n        .describe(\"axis field\");\r\n    TVM_ATTR_FIELD(name)\r\n        .describe(\"name\");\r\n    TVM_ATTR_FIELD(padding)\r\n        .describe(\"padding of input\")\r\n        .set_default(Array<Expr>({0, 0}));\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Python Side Access\r\n```python\r\ndef test_make_attrs():\r\n     x = tvm.make.node(\"attrs.TestAttrs\", name=\"xx\", padding=(3,4))\r\n    assert x.name == \"xx\"\r\n    assert x.padding[0].value == 3\r\n    assert x.padding[1].value == 4\r\n    assert x.axis == 10\r\n     \r\n    dattr = tvm.make.node(\"DictAttrs\", x=1, y=10, name=\"xyz\", padding=(0,0))\r\n    assert dattr.x.value ==

PR adds int8 gemm recipe tuned with AutoTVM to topi.\r\n\r\n### Some interesting facts\r\n\r\n* AutoTVM: Using AutoTVM to tune all tile sizes to unlikely to produce the best config because the config space is too huge. Narrowing the search space by adding a few constraints (e.g. removing too big / small sizes) speeds up tuning. The performance after 1000 trials is very close to the best performance I tuned manually.\r\n\r\n* Most performance gain is achieved by optimizing memory accesses. For example, using virtual threads (specifically 8x8 or 16x4 vthreads in this case). There are still a few bank conflicts not resolved. Bank conflicts when transferring data from shared memory to local memory cannot be resolved using storage alignment because int8x16 elements are loaded to shared memory from global memory. This pattern requires data to be aligned by 16 bytes and therefore I use 48 in `storage_align` which may be less helpful than a prime. Loading four int8 at a time solves the alignment constraint but is much slower.\r\n\r\n* Double buffering: The effect of double buffering is related to the block size. Sometimes it can be slower because of increased shared memory size or the number of registers used.\r\n \r\n* Shuffling: I tried to use the shuffle instruction instead of shared memory (using `cache_read` with warp scope) but did not achieve better performance. Also this imposes a constraint on thread numbers (currently TVM requires extent of threadIdx.x to be 32) and makes it less flexible.\r\n\r\n* cubin v.s. ptx: There are no preference for either one since they shows competing performance.\r\n\r\n* nvprof shows that some best config from AutoTVM uses too many registers. Building with `-maxrregcount` option can help (but the performance improvement is very small). This requires a custom cuda_compile callback. Since there is already one registered by AutoTVM, we need to forcedly register another callback.\r\n\r\n* It may be helpful to reorder the reduction in different threads. It shows ~2TOPS performance gain after manually changing generated CUDA code. But currently this is not supported.\r\n\r\nThe best performance tested on GTX1080 is ~21TOPS, while the speed of cuBLAS is ~29TOPS.\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @merrymercy

PR enables the return of NDArrayContainer in the RPC mode. When a remote function returns an NDArrayContainer, \r\n\r\n- A local NDArray is created whose data points to the space of the remote array, and the context is set as remote context. \r\n- Note that the meta-data(shape, dtype, ctx) is stored in the local location instead of the remote.\r\n- This enables direct set/get a remote NDArray space(via copyfrom/to) \r\n\r\n## Example Test Code\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test_rpc_return_ndarray():\r\n    # Use closure to check the ref counter correctness\r\n    nd = tvm.nd.array(np.zeros(10).astype(\"float32\"))\r\n

PR adds a Rust runtime which is useful when creating statically linked TVM modules--either native or Wasm. Indeed, Rust has the best Wasm support. It's also good for SGX.\r\n\r\nThe current code supports both TVM and NNVM modules. The API around `Tensor` conversions to `DLTensor` is a bit awkward since `DLTensor` isn't owned, but it shouldn't be too hard to iron out.\r\n\r\nThere's one nit, though: the `dshape` field in the `Tensor` struct exists solely because TVM uses `u64` as the `shape_t` even when on 32-bit platforms. I'll make a PR for this

is a simple stack-based virtual machine introduced in TVM. It acts as a simple interpreter to execute host side logic to do simple setups like GPU kernel dimension calculation. Originally it was intended to serve as a host side executor when LLVM is not available(which seems not as important now).\r\n\r\nThis refactor enables another use case -- to use stackvm as host-side executor in runtime, this might be useful for restricted cases when dynamic library loading is banned and we still want to ship and run GPU code via RPC.

PR decouples fusion and compilation which has been discussed in the issue [#1540](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/issues/1540). \r\n\r\nCurrently, lowering and fusion are implemented in the same pass. It would be more appropriate to make fusion and compilation as separate passes. This has the following benefits 1) fusion could be applied individually (even multiple times) in the future when necessary, 2) fusion could be target-independent while compilation (or lowering) is target-dependent.\r\n\r\nIn the future, we might need to make fusion more extendable so that different fusing rules could be applied in a more convenient manner.\r\n\r\nThis PR added graph_fuse.h to contain the fusion related structures and moved compilation related code to graph_compile.cc","created_at":"2018-08-07T18:12:24Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T21:22:21Z","closed_at":"2018-08-08T20:51:48Z","merged_at":"2018-08-08T20:51:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"53d243114d3d35d27c7b5bd90fafccb4d8d9dda0","assignee":{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

PR is to fix issue #1547 , The original plan is to expose the dmlc::Registry<T>::Get symbol in dmlc-core project, but later I found it does not work because nnvm is not only the consumer of dmlc::Registry symbol, but also need to enable registry on some new types, like:\r\n`DMLC_REGISTRY_ENABLE(nnvm::PassFunctionReg);`\r\n\r\nIf we add MACRO like DMLC_DLL in registry.h, it will fail in nnvm because Windows does not allow to implement a function that declared as dllimport. I am currently use a workaround that in tvm lib, we expose another method that allow other component to access the dmlc::Registry<::tvm::NodeFactoryReg> instance, so nnvm could consume that one instead directly invoke the Get method in dmlc header file. \r\n\r\nThis is the simplest solution I can think of at this moment, but not sure does it align with tvm's design. Let me know if you have any concern.","created_at":"2018-08-07T06:39:13Z","updated_at":"2018-08-08T17:11:59Z","closed_at":"2018-08-08T17:11:25Z","merged_at":"2018-08-08T17:11:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"60da47055a1e9f2ef3ecfa6efc70a0c8d21ddf5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

PR is going to fix #1547 , the root cause is because we static link dmlc-core to tvm shared lib, but on windows, by default the shared library won't expose the symbols (Need annotation like TVM_EXPORTS ). dmlc::Registry::Get is not exposed in this case, that is why we get the link error.\r\nI am using a quick fix that re-enable the registry in nnvm compiler shared lib, but not sure will cause any obj confliction on different platform. A better fix may be expose the symbol in dmlc-core, does tvm/dmlc team have any
