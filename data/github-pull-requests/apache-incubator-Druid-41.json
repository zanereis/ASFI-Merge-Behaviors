Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

My patch fixes the splitting of that hiddenProperties string. This fix causes the test to fail, alerting me to the fact that the filtering method is not working as intended. I went away from using the filtered map concept in the original patch, and instead removed the sensitive k:v pairs from a copy of the passed map and returned that modified map. This now passes the updated unit tests and has been verified in a cluster.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

changes:\r\n\r\n- When writing RexLiterals into Druid expressions, we now write non-integer numeric literals in such a way that ensures they are parsed as doubles on the other end. Fixes behavior where, in cases where literals are embedded in expressions, casts like `CAST(3 AS DOUBLE)` seemingly get \"lost\". I noticed this when doing `STRING_FORMAT('%.2f', CAST(3 AS DOUBLE))`. The expression was generated as `format('%.2f', 3)`, which led to an error since `f` expects floating point input. I bet other expressions could have had odd behavior too.\r\n\r\n- Fix a problem where expression literals could not represent Long.MIN_VALUE. Now, integer literals start life off as BigIntegerExpr instead of LongExpr, and are converted to LongExpr during flattening. This is necessary because  in order to avoid ambiguity between unary minus and negative literals, our grammar does not actually have true negative literals. Negative numbers must be represented as unary minus next to a positive literal.\r\n\r\n- Fix a bug  introduced in https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12230 where `shuttle.visitAll(args)` delegated to `shuttle.visit(arg)` instead of `arg.visit(shuttle)`. The latter does a recursive visitation, which is the intended behavior.","created_at":"2022-09-07T06:12:41Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:17:29Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T00:06:21Z","merged_at":"2022-09-13T00:06:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"77925cdcdd9c2da98c4cbf175cdb687e47ed07ed","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #9617, possibly others.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code?

Right now the config needs to either be a `PasswordProvider` or `DynamicConfigProvider` to be able to get the value from an environment variable or other location. While those still make sense for custom implementations (eg: reading values from a secret store) or for task specs, without moving every config to one of those types it makes it hard for an operator to set configuration values from the environment.\r\n\r\nThis PR uses commons-text to handle the interpolation and only supports a smaller subset of the available interpolations (see: https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/apidocs/org/apache/commons/text/lookup/StringLookupFactory.html). Upstream they are already looking to disable some of the current defaults as they execute code (javascript) or reach out to external machines (see: https://github.com/apache/commons-text/pull/341) so I started with a much smaller list that should unblock most issues people have.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `JsonConfigurator`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

problem was first reported by #12760 , and #12833 solves that specific issue.\r\nThis PR solves all potential problems by providing a group of type safe methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`QueryContext` holds values passed from user side in JSON format. \r\nAnd currently Druid requires values in JSON must be strictly type matched. \r\nFor example, a property `maxOnDiskStorage` in Druid is defined as integer, it must be in the format as \r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"context\": {\"maxOnDiskStorage\": 100} \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the number 100 is serialized as string as \r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"context\": {\"maxOnDiskStorage\": \"100\"} \r\n```\r\n\r\nDruid throws a `ClassCastException` to reject the input query.\r\n\r\n\r\nActually, string-formatted number \"100\" can be parsed as number at Druid server side. \r\n\r\n### Key changes\r\n\r\n#12833 adds a method `getContextHumanReadableBytes` to get context value from any acceptable format safely. And this PR adds a group of methods to do so and changes all existing code reference to the new APIs.\r\n\r\nNewly added methods are:\r\n\r\n```java\r\ngetContextAsInt\r\ngetContextAsLong\r\ngetContextAsFloat\r\ngetContextAsString\r\ngetContextAsEnum\r\ngetContextAsBoolean\r\n```\r\n\r\nOriginal unsafe method `getContextValue` is still kept to allow us get objects which are stored by Druid server side temporarily.\r\nSome javadoc is added to tell callers know which methods should be used instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [ ] added or updated version, license, or notice information in [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/license.md)\r\n- [ ] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [X] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [ ] added integration tests.\r\n- [ ] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-09-03T04:30:29Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:17:27Z","closed_at":"2022-09-13T10:00:10Z","merged_at":"2022-09-13T10:00:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"fd6c05eee8941c6fb3ade67217cb244748142dac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews.

These options don't work for druid-operator based deployments since the operator pushes the log4j2 xml to the service specific directories by default. \r\nThis PR provides an option to override log4j configs setup at the service level directories so that it works with usecases similar to above.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion.

all append ingestion jobs to a datasource use EXCLUSIVE locks on time intervals or segments by default. #12041 added a config to allow specifying a flag in the ingestion job context which tries to

support for doing a distinct and non-distinct count in SQL with multiple columns. \r\nFor the non-distinct count, the count aggregator is wrapped inside a filtering aggregator.

How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nThe first change is to avoid executing `resolveWaitingFuturesRunnable` if `ChangeRequestHistory#addChangeRequests` is called with an empty list of changes. It. is not obvious that this would regularly happen anywhere in the code, but to me, it makes sense to avoid resolving all of the waiting futures when there actually weren't any changes.\r\n\r\nThe second change is to no longer request a counter reset when the client counter matches the. latest counter in `ChangeRequestHistory#getRequestsSinceWithoutWait`. Resetting the counter in this case seems like an undesirable choice. I'd rather have the client get the same counter and an empty list of changes via a success response, and then re-submit a request for changes, then to get a resetCounter directive and have to make the server replay all of the served segments despite the client already having an up to date set locally. One note about this change is that I wasn't sure how to test it since there is no obvious way via the public API of ChangeRequestHistory to get it to execute `ChangeRequestHistory#getRequestsSinceWithoutWait` with a counter that matches the latest counter. The response to this could be, why even make the change then? And the answer to that is the logs listed in #12999 indicate we get in this state somehow some way in a live cluster. There is a chance that my first change cleans up the only opportunity to clear the futures without any change in the latest counter vs client counters, but I'm not 100% confident that is the case. I'm open to suggestions on a test for this. One option would be to make resolveWaitingFutures package private and annotated visible for testing only, but I don't really like that pattern\r\n\r\n####  Current Root Cause Analysis (guess)\r\n\r\nAs of now this is still a guess, but I think the root cause of this state where we reset a valid up to date counter is coming from a race-like condition that occurs when a server is processing multiple changes in close proximity.\r\n\r\nClient A:  ask Server 1 for changes with Counter.counter = 1 Counter.hash = A. becomes a waitingFuture on Server 1.\r\nServer 1: addChangeRequest(Change X). Counter.counter = 2. Counter.hash = B\r\nServer 1:execute resolveWaitingFutures for Change X(single threaded executor)\r\nServer 1: addChangeRequest(Change Y). Counter.counter = 3. Counter.hash = C\r\nServer 1: return Counter.counter = 3. Counter.hash = C\r\nClient A: ask Server 1 for changes with Counter.counter = 3. Counter.hash = C. becomes a waitingFuture on Server 1.\r\nServer 1 execute resolveWaitingFutures for Change Y.\r\nServer 1: reset counter for client A because Counter.counter = 3 from client is >= Counter.counter = 3 on server.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\n#### Put the requests right back into waitingFutures instead of returning empty response\r\n\r\nIn `ChangeRequestHistory#resolveWaitingFutures`, we could check the counters on waitingFuturesCopy before processing them, and if the counters match, add the item back onto waitingFutures.\r\n\r\n##### Pros\r\n\r\nNo wasted return with empty list of changes for client to process.\r\n\r\n##### Cons\r\n\r\nAdding some complexity and responsibility to `resolveWaitingFutures`\r\n\r\n#### resolveWaitingFutures with a point in time counter for all waitingFutures\r\n\r\nRefactor `ChangeRequestHistory#resolveWaitingFutures` and `ChangeRequestHistory#getRequestsSinceWithoutWait` to accept a `ChangeRequestHistory.Counter` object that is the counter we are using as the \"latest\" change that we will return to the client. This would prevent waitingFutures from \"seeing\" changes that came after `resolveWaitingFutures` gets called, but before they are actually resolved.\r\n\r\n##### Pros\r\n\r\nThis prevents a funky race-like condition where changes that happen after `resolveWaitingFutures` is called appear to be sneaking into the change set returned to client. And I think it is this condition that is what is the underlying cause of the state where we have waitingFutures being processed despite having an up to date counter.\r\n\r\n##### Cons\r\n\r\nYou are always going to process only one change at a time when you are a waitingFuture, even if there are multiple changes coming in close proximity, which I feel is often the case in many environments!\r\n\r\n### Some thoughts\r\n\r\nI feel that it is very common that a single segments-serving instance will process multiple changes in rapid succession. As of now, we are triggering processing of waitingFutures for every change. This can result in rapid client:server interactions between all of the clients maintaining a serverview and the server experiencing the change. From what I've observed in my own test env with some extra debug logs added to ChangeRequestHistory, we end up going through multiple cycles of change request deltas within a single second even. I wonder if this is the best pattern or if we could bake in some batching of change somehow that may result in some added latency for a serverview seeing change, but cut down on the rapid traffic. At the end of the day, perhaps i'm overthinking this. But I wanted to record my thoughts while they are fresh.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects.

ClusterByStatisticsCollectorImpl uses number of keys retained as a metric to check when to downsample a bucket. The size of keys is not necessarily the best metric, if the size of keys is small, more than the threshold could fit in memory. If the size is very large, it could lead to out of memory issues. This could be improved by changing this to check for the number of bytes currently retained instead. This would let us avoid downsampling if the keys are small, which would result in better accuracy for key collector.\r\nThe K value (which determines accuracy) for Quantile sketches which are used by KeyCollectors is set at 4096, which potentially could be higher, since we can downsample (which reduces the K). This has also been increased to 32768 for greater accuracy (at the cost of more memory).\r\n\r\n##### Changes\r\n\r\n  - Update ClusterByStatisticsCollector to store average bytes for a key.\r\n- Update ClusterByStatisticsCollector to use bytes as thresolds for downsampling.\r\n- Increased initial K value for quantile sketches from 4096 to 32768.\r\n\r\n### Memory Usage\r\n\r\nCurrently, the threshold for keys per ClusterByStatisticsCollector is 65,536. Once all sketches have a combined total of this threshold, sketches are downsampled till the total keys retained is halved. The new byte threshold for ClusterByStatisticsCollector is 300MB. For keys of average length 300 (which is around one time column and 8 string columns of 30 characters each), we would have 300MB/300 or 1,000,000 keys.\r\n\r\nFor quantiles sketches, the K has been increased to 32768, which comes around to 11 * 32,768 or 360,448 keys. Considering a key as 300 bytes again, this comes out to 108MB.\r\n\r\nFor DistinctKeyCollectors, the initial byte threshold before downsampling is 100MB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nThis PR makes expression exceptions more consistent by introducing `ExpressionValidationException` and `ExpressionProcessingException`, along with a new `NamedFunction` base interface to be shared between `Function`, `ApplyFunction`, and `ExprMacro`, which defines several helper validation methods to produce these new exceptions to help reduce the chance for inconsistencies in in exception validation error messages.\r\n\r\nThis fixes several issues around missing or vague error messages, such as the sampler API, caused by the use of `Preconditions` without error messages and error messages which did not include the function name.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of names, I've also adjusted `ExpressionTransform` to catch and wrap expression evaluation exceptions so that it can include information about which transform is causing the problem:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"640\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-09-06 at 7 51 32 PM\"

Memory.map is not Java 17 compatible, and from discussions\r\nwith the team, is challenging to make compatible with 17 while also\r\nretaining compatibility with 8 and 11. So, in this patch, we switch away\r\nfrom Memory.map and instead use the builtin JDK mmap functionality. Since\r\nit only supports maps up to Integer.MAX_VALUE, we also implement windowed\r\nmmaps in FrameFile, such that we can still handle large files.\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n\r\n1) Add two new \"map\" functions to FileUtils, which we use in this patch.\r\n2) Add a footer checksum to the FrameFile format. Individual frames\r\n   already have checksums, but the footer was missing one. Not directly\r\n   related, but I thought of it since I was modifying the code that reads\r\n   footers.\r\n\r\nUnit tests use an artificially lower `maxMmapSize`, since I didn't think it was\r\ngoing to be feasible to test with real 2GB+ files in unit tests.\r\n\r\nThis work is towards #12838.","created_at":"2022-08-27T06:21:03Z","updated_at":"2022-09-23T19:22:29Z","closed_at":"2022-08-30T18:13:48Z","merged_at":"2022-08-30T18:13:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"2450b96ac80f6881a2b57cd3e0f116da860cb022","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":606691557,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MDY2OTE1NTc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Compatibility","name":"Compatibility","color":"c5def5","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

Description\r\nThis PR adds SQL and native JSON function support for using negative array indexes in jsonpath expressions, e.g. `json_value(nested, '$.x[-2]')` will return the 2nd to last element of the array. This fixes a bug where using negative array indexes would cause an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` to be thrown, failing the query.\r\n\r\nSince the underlying column does not currently provide an optimal way to select the values, using negative array indexes with `JSON_VALUE` will \"fall back\" to processing the \"raw\" JSON data, similar to when using `JSON_QUERY`. Additionally, using negative array indexes will make the query not eligible for vectorization. I save both of these optimizations for a future PR or two.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-25T11:51:23Z","updated_at":"2022-08-27T01:24:43Z","closed_at":"2022-08-26T00:11:28Z","merged_at":"2022-08-26T00:11:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"72aba00e0991f301e12db77055cd43ffd2f85fe1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area - SQL","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Description\r\nThis PR makes some improvements to `JSON_VALUE` behavior, which fixes some bugs and inconsistency in behavior between the nested-field virtual column and the native `json_value` expression.\r\n\r\nThe first change is that the native `json_value` expression now has optional 3rd argument to specify type, which will cast all values to the specified type. This brings its behavior inline with `NestedFieldVirtualColumn`, whose selectors will cast values to the type specified by `expectedType`, regardless of the type of the underlying literal.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to wire this up, I realized how strangely I had `JSON_VALUE` wired up in the SQL layer. Prior to this PR, `JsonValueOperatorConversion` was wired up in the operator table as `JSON_VALUE`, and `JsonValueAnyOperatorConversion` was added as an alias to define an undocumented `JSON_VALUE_ANY` function (which is still undocumented, it doesn't really seem intended for direct use). The `JSON_VALUE_ANY` is there because the `StandardConvertletTable` has a rule that translates `JSON_VALUE(... RETURNING type)` into `CAST(JSON_VALUE_ANY(...) AS type)`. In effect, `JsonValueOperatorConversion` was only used indirectly via `JsonValueAnyOperatorConversion` via the convertlet, since it would be translated prior to translating to native query components.\r\n\r\nThis standard convertlet behavior isn't super useful because it means our operator conversion loses the type of the 'returning' which is now part of the outer cast, making it difficult to actually use the new type argument for the native expression.\r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from the standard convertlet table behavior, I've added `DruidJsonValueConvertletFactory` to do this conversion ourselves, but more appropriate for our needs. This convertlet checks the type of the `RETURNING` argument, if present, and uses new internal operators to handle type specific casts, `JsonValueBigintOperatorConversion`, `JsonValueDoubleOperatorConversion`, and `JsonValueVarcharOperatorConversion`, and changes `JsonValueAnyOperatorConversion` into a real conversion, taking the place of `JsonValueOperatorConversion` which is now removed because it is now handled by the convertlet. These internal functions will all remain undocumented for now at least.\r\n\r\nI also removed two undocumented native functions, `list_keys` and `list_paths`, which were added super early in the prototyping phase, that were basically the same as `json_keys` and `json_paths` except they spit out 'jq' syntax.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

PR refactors the Calcite test framework to allow use in a wider range of use cases than it possible today. Note that this PR *does not* include the new test framework. That will come later to keep the PRs of reasonable size.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWe have long used the \"Calcite tests\" framework as our primary way to test the SQL query stack. It works well within the constraints it imposes. As we move into new areas, those constraints become an issue. This PR takes a big step in the direction of loosening the existing constraints.\r\n\r\nAll test state is defined in a set of static variables. This means all tests have to agree on the shape and creation of those variables. As we test new things, test developers have to figure out how to shoe-horn their specific requirements into a structure shared by all tests. This gets harder and harder as the number of test grow. The solution is to more clearly isolate each test's setup from other tests.\r\n\r\nThe Calcite tests use a complex network of manually-created ad-hoc objects to build up the test framework. But, production code uses Guice. This creates two entirely different ways to construct the same kinds of infrastructure, making it far harder to create, debug and understand tests. Guice itself is hard enough to follow, but having to understand the second, ad-hoc system adds to the woes. Especially since the second system is based on static (i.e. global) variables. As a first step, we gather all the ad-hoc items into a single builder. A later, second, step can figure out how to create those objects using Guice.\r\n\r\nThe Calcite tests primarily validate the query output and native query. While there is a relatively easy way to validate the output, validating the native query requires building up a complex set of objects to describe the query. There are times when that is the best approach. Other times, we can get the same result in an easier way simply by providing the native query in text form. It is also easier to compare the \"expected\" and \"actual\" native queries if we can do a diff on formatted JSON. This PR factors out the test \"guts\" from the test setup so that the setup can either be in Java (as today) or from a test file (as proposed.)\r\n\r\nThe Catalog project will modify query plans based on the content of the catalog. This requires the ability to configure the catalog as part of test setup, when we need it, and to leave it out for tests that are unaware of the catalog. The catalog affects the query logical plan, and the query output schema. But, the current Calcite query tests have no way to capture or compare these factors. This limitation lead to the idea of the  [planner test framework](https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12545). That framework provides more flexibility than we have today to customize the Planner and other aspects of the test setup. This PR ensures that the catalog tests can use an (extended version of) the same test structure as the Calcite tests.\r\n\r\nThe original planner framework PR used a copy/paste approach to create a new `PlannerFixture` to allow building those components. This PR takes a \"DRY\" approach: rather than create a new copy, let's instead refactor the one we have so it can do the job for both the Calcite tests and the planner test framework.\r\n\r\n## Goals\r\n\r\nWe wish to use the Calcite test framework in several additional use cases:\r\n\r\n* Use the tests in ITs against a (small) Druid cluster.\r\n* Validate the query output schema, logical plan and other planner artifacts.\r\n* Allow tests to be defined in text files.\r\n* When Druid is able to run a Broker and Historical in a single process, we wish to use these tests in that context as well: same tests, entirely different query stack underneath.\r\n* We wish to apply the MSQ ideas to the interactive path. We want to reuse the existing tests with this path which would, again, have a different query infrastructure underneath the tests.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n\r\nThe above suggests an approach to evolve the tests:\r\n\r\n* Separate the query stack from test creation. Allow a test to run against multiple query stacks.\r\n* Encapsulate query test creation in a \"builder\", so that the same builder can be used by both the \"traditional\" and proposed file-based tests.\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n* Move the current ad-hoc query stack creation out of the Calcite test classes into a new \"builder\". The builder is responsible for providing a planner factory that the tests use.\r\n* Encapsulate the query test logic in a \"test builder\". The test builder can be used by the file-based tests as well as the \"traditional\" tests.\r\n\r\nThis then sets us up for future moves:\r\n\r\n* Evolve the ad-hoc query framework builder to use Guice to create its objects.\r\n* Allow greater control of the framework so that, say, a single test can run in \"SQL compatible nulls\" and \"use defaults\" modes in the same test run.\r\n* Provide multiple implementations of the framework builder that can use a \"single-server\", IT or \"operator-based\" setup.\r\n* Use the same test builder for the file-based planner tests, perhaps with options to compare additional items such as the output schema, logical plan, etc.\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\nBefore this PR, `CalciteTests` was a \"kitchen sink\" one-stop-shop to create the test data, conglomerates, segment walkers, planner factory, etc. Tough we create all the components per-test, they all depend on a static injector used for the entire class. Then, `BaseCalciteQueryTest` provides tools to customize: methods that can be overridden to customize the operator table, macro table, etc. Then, there was a large set of test-related methods.\r\n\r\nThe gist of this PR is to refactor the code into a set of builders, with the `CalciteTests` referencing those builders, rather than holding all the code. The result is that the components can now be reused in other contexts. And, the same tests can run in different ways, just by changing the test infrastructure setup.\r\n\r\n### Query Infrastructure\r\n\r\nThe Calcite tests use a \"query infrastructure\" build up in a Guice injector and static variables across `CalciteTests` and `BaseCalciteQueryTest`. That code moves into a new `QueryFramework` and an associated `Builder` class. This class will eventually use Guice to build objects, and can create the query stack differently for the scenarios mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe `QueryFramework` controls its own state and does not depend on shared static variables. This ensures that the builder can be used in the new framework as well as in the \"classic\" \"Calcite test\" framework.\r\n\r\nThe `QueryFramework` uses a `QueryComponentSupplier` is a backward compatibility shim to call existing test code builder methods that already exist in test classes. When used stand-alone (as in the file-based tests), the test would provide its own implementation of this shim to customize the query framework as needed.\r\n\r\nhe Calcite tests use a set of in-memory segments. The code for creating this data moves from `CalciteTests` into a new `TestDataBuilder`. When tests run in an IT, this builder does nothing since we'd have to populate the data ahead of time.\r\n\r\n#### Two Phases of Infrastructure Construction\r\n\r\nThe refactoring breaks the \"framework\" components into two phases. The first creates the sample data, conglomerate and walker which are constant across tests. `BaseCalciteQueryTest` is modified to build this phase once per class (rather than once per test method as before.) This is the piece that would ideally eventually use Guice (but does not yet do so.)\r\n\r\nThe second phase builds the planner factory and associated objects per test. The driver here is `PlannerConfig` which several tests customize: anything that depends on `PlannerConfig` must be rebuilt including the root schema (which contains views which depends on the planner), the planner factory, and the \"statement\" factory (which uses the planner factory).\r\n\r\n#### Infrastructure Builders\r\n\r\nThe planer tests want to run tests differently than the classic \"Calcite query test\" approach. To do that, we refactor framework creation into a series of builders which are independent of the `CalciteTests`/`BaseCalciteQueryTest` classes (but can be used by them.) Specifically, each of which accepts the injector to use rather than being hard-coded to use `CalciteTest.INJECTOR`.\r\n\r\n* `QueryFrameworkUtils` contains many of the low-level functions that build framework items. Each method accepts an injector. The `CalciteTests` versions still exist, but now just call the `QueryFrameworkUtils` versions with the `CalciteTests.INJECTOR`.\r\n* `QueryFramework` builds the entire framework, including conglomerate, walker, schema, planner factory, etc. To ensure backward compatibility, this class takes an interface, `QueryComponentSupplier` that has method names that match the existing `BaseCalciteQueryTest` methods so that tests need not change.\r\n* `TestDataBuilder` builds the test data. There is a large amount of code to build the segments, accessed by a single method. By pulling the code out into this class, it is easier to understand the remainder of `CalciteTests`, and to understand which method exist only to build the sample data.\r\n\r\nThe `QueryFramework` is built per test class, and offers a `statementFactory()` method to build the per-test components. Objects that used to be fields of `BaseCalciteQueryTest` are now obtained from the framework instance.\r\n\r\n### Query Test Builder and Runner\r\n\r\nThe various `testQuery()` methods now populate a `QueryTestBuilder` class, which then launches a `QueryTestRunner` to perform the actual tests. The file-based tests will use a variation of this same builder and runner. The test builder is similar to the `IngestTester` created for the MSQ tests, but with support for all the things that the Calcite tests use.\r\n\r\nIt was the case that \"all roads lead\" to a single \"uber\" `testQuery()` method. Now, all roads lead to the query test builder, and from there to the test runner.\r\n\r\nThe `QueryTestRunner` divides up the surprisingly large number of test tasks into modular chunks. A set of \"exec\" tasks either run or prepare a query. Both capture results. Then, a set of verify tasks check the actual results against the expected results.\r\n\r\nAfter a glance at the code, it should be obvious how the same builder can be used for the proposed file-based tests: we simply populate the builder with items from a file, rather than from a Java method.\r\n\r\nFuture tests have the option of using the builder directly, rather than creating the typical ungainly set of arguments to a `testQuery()` method. In fact, all the `testQuery()` methods do now is turn around and populate the builder.\r\n\r\n### Split `PlannerConfig`\r\n\r\nIt turns out that `PlannerConfig` holds properties used by the planner (as suggested by the name) _and_ for the Broker's segment metadata cache. Since `PlannerConfig` may change per test, we had to rebuild the segment cache per test.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, `PlannerConfig` is split into two, with the segment cache values (only two) moving to a new `SegmentCacheMetadataConfig ` class. Both use the same base property, so there should be no change to behavior from the user's perspective. Since no test every changed the segment metadata config, we do not need to rebuild the segment metadata cache per test method.\r\n\r\n## The Road Not Taken\r\n\r\nThe above refactoring still uses the \"do-it-yourself\" approach to assembling the many objects within the framework. A longer-term goal would be to rely on Guice to build these objects so that we run tests closer to the way we run the actual Druid server (and as a step toward a single-process Druid.) As it turns out, there are many additional issues to address to take this additional step, and those are left as a future exercise. This PR moves us toward that goal, however, by putting the construction of the framework behind a single builder class.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nMost of the code in this PR affects only tests. As a result, the Calcite query tests themselves are comprehensive tests of the above changes.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n\r\n- [X] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [X] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods. Linked related entities via Javadoc links.\r\n- [X] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-24T22:46:44Z","updated_at":"2022-11-22T07:15:11Z","closed_at":"2022-10-20T22:45:44Z","merged_at":"2022-10-20T22:45:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"86e6e61e884230e7a82e726f5f5c33602b242caf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":303259531,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMDMyNTk1MzE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Testing","name":"Area

I have no servers. Not assigning anything...\"\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe docker-compose.yml file uses hardcoded 'conf/druid/single-server' configurations. \r\nThis results in OOM killed broker as described in [Issue#10331](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/10331). \r\n\r\nThe suggestion was:\r\n> Maybe we should update the docker-compose settings to use either the \"nano\" or \"micro\" settings from https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/single-server.html. (Or have two docker-compose config bundles, one for \"nano\" and one for \"micro\".) That would probably help. A PR to do that would be great.\r\n\r\nThis was the goal of this PR.\r\n\r\nThe change was to include a new env var **DRUID_SINGLE_NODE_CONF** that takes a value from the list:\r\n- large \r\n- medium\r\n- micro-quickstart\r\n- nano-quickstart \r\n- small\r\n- xlarge\r\n\r\nThis would get injected into the container via docker-compose env vars.\r\nSince I use this on my Mac M1, I have modified environment file to specify 'DRUID_SINGLE_NODE_CONF=micro-quickstart' .\r\n\r\nAn example modified environment file is part of this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug \r\nSince docker-compose files are typically for local development it made sense to use the smaller memory profiles. \r\n\r\nI also create a multi-arch Docker image with buildx for my Mac M1 with support for:\r\n- linux/amd64\r\n- linux/arm64\r\n\r\nThis can be provided if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `druid.sh` new shell functions for conf path resolution\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added comments explaining the \"why\" and the intent of the code wherever would not be obvious for an unfamiliar reader.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-24T20:52:29Z","updated_at":"2022-08-29T12:16:38Z","closed_at":"2022-08-29T12:13:53Z","merged_at":"2022-08-29T12:13:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"9fd8ab3c750c57dae3a6cf2608b9ee3e83e2614f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2569056535,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNTY5MDU2NTM1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Docker","name":"Docker","color":"1d76db","default":false,"description":"https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/druid"}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

Misc changes\r\n - We include the resource info in the error message that the user is trying to access. A query can touch many resources at the same time - table, context parameters, etc. it will be useful to fix the query if user knows precisely what they are not allowed to.  \r\n - If the task completes with zero rows, we now treat it as an ingestion failure. Its almost always a result of misconfiguration and results in confusion. \r\n - If time could not be parsed for any row, we get zero intervals in reports. For that too, we return a task fail result with an actionable error message. \r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\nFixes #12063.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Description\r\nAdds additional limits `maxBytesInMemory` and `maxClientResponseBytes` to the Druid sampler API config, to augment existing options of `numRows` and `timeoutMs`. While these two configs are quite similar, `maxBytesInMemory` is oriented around controlling how big the `IncrementalIndex` which performs the sampling will be, while `maxClientResponseBytes` is an attempt to allow clients to specify the maximum size of response they would prefer to handle, which might vary significantly from `maxBytesInMemory`.\r\n\r\n`maxClientResponseBytes` is done in a rather sad way of serializing (and throwing away) the sampler rows and counting the bytes. In the future we might want to rework the sampler API to be a streaming API and do the counting of this stuff and enforcement of limits a bit more naturally.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

user might construct a timeseries query on inline data by mistake which contains no filters on time intervals (hence the query is on ETERNITY interval) and also specifies a non-ALL granularity. Currently, those queries will start generating a large number of time grains while generating the results which can lead to a very high chance for heap OOM or a very very long query runtime.\r\nThis change disallows such queries from execution to avoid the problems mentioned above. Semantically as well, there is less point in running a time granularity query over the ETERNITY interval.\r\n\r\nAn augmentation to the solution could be to find the time-interval of the inline data by traversing it and then using that interval in the `RowBasedStorageAdapater`. But doing that change today will either require recompuation of inline data or eager materialization of it in the adapater, both of which approaches have their own short-comings. So, for now this change is refrained - it can be considered in future if needed.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Thanks for trying to help us make Apache Druid be the best it can be! Please fill out as much of the following information as is possible (where relevant, and remove it when irrelevant) to help make the intention and scope of this PR clear in order to ease review. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the doc for contribution (https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before making this PR. Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThere is a race condition that happens when we stream reports/logs from the tasks. The race happens when\r\n tasks are finishing.\r\n While finishing, the task sends the log/report to deep storage but is still running with HTTP chat handlers unregistered.\r\nThis results in all streaming log/report request to that task to report a 500 if its still running but the http chat handlers are deregistered.\r\n\r\n In such a case, catch and ignore the 1st IOException and try deepStorage for the log. If the log is still not found, return the caught exception.\r\n \r\n \r\nThe cleaner fix would be to add a new state like `finishing` to the task status which seemed like an overkill for such a change. \r\n\r\nWe needed to change the interface as we want the inputstream to open eagerly so that we can get the exception in \"SwitchingTaskLog streamer\" and not open the input stream twice for doing such a check.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe the goal of this PR, what problem are you fixing. If there is a corresponding issue (referenced above), it's not necessary to repeat the description here, however, you may choose to keep one summary sentence. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe your patch: what did you change in code? How did you fix the problem? -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there are several relatively logically separate changes in this PR, create a mini-section for each of them. For example: -->\r\n\r\n#### Fixed the bug \r\n\r\n<!--\r\nIn each section, please describe design decisions made, including:\r\n - Choice of algorithms\r\n - Behavioral aspects. What configuration values are acceptable? How are corner cases and error conditions handled, such as when there are insufficient resources?\r\n - Class organization and design (how the logic is split between classes, inheritance, composition, design patterns)\r\n - Method organization and design (how the logic is split between methods, parameters and return types)\r\n - Naming (class, method, API, configuration, HTTP endpoint, names of emitted metrics)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- It's good to describe an alternative design (or mention an alternative name) for every design (or naming) decision point and compare the alternatives with the designs that you've implemented (or the names you've chosen) to highlight the advantages of the chosen designs and names. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there was a discussion of the design of the feature implemented in this PR elsewhere (e. g. a \"Proposal\" issue, any other issue, or a thread in the development mailing list), link to that discussion from this PR description and explain what have changed in your final design compared to your original proposal or the consensus version in the end of the discussion. If something hasn't changed since the original discussion, you can omit a detailed discussion of those aspects of the design here, perhaps apart from brief mentioning for the sake of readability of this PR description. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some of the aspects mentioned above may be omitted for simple and small changes. -->\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n##### Key changed/added classes in this PR\r\n * `TaskLogStreamer`\r\n * `SwitchingTaskLogStreamer`\r\n * `CLIOverlord`\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<!-- Check the items by putting \"x\" in the brackets for the done things.

Also, once you open a PR, please _avoid using force pushes and rebasing_ since these make it difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. See [the 'If your pull request shows conflicts with master' section](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#if-your-pull-request-shows-conflicts-with-master) for more details. -->\r\n\r\nFixes #XXXX.\r\n\r\n<!-- Replace XXXX with the id of the issue fixed in this PR.

a cluster with non `allow-all` authentication configured, JDBC queries log the following misleading message : `Can not find Authenticator with Name [allowAll]`. It is misleading since we use `allow-all` authentication for JDBC queries to bypass the authentication on router itself. JDBC queries are authenticated on broker.\r\nThe log comes because having an `authenticatedBy` field in the bypass auth result leads the query to a codepath where the authenticator object is tried to be fetched. But since we haven't configured `allow-all` auth, the error log comes.\r\nThis change removes the `authenticatedBy` field in `AuthenticationResult` for bypass requests to avoid the misleading logging.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [ ] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [ ] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

`sqlQuery/planningTimeMs` metric per SQL query which computes the time it takes to build a native query from the SQL query.\r\nWhile comparing the perf of native to SQL API for the same query, users tend to check the extra time taken by planning stage of the SQL. Currently, that time is estimated as the difference between running the SQL and then running the native query using EXPLAIN. To find the exact difference, the `query/time` metrics of both SQL and native queries are compared.\r\nFurther, for SQL query workloads there is no easy visiblity into the holistic planning time.\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n   - [ ] using the [concurrency checklist](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/concurrency.md) (Remove this item if the PR doesn't have any relation to concurrency.)\r\n- [x] added documentation for new or modified features or behaviors.\r\n- [x] added Javadocs for most classes and all non-trivial methods.

Description\r\nThis PR adjusts the behavior of `PARSE_JSON` to be strict and a bit more intuitive, adds a new `TRY_PARSE_JSON` which will produce `NULL` values instead of errors for bad or non-string inputs, and removes `TO_JSON` which no longer had a use since its behavior has been made intrinsic to all JSON expressions.\r\n\r\nPreviously `PARSE_JSON` was far far too forgiving, allowing stuff like `PARSE_JSON('hello world')` to pass through into a string root literal even though it isn't valid JSON. Meanwhile, something like `PARSE_JSON('{')` would be an error. Basically, the behavior was `TO_JSON` if the input was not actually JSON, which is far too magical and not particularly useful (apologies this made it in like this, it was a relic of an earlier iteration).\r\n\r\nNow, `PARSE_JSON` is strict and will fail with an error if provided non-string input (with the exception of null, which will output a null) or if the string contains invalid JSON. `TRY_PARSE_JSON` has also been added, which will return `NULL` for anything that is not a string containing valid JSON in the cases where `PARSE_JSON` would have resulted in an error.\r\n\r\nI made some adjustments to `StructuredDataProcessor` to look for and 'unwrap' any `StructuredData` objects it happens to encounter, which would allow for the JSON expressions which produce `COMPLEX<json>` outputs to return them as `StructuredData`, but have not actually made this change to the expressions at this time. This change should be harmless, but isn't currently necessary so I can revert it if any reviewers wish.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nThis PR has:\r\n- [x] been self-reviewed.\r\n- [x] added unit tests or modified existing tests to cover new code paths, ensuring the threshold for [code coverage](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/dev/code-review/code-coverage.md) is met.\r\n- [x] been tested in a test Druid cluster.\r\n","created_at":"2022-08-18T11:29:14Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:07:35Z","closed_at":"2022-08-23T01:41:08Z","merged_at":"2022-08-23T01:41:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"289e43281eeec2742a2d5a60ad166a29ad4f6803","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":219585748,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODU3NDg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Querying","name":"Area - Querying","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null},{"id":690563172,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2OTA1NjMxNzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20SQL","name":"Area - SQL","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.

you ever use the web console? Well, be prepared to have your experience elevated!\r\n\r\nThis PR adds functionality to the web console primarily driven by the desire to support the [Multi-stage distributed queries](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12262) effort with an appropriate GUI. This PR needs https://github.com/apache/druid/pull/12918 to work and will not pass CI until #12918 is merged.\r\n\r\n> Please note: The example data is hosted on [static.imply.io](http://static.imply.io/). Storage space and bandwidth on this server is being donated by Imply as a service to the community. I thought about using [druid.apache.org](http://druid.apache.org/) instead, but that didn't seem like a good place to host larger data files, since the server is designed for website content.\r\n\r\nHere are the high level bits.\r\n\r\n## New query view (WorkbenchView) with tabs and long running query support\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1605\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185309077-8840ff85-19a9-4fc0-8398-4f2446ff29b3.png\">\r\n\r\nThe new query lets you execute [multi-stage, task based, queries](https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12262) via the `/druid/v2/sql/task` and `/druid/indexer/v1/task/*` APIs as well as native and sql-native queries just like the old Query view. A key point of the sql-msq-task based queries is that they may run for a long time. This inspired / necessitated many UX changes including (but not limited to):\r\n\r\n### Tabs\r\n\r\nYou can now have many queries stored and running at the same time. In my opinion tabs are a UX game changer\r\n\r\n<img width=\"792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185309114-fe82cccd-a917-415c-a394-a3485403226d.png\">\r\n\r\nYou can, open many tabs, duplicate them, and copy them as text to be pasted into any console and reopened there.\r\n\r\n### Progress reports (counter reports)\r\n\r\nsql-msq-task queries have detailed progress reports and these can be visualized using the summary progress bar, or the in detail execution table that provides summaries of the counters for every step.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1065\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185309244-cba3d640-c48a-49bd-8c72-ed3e842b0cb2.png\">\r\n\r\n### Error and warning reports\r\n\r\nsql-msq-task queries go out of their way to present user friendly warnings and errors should anything go wrong.\r\nThe new query view has components to visualize these with their full detail including a stack-trace.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"727\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185309488-421e7410-251d-4590-88f1-92fb23f4be13.png\">\r\n\r\n### Recent query panel\r\n\r\nSince sql-msq-task queries are tasks is it possible to show queries that are executing currently and that have executed in the recent past.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"507\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185309579-e2ce021c-6bf6-4576-bdee-ff552e1c4c3b.png\">\r\n\r\nFor any query in this panel you can view the execution details for it and you can also attach it as a new tab and continue iterating on the query. It is also possible to download the \"query detail archive\" which is a JSON file containing all the important details for a given query that can be easily shared for troubleshooting.\r\n\r\n### Connect external data flow\r\n\r\nRunning SQL-based ingestion queries is all well and good once you have the query, but where do queries come from?\r\n\r\nThe `Connect external data` flow lets you use the sampler to sample your data, determine its schema, and generate a fully formed SQL query that you can edit to your hearts content before clicking `Run`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1265\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185309631-5ceed7d0-2bb2-43b9-83ed-fdcad4a152be.png\">\r\n\r\nThis point-and-click flow will save you a bunch of typing.\r\n\r\n### Preview button\r\n\r\nThe `Preview` button appears when you type in an INSERT or REPLACE SQL query.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"268\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185309669-e262d0fc-cdd3-4ae2-a249-f60fefab38ba.png\">\r\n\r\nWhen clicked it removes the INSERT or REPLACE clause and executes your query as an \"inline\" query (with a limit). This lets you get a sense of how your data will be shaped after all the transformations that you coded into the SQL query have been applied.\r\n\r\n### Results table\r\n\r\nThe query results table has been improved in style and function.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"467\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185309870-50d9a142-495e-498b-981b-3f782da03e29.png\">\r\n\r\nIt now shows you type icons for the column types and supports the ability to manipulate nested columns with ease.\r\n\r\n### Helper queries\r\n\r\nDo you like notebooks? Do you like [CTEs]()? Well now they have some UI affordances in the console.\r\nHelper queries are collapsable elements that hold a query that can be referenced from the main query just like they were defined with a WITH statement.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1230\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185309989-68688bbe-d440-4848-baf6-c67d5f528a1c.png\">\r\n\r\nThe idea is that if you are composing a complicated query it is nice to be able to break it down into queries and be able to preview each part on its own.\r\n\r\n### Misc tools\r\n\r\nAlong with these features there are also miscellaneous tools available from the `...` menu.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"872\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185310070-856956ca-daab-415a-a694-ec72eede2b47.png\">\r\n\r\nAlong these you will find:\r\n\r\n- Explain query - show the query plan for a sql-native and sql-msq-task query.\r\n- Convert ingestion spec to SQL - Helps you migrate your native batch and hadoop based specs to the SQL-based format.\r\n- Open query detail archive - lets you open a query detail archive downloaded earlier.\r\n- Load demo queries - lets you load a set of pre-made queries to play around with sql-msq-task functionality.\r\n\r\n## New SQL-based data loader\r\n\r\nThe data loader exists as a GUI wizard to help users craft a JSON ingestion spec using point and click and quick previews.\r\nThe SQL data loader is the SQL-based ingestion analog of that.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1754\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185310358-8d4421b0-4429-4ddf-86e1-825bf570e50f.png\">\r\n\r\nJust like the native based data loader that serves as its inspiration, all the state is stored in the actual SQL query and at any moment the user can opt to manipulate the query directly.\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between the SQL-based data loader and the \"Connect external data\" flow? They start off exactly the same, they figure out the source and format to use and generate the external. After the external has been defined the \"Connect external data\" flow generates a seed query that you can then edit as you wish. The key point is that (unless you just want to ingest with the seed query) you must edit a rather complex SQL statement and preview it using the \"Preview\" functionality that is not sub-second (it reached out to the data for every preview). On the other hand the data loader let's you manipulate the (SQL) ingestion spec completely with point-and-click it also samples the data and lets you preview it using sql-native making the previews sub-second. The SQL data loader limits you to what kind of query you can write, for example you can not currently use it to express a query involving a JOIN, but at any point in time it lets you take your query to the regular query view so there is no need to worry about being restricted.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"476\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185310417-fa7d3c9d-8013-407d-bfea-66361541b508.png\">\r\n\r\nSince the SQL-based data loader is batch only and the existing data loader is for streaming (supervisors) and batch data (tasks). The existing data loader has been split up into its streaming and batch components to make the comparison clearer.\r\n\r\n## Misc other changes\r\n\r\nSince the MSQ part is so transformative it drove other parts of the console development as well.\r\n\r\n### Header rearrangment\r\n\r\nNow that the query view has tabs and can do ingestion and data manipulation it is about time it took the helm as the most important view in the header.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1040\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185310493-94513a22-fe2f-4849-ad9d-ea3d80218783.png\">\r\n\r\nThere is now also a more `...` button that can host all the views not important enough to be top level.\r\n\r\n### Data preview for both the Datasource and Segment detail modals\r\n\r\nYou can now click on a datasource or segment to see a preview of the data within.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1751\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185310616-9c118136-3882-4009-9f94-ae43e5772c59.png\">\r\n\r\n### Task cancel status\r\n\r\nThe task table now explicitly shows if a task has been canceled in a different color than a failed task.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1196\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/185310767-0592578d-3e36-46d3-b686-6c13bddf9483.png\">\r\n\r\n### Other improvements\r\n\r\n- Expose the tuning config property `maxColumnsToMerge` for batch ingestion and compaction in the form UI\r\n- Fixed docs link URL\r\n- Better filtering on all data tables (Datasources, Ingestion, Services, etc)\r\n- Made filtering on modules work better in the Status dialog\r\n- Added the file `filter` property to all inputSources where it applies\r\n- Mixed some confusing labels in the UI\r\n- Future proof the `useQueryManager` hook to work with React18","created_at":"2022-08-18T06:38:57Z","updated_at":"2022-08-26T08:07:18Z","closed_at":"2022-08-24T23:17:12Z","merged_at":"2022-08-24T23:17:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"04ee7abeff7db86aca350a5daae8bf8cfa0da81f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1251906357,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUxOTA2MzU3","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Web%20Console","name":"Area - Web Console","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1253197998,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUzMTk3OTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Query%20UI","name":"Area - Query UI","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2717749995,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNzE3NzQ5OTk1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Ingestion","name":"Area - Ingestion","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4418928415,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAGEErM8AAAABB2N_Hw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20MSQ","name":"Area - MSQ","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":"For multi stage queries - https://github.com/apache/druid/issues/12262"}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/46","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/46/labels","id":8348738,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAGEErM4Af2RC","number":46,"title":"24.0.0","description":"Druid 24.0.0 release.
