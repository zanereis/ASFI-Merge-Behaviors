Do not use Netty threads for the entire request lifecycle. Each\r\n  instance of `ExecutionHandlerContext` (essentially each client\r\n  connection) uses a command queue which is actioned by a single thread\r\n  taken from the Geode 'waiting pool'.\r\n- Every `SUBSCRIBE`ed client is moved to a separate `EventGroupLoop` so that\r\n  `PUBLISH`ed messages are not sent back using the 'normal' Worker\r\n  `EventLoopGroup`. This avoids a deadlock issue where `PUBLISH`ed messages\r\n  need to be sent using the same thread that the `PUBLISH` response needs\r\n  to happen on.\r\n- Fix issues with PubSub where switching the `EventLoopGroup` may fail\r\n  (because a client has already closed the connection) thus resulting in\r\n  hanging `PUBLISH`ers waiting for a `Subscription` to be marked as\r\n  `readyForPublish`.\r\n- Consolidate various `MockSubscriber` classes\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, check Concourse for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible.

you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Does `gradlew build` run cleanly?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, check Concourse for build issues and\r\nsubmit an update to your PR as soon as possible. If you need help, please send an\r\nemail to dev@geode.apache.org.\r\n\r\nThis Draft PR tries to provide an alternative solution to the ones offered in RFC https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/GEODE/Avoid+the+queuing+of+dropped+events+by+the+primary+gateway+sender+when+the+gateway+sender+is+stopped.\r\n\r\nThe high level idea consists of instead of trying not to store dropped events in tmpDroppedEvents to later send batch removal messages when the primary gateway sender is not started. Instead try to send the batch removal message when the event to be dropped is received. That way, when the sender is stopped for a long time and there are events coming, the memory of the AbstractGatewaySender will not grow with entries in the tmpDroppedEvents member.\r\n\r\nIn order to send the batch removal message directly, the eventProcessor for the AbstractGatewaySender must have been created. If it is not yet created because the sender was created with manual start set to true, while receiving events to be dropped, they will be stored in tmpDroppedEvents as there is no other choice.

region with gw sender\r\n\r\nGeode behaves differently with respect to transactions when\r\ncreating a partitioned region with a parallel gateway sender to\r\nwhen first the partitioned region is created and then the\r\nparallel gateway sender is added by altering the region.\r\n\r\nIn the first case (create region with gateway sender), when\r\nsending a transaction for the region, an event is sent\r\nto each server hosting the bucket for the data in the transaction.\r\n\r\nIn the second case (create region + alter region),\r\nwhen sending a transaction for the region, an event\r\nis sent to every cache member and not only to those hosting\r\nthe bucket for the data in the transaction. This leads to,\r\nin the servers not hosting the bucket for the data,\r\nthat the events are stored in the\r\nbucketToTempQueueMap member variable of the\r\nParallelGatewaySenderQueue.\r\n\r\nThe behavior in the first case is the right one.\r\n\r\nThe wrong behavior is provoked by the setting to true of the\r\nrequiresNotification variable of the PartitionedRegion\r\nby the distributeUpdatedProfileOnSenderCreation method.\r\nThis method should only set this variable to true\r\nin case the sender is serial as it is done when\r\na partitioned region is initialized.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

the following unused methods:\r\n- `getRandomAvailableTCPPortRange(int)`\r\n- `getRandomAvailableTCPPorts(int,bool)`\r\n- `getRandomAvailableTCPPortRangeKeepers(int)`\r\n- `getRandomAvailableTCPPortRangeKeepers(int,bool)`\r\n\r\nRemoved two methods that used an ineffective, incorrect calculation to try to distribute ports evenly across VMs:\r\n\r\n- `getRandomAvailablePortForDUnitSite()`\r\n- `getRandomAvailableTCPPortsForDUnitSite()`\r\n\r\nThese methods attempted to distribute ports by using the VM id as a modulus. The intention was something like this (assuming 5 VMs):\r\n\r\nVM 1 would get ports 20001, 20006, 20011, 20016, ...\r\nVM 2 would get ports 20002, 20007, 20012, 20017, ...\r\nVM 3 would get ports 20003, 20008, 20013, 20018, ...\r\nVM 4 would get ports 20004, 20009, 20014, 20019, ...\r\nVM 5 would get ports 20000, 20005, 20010, 20015, ...\r\n\r\nBut the actual calculation distributed ports like this:\r\n\r\nVM 1: 20000, 20001, 20002, 20003, 20004, ...\r\nVM 2: 20000, 20002, 20004, 20006, 20008, ...\r\nVM 3: 20001, 20004, 20007, 20010, 20013, ...\r\nVM 4: 20000, 20004, 20008, 20012, 20016, ...\r\nVM 5: 20000, 20005, 20010, 20015, 20020, ...\r\n\r\n... with lots of potential port collisions from one VM to another.\r\n\r\nThe few uses of these methods were replaced by calls to existing methods `getRandomAvailableTCPPort()` and `getRandomAvailableTCPPorts()`, which offer a more reliable method of distributing ports.\r\n","created_at":"2020-08-21T21:54:12Z","updated_at":"2020-09-01T18:19:33Z","closed_at":"2020-09-01T18:18:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"95541bfc08405fbc86dc87477503b644814fd9f3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":true,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5471/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5471/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5471/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/0a4e1e94146595338902b2189eadf4ed61318f58","head":{"label":"demery-pivotal:wip/geode-8404/available-port-helper","ref":"wip/geode-8404/available-port-helper","sha":"0a4e1e94146595338902b2189eadf4ed61318f58","user":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":159222461,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTkyMjI0NjE=","name":"geode","full_name":"demery-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"demery-pivotal","id":45369324,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MzY5MzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45369324?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/demery-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/demery-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

used to work until recently.\r\n\r\nGeode releases were never impacted, but loss of this feature is a nuisance for developer builds that don't typically pass a product version, leading to unintuitive errors like `Cannot use a 0.0.0 gfsh client to connect to a 0.0.0 cluster`\r\n\r\nSerialization version is the safest way to check gfsh compatibility, since in general it is unwise to make assumptions about product version because it is not intrinsic to Geode.\r\n\r\nThis PR also codifies forward and backward compatibility to be based on serialization major version, i.e. gfsh 1.x will not promise future compatibility with Geode 2.x, but gfsh 2.x would presumably support backward compatibility with a 1.10 or later cluster (we can of course change this if Geode ever reaches 2.0 and we do decide to break backward compatibility)\r\n\r\nThis PR restores the serialization version check, which was lost during GEODE-8331.  However, serialization version was only exposed in Geode 1.12, and since we are now interoperable back to Geode 1.10, the product version range check remains a necessary fallback iff remote serialization version is unavailable.","created_at":"2020-08-18T05:05:52Z","updated_at":"2020-08-22T00:29:03Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T16:32:07Z","merged_at":"2020-08-21T16:32:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"9c31b21d1c23c52f1c047eed696d1db84390aa28","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/5462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/issues/5462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/statuses/478fc0ba7dc00c04ddc28d6a115ac7efefc88adc","head":{"label":"onichols-pivotal:GEODE-8435-restore-gfsh-connect-when-serialization-version-matches","ref":"GEODE-8435-restore-gfsh-connect-when-serialization-version-matches","sha":"478fc0ba7dc00c04ddc28d6a115ac7efefc88adc","user":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":114800905,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTQ4MDA5MDU=","name":"geode","full_name":"onichols-pivotal/geode","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onichols-pivotal","id":34043438,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0MDQzNDM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34043438?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onichols-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onichols-pivotal/geode","description":"Apache

is a draft PR to see if it fixes, without any undesired effect, the difference in behavior in Geode between creating a region with a gateway sender or creating a region without it and then altering the region to add the gateway sender. In the second case, when executing transactions on partitioned regions, all members in the region are notified and not only those that host the entries corresponding to the transaction. \r\nThe notification in the members who do not host entries for the transaction provokes that they try to queue the event in the gateway sender queue but as they do not host a bucket for the entry in the event, they are queued in ParallelGatewaySenderQueue.tempQueue. These events are removed from there when the event is sent by the primary gateway sender but if the remote site is stopped, these events stored in tempQueue could end up filling up the heap of the member.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

not enable `SO_REUSEADDR` when binding a socket to an ephemeral port.\r\n\r\nOn some operating systems, enabling `SO_REUSEADDR` when binding to an ephemeral port allows the system to chose a port in `TIME_WAIT` state. The version of Linux used in our CI is one such operating system.\r\n\r\nThis causes two problems:\r\n\r\n1. The system can bind to a port that is still waiting for data from a previous connection, including connections that have nothing to do with Geode.\r\n2. Much of our test code, and some of our production code, deliberately puts ports into `TIME_WAIT` state in order to \"reserve\" them for later use.

failed once in a while because it was using lettuce to communicate with the server and lettuce would automatically redo commands when a member departed instead of allow the test code to check to see if the command had already been done. This resulted in a duplicate append that caused the test's validation to fail. The test has now been changed to use \"jedis\" instead of \"lettuce\" which allows the test more control over what happens when a connection to the server is lost.\r\n\r\nThis pull request also changes the server to no longer throw to the client an exception containing \"memberDeparted\". Now it will instead drop the connection from the client. This will cause the client to think it needs to reconnect and deal with the operation being in doubt in a standard redis way instead of our own special \"memberDeparted\" message.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

restores the point at which we notify membership listeners of\r\ndepartures.  We used to do this (in 1.12 and earlier) when a ShutdownMessage\r\nis received instead of waiting for a new membership view announcing the departure.\r\nMembership views can take some time to form and install, which can cause\r\npersistent (disk store) views to be updated later than they used to be.\r\n\r\nIn the case of this ticket the disk store of one member was being\r\nclosed while another was shutting down.  The member closing its disk\r\nstore did not see the view announcing that shutdown until most of its\r\ndisk store regions had closed their persistence advisors.  This left the\r\ndisk store thinking that the other member was still up at the time it\r\nwas closed.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
