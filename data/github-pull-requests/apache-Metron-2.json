I ran through this plan and variations of it many times over as I went through testing.\r\n\r\nI want to get this in front of people to start reviewing asap. It's going to take me a couple days to work through a reasonable test plan for this, but this should not hold up reviewing the approach. Of note is that the change from HTableInterface to Table by HBase has now shifted the burden of connection management from the HTable implementation to the end user/client. We previously had very little, if any, hooks to close our HBase tables or attempt to clean up resources. In response to this change, there were a couple options for dealing with this:\r\n1. Completely rewrite our HBase client logic to fully manage connection lifecycle\r\n2. Isolate the connection management change to the existing HTableProvider implementation used throughout Metron and make a smaller, incremental change to set us up for the eventual upgrade to HBase 2.x.\r\n\r\nThis PR takes the approach in option 2. The biggest question surrounding this approach is whether the included connection management changes introduced in the TableProvider are sufficient, or if we need to immediately take a more robust connection pooling approach to dealing with HBase connections. I spent some time looking at the current HTable implementation that we depend on. Every time an HTable is created, the underlying code makes a call to an internal connection manager. It's unclear to me what the connection management contract is for the user in this case, e.g. stale connection cleanup, connection retries, connection pooling, etc. This is probably the riskiest part of this change. The way that I'm handling this is to \r\n1. Make the connections thread safe through use of a ThreadLocal connection variable. There are issues with instantiating a ThreadLocal variable by default in code that will be serialized by Storm. ThreadLocal is not serializable. In order to get around a massive API rewrite that would add initialization similar to our other startup hooks, e.g. StellarFunctions.initialize(), I opted for an approach that would allow us to get a similar effect via lazy initialization.\r\n2. Providing some basic connection retry logic that will initiate a new connection if the thread's current connection happens to have closed for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nThe combination of these 2 options provides a semi-robust way to handle connections without boiling the ocean as well as offering per-thread connection re-use that should limit the overall number of connections we keep open to HBase in a reasonable and reliable way.\r\n\r\nI'd like to connect with some HBase committers or just hop on their dev list and ask what the implications of leaving connections alone would be. Again, we don't really do anything to manage creating/closing connections currently, and afaict we have never had any reports of leaking connections. This doesn't mean we won't now, but it's worth noting what the status quo has been for a while now.\r\n\r\n**Note: This is a backwards compatible change**\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Create a simple file called `user.csv`.\r\n    ```\r\n    jdoe,192.168.138.2\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n  1. Create a file called `user-extractor.json`.\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"config\": {\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          },\r\n          \"indicator_column\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"separator\": \",\",\r\n          \"type\": \"user\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"extractor\": \"CSV\"\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Import the data.\r\n      ```\r\n      source /etc/default/metron\r\n      $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i ./user.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./user-extractor.json\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Validate that the enrichment loaded successfully.\r\n      ```\r\n      [root@node1 0.7.2]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n      [root@node1 0.7.2]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n      \r\n      [Stellar]>>> ip_dst_addr := \"192.168.138.2\"\r\n      192.168.138.2\r\n      \r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_dst_addr, 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {ip=192.168.138.2, user=jdoe}\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Use the User data to enrich the telemetry.  Run the following commands in the REPL.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> bro := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n      {\r\n       \"enrichment\" : {\r\n         \"fieldMap\": {\r\n           \"stellar\" : {\r\n             \"config\" : {\r\n               \"users\" : \"ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_dst_addr, 'enrichment', 't')\"\r\n             }\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n       },\r\n       \"threatIntel\": {\r\n         \"fieldMap\": {},\r\n         \"fieldToTypeMap\": {}\r\n       }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", bro, \"bro\")\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Wait for the new configuration to be picked up by the running topology.\r\n\r\n  1. Review the Bro telemetry indexed into Elasticsearch.  Look for records where the `ip_dst_addr` is `192.168.138.2`. Ensure that some of the messages have the following fields created from the enrichment.\r\n      * `users:user`\r\n      * `users:ip`\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"_index\": \"bro_index_2019.08.13.20\",\r\n        \"_type\": \"bro_doc\",\r\n        \"_id\": \"AWyMxSJFg1bv3MpSt284\",\r\n        ...\r\n        \"_source\": {          \r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.138.158\",\r\n          \"timestamp\": 1565729823979,\r\n          \"source:type\": \"bro\",\r\n          \"guid\": \"6778beb4-569d-478f-b1c9-8faaf475ac2f\"\r\n          ...\r\n          \"users:user\": \"jdoe\",\r\n          \"users:ip\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          ...\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n### Legacy HBase Adapter\r\n\r\nWe are going to perform the same enrichment, but instead using the legacy HBase Adapter.\r\n\r\n  1. Use the User data to enrich the telemetry.  Run the following commands in the REPL.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> yaf := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n      {\r\n        \"enrichment\" : {\r\n          \"fieldMap\" : {\r\n            \"hbaseEnrichment\" : [ \"ip_dst_addr\" ]\r\n          },\r\n          \"fieldToTypeMap\" : {\r\n             \"ip_dst_addr\" : [ \"user\" ]\r\n          },\r\n          \"config\" : {\r\n            \"typeToColumnFamily\" : {\r\n              \"user\" : \"t\"\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        \"threatIntel\" : { },\r\n        \"configuration\" : { }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", yaf, \"yaf\")\r\n      ```\r\n    \r\n  1. Wait for the new configuration to be picked up by the running topology.\r\n\r\n  1. Review the YAF telemetry indexed into Elasticsearch.  Look for records where the `ip_dst_addr` is `192.168.138.2`. Ensure that some of the messages have the following fields created from the enrichment.\r\n      * `enrichments:hbaseEnrichment:ip_dst_addr:user:ip`\r\n      * `enrichments:hbaseEnrichment:ip_dst_addr:user:user`\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"_index\": \"yaf_index_2019.08.15.03\",\r\n        \"_type\": \"yaf_doc\",\r\n        \"_id\": \"AWyTZAwEIFY9jxc2THLF\",\r\n        \"_version\": 1,\r\n        \"_score\": null,\r\n        \"_source\": {\r\n          \"source:type\": \"yaf\",\r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.138.158\",\r\n          \"guid\": \"6c73c09d-f099-4646-b653-762adce121fe\",\r\n          ...\r\n          \"enrichments:hbaseEnrichment:ip_dst_addr:user:ip\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          \"enrichments:hbaseEnrichment:ip_dst_addr:user:user\": \"jdoe\",\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      ```    \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

`metron/metron-interface/metron-alerts`. Run `npm test -- --code-coverage` to run tests and generate a coverage report. You should see a new directory at `metron-interface/metron-alerts/coverage`. Open the index.html file in the `coverage` directory in your browser. You should be able to click on the `src/app/alerts/alert-details` link to see the new coverage totals, which should match the new coverage stats included above. If you're interested, you can follow these same steps with the `master` branch in order to generate and see the old coverage stats.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nCurrently, Alerts UI sends a query request to the REST API every time the user \r\n- add new filter\r\n- clear filters\r\n- change time range\r\n\r\nThis behavior keeps the list of alerts and the state of the filtering in sync: every time the filter changes the visualized data change with it.\r\n\r\nThe drawback of this behavior is it fires multiple query requests while the user tries to set up a more complex filter.\r\n\r\nThe following scenario:\r\n1. clearing the current filter\r\n2. changing the time range\r\n3. adding a filter for ip_src_addr\r\n4. adding a filter for source:type\r\n5. pressing the query button\r\n\r\nleads 5 queries instead of one. In the case of large data sets, this could lead to unnecessary load and UI glitches (results update the alerts table with partially filtered data).\r\n\r\nTo fix this I ceased automatic querying on time-range or filter change and introduced staled data state. This means when the user making any changes in filtering compared to the previous result UI shows the following warning:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2019-08-07 15-52-22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/62628334-64f4ae00-b92b-11e9-84e4-2f754ff8d4ad.png)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nCheck out this branch and fire up the Alerts UI with the following script:\r\n/metron-interface/metron-alerts/scripts/start-dev.sh\r\nPR contains no backend changes so no rebuild of the full dev VM needed to test.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF Jira ticket [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2199).\r\n\r\nThis PR gives users the option to turn off the query building feature of the Alerts UI search input. By clicking on the manual query button in the search input, they can manually input queries with Lucene syntax. If a user builds a query with the query builder and switch to the manual query, their currently built query will appear in the manual query for their use.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nOpen the Alerts UI. Select a time range that will return a set of alerts. If you click on the `Use Manual Query` button, notice that it populates the timestamp values in the query (from the time range selector). If you click on `Use Query Builder`, the input should switch back to the query builder input and should appear with the default `*` value.\r\n\r\n![METRON-2199-step-1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/62621617-9ade6600-b91c-11e9-8080-8ab95dd0f43d.gif)\r\n\r\nWith the query builder enabled, try clicking on a column value to filter results.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR illustrates a proof on concept for a logging wrapper that supports lazy argument evaluation. Lazy parameter evaluation technique is automatically supported in Java 8 native logging (which we don't use), and log4j 2.4+ (which we appear to use via SLF4J wrappers).\r\nUnfortunately the lazy parameter evaluation provided by log4j 2.4+ is not currently exposed in the interfaces provided by the current SLF4J logging framework (support is scheduled for release with SLF4J 2.x) So to support lazy evaluation while maintaining use of the current SLF4j logging libraries a wrapper is required.\r\n\r\n## Rationale for lazy parameter evaluation\r\n\r\nEven though the logging framework will not construct a string unless the logging level indicates a log message will be needed, all parameter arguments are still evaluated by the JVM as part of the standard java parameter passing process.\r\n\r\nLazy parameter evaluation is a useful technique for when some arguments are very expensive to calculate (eg. Serialising a collection object into a JSON string). When disabled logging calls are deeply nested under multiple levels of iteration, then there can be a real hidden cost to this unneeded parameter evaluation overhead.\r\n\r\nThis PR illustrates a technique of utilising a logging wrapper that supports lambdas as logging parameters. Typical scenarios where this could be used include code scenarios such as:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nLOG.trace(\"Printed result of an expensive operation: {}\", expensiveOperation().toString())\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWhere expensiveOperation().toString is executed regardless of what logging level is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe suggested code to use with this wrapper would be\r\n<code>\r\nprivate static final LazyLogger LOG = LazyLoggerFactory.getLogger(MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass());\r\n\r\nLOG.trace(\"Expensive operation only if trace logging enabled: {}\", () -> expensiveOperation().toString()\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAs an example of usage\r\n```metron-platform/metron-writer/metron-writer-storm/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/writer/hdfs/HdfsWriter.java```\r\nhas been updated to utilise this wrapper module.\r\n\r\nMetron code has been analysed for logging usage, and those statements have been updated to use the lazy evaluation wrapper where it would be beneficial to performance.\r\n\r\nThe general guidance would be that any logging use that involves anything more than extremely basic string construction should use the lambda versions of the logging functions for performance reasons.\r\nError-level logging would be exempt from the requirement to use lambda versions of the logging functions due to error logging usually never being disabled, and thus no performance benefit is likely to come from forcing lazy parameter evaluation in this case.\r\n\r\nIf the lazy evaluation logging concept is approved I will add some unit testing before finalising the PR.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR illustrates a proof on concept for a logging wrapper that supports lazy argument evaluation.   Lazy parameter evaluation technique is automatically supported in Java 8 native logging (which we don't use), and log4j 2.4+ (which we appear to use via SLF4J wrappers). \r\nUnfortunately the lazy parameter evaluation provided by log4j 2.4+ is not currently exposed in the interfaces provided by the current SLF4J logging framework (support is scheduled for release with SLF4J 2.x)  So to support lazy evaluation while maintaining use of the current SLF4j logging libraries a wrapper is required.\r\n\r\n## Rationale for lazy parameter evaluation\r\nEven though the logging framework will not construct a string unless the logging level indicates a log message will be needed, all parameter arguments are still evaluated by the JVM as part of the standard java parameter passing process.  \r\n\r\nLazy parameter evaluation is a useful technique for when some arguments are very expensive to calculate (eg. Serialising a collection object into a JSON string).   When disabled logging calls are deeply nested under multiple levels of iteration, then there can be a real hidden cost to this unneeded parameter evaluation overhead.\r\n\r\nThis PR illustrates a technique of utilising a logging wrapper that supports lambdas as logging parameters. Typical scenarios where this could be used include code scenarios such as:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nLOG.trace(\"Printed result of an expensive operation: {}\", expensiveOperation().toString())\r\n\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWhere ```expensiveOperation().toString``` is executed regardless of what logging level is enabled.\r\n\r\nThe suggested code to use with this wrapper would be\r\n<code>\r\nprivate static final LazyLogger LOG = LazyLoggerFactory.getLogger(MethodHandles.lookup().lookupClass());\r\n\r\nLOG.trace(\"Expensive operation only if trace logging enabled: {}\", () -> expensiveOperation().toString()\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAs an example of usage  \r\n```metron-platform/metron-writer/metron-writer-storm/src/main/java/org/apache/metron/writer/hdfs/HdfsWriter.java```\r\nhas been updated to utilise this wrapper module.\r\n\r\nThe general guidance would be that any logging use that involves anything more than extremely basic string construction should use the lambda versions of the logging functions for performance reasons.  \r\nError-level logging would be exempt from the requirement to use lambda versions of the logging functions due to error logging usually never being disabled, and thus no performance benefit is likely to come from forcing lazy parameter evaluation in this case.\r\n\r\nIf the lazy evaluation logging concept is approved I will add some unit testing before finalising the PR.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

change upgrades all Enrichment and Data Management related components to work with HBase 2.0.2.\r\n* This PR is for the `feature/METRON-2088-support-HDP-3.1` feature branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR is dependent on the following PRs and the diff will show those changes here until that PR is merged\r\n- [x] #1458\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. Changes the default build profile so that everything is built against HBase 2.0.2.  Up until this PR, all changes on the `feature/METRON-2088-support-HDP-3.1` feature branch were backwards compatible.  I was not able to find a way to make many of these changes backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n1. Replaces all usages of the `LegacyHBaseClient` with the `HBaseClient`.  The `LegacyHBaseClient` is not compatible with 2.0.2.\r\n\r\n1. Removed all of the legacy `TableProvider` and *mock* HBase related classes.  These cannot be upgraded to HBase 2.0.2.\r\n\r\n1. Creates the `EnrichmentLookup` interface so that different implementations can be swapped in for testing where needed.  For example, a `FakeEnrichmentLookup` allows the Enrichment integration test to function where we are not able to run a live HBase instance.\r\n\r\n1. Updated the TAXII loader to use an `HBaseClient`.\r\n\r\n1. Updated Streaming Enrichments to use an `HBaseClient`.\r\n\r\n1. Updated the Enrichment coprocessor to use an `HBaseClient`.  The interfaces provided by HBase for a coprocessor also changed and required an update.\r\n\r\n1. Updated the Stellar functions `ENRICHMENT_GET` and `ENRICHMENT_EXISTS` for HBase 2.0.2.\r\n\r\n1. Updated the legacy HBase adapters for HBase 2.0.2.\r\n\r\n1. Removes the `LeastRecentlyUsedPruner`. This logic is exposed to the user in the script `bin/threatintel_bulk_prune.sh`.  I had some difficulty getting the integration test working and I do not believe this is worth the effort to upgrade.  I found almost no documentation around this functionality.  I fully expect to initiate more discussion around this.  If there is a need for this, I can work further on upgrading it.\r\n\r\n1. To simplify the class structure, `LookupKV<KEY_T, VALUE_T>` was replaced by `EnrichmentResult`.  The only `KEY_T` ever used is `EnrichmentKey` and the only `VALUE_T` ever used is `EnrichmentValue`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\n### Basics\r\n\r\n  Verify data is flowing through the system, from parsing to indexing\r\n\r\n  1. Open Ambari and navigate to the Metron service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/METRON/summary\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Alerts UI\r\n\r\n  1. Verify alerts show up in the main UI - click the search icon (you may need to wait a moment for them to appear)\r\n\r\n  1. Head back to Ambari and select the Kibana service http://node1:8080/#/main/services/KIBANA/summary\r\n\r\n  1. Open the Kibana dashboard via the \"Metron UI\" option in the quick links\r\n\r\n  1. Verify the dashboard is populating\r\n\r\n### Enrichment Coprocessor\r\n\r\n  1. Run the following command from the CLI - you should see the coprocessor in the table attributes. Ambari should set this up as part of the MPack installation.\r\n      ```\r\n      $ echo \"describe 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n\r\n      Table enrichment is ENABLED\r\n      enrichment, {TABLE_ATTRIBUTES => {coprocessor$1 => 'hdfs://node1:8020/apps/metron/coprocessor/metron-hbase-server-0.7.2-uber.jar|org.apache.metron.hbase.\r\n      coprocessor.EnrichmentCoprocessor||zookeeperUrl=node1:2181'}\r\n      COLUMN FAMILIES DESCRIPTION\r\n      {NAME => 't', VERSIONS => '1', EVICT_BLOCKS_ON_CLOSE => 'false', NEW_VERSION_BEHAVIOR => 'false', KEEP_DELETED_CELLS => 'FALSE', CACHE_DATA_ON_WRITE => '\r\n      false', DATA_BLOCK_ENCODING => 'NONE', TTL => 'FOREVER', MIN_VERSIONS => '0', REPLICATION_SCOPE => '0', BLOOMFILTER => 'ROW', CACHE_INDEX_ON_WRITE => 'fa\r\n      lse', IN_MEMORY => 'false', CACHE_BLOOMS_ON_WRITE => 'false', PREFETCH_BLOCKS_ON_OPEN => 'false', COMPRESSION => 'NONE', BLOCKCACHE => 'true', BLOCKSIZE\r\n      => '65536'}\r\n      1 row(s)\r\n      Took 5.9128 seconds\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Before we start adding enrichments, let's verify the enrichment_list table is empty\r\n\r\n  1. Go to Swagger\r\n\r\n  1. Click the `sensor-enrichment-config-controller` option.\r\n\r\n  1. Click the `GET /api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/list/available/enrichments` option.\r\n\r\n  1. And finally click the \"Try it out!\" button. You should see an empty array returned in the response body.\r\n\r\n###  Streaming Enrichments and Enrichment Stellar Functions in the REPL\r\n\r\n  1. Create a Streaming Enrichment [by following these instructions](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/06/16/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+6%3A+Streaming+Enrichment).\r\n\r\n  1. Define the streaming enrichment and save it as a new source of telemetry.\r\n\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> conf := SHELL_EDIT(conf)\r\n      {\r\n        \"parserClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.parsers.csv.CSVParser\",\r\n        \"writerClassName\": \"org.apache.metron.writer.hbase.SimpleHbaseEnrichmentWriter\",\r\n        \"sensorTopic\": \"user\",\r\n        \"parserConfig\": {\r\n          \"shew.table\": \"enrichment\",\r\n          \"shew.cf\": \"t\",\r\n          \"shew.keyColumns\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"shew.enrichmentType\": \"user\",\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>>\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PARSER\", conf, \"user\")\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Go to the Management UI and start the new parser called 'user'.\r\n\r\n  1. Create some test telemetry.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> msgs := [\"user1,192.168.1.1\", \"user2,192.168.1.2\", \"user3,192.168.1.3\"]\r\n      [user1,192.168.1.1, user2,192.168.1.2, user3,192.168.1.3]\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      [Stellar]>>> KAFKA_PUT(\"user\", msgs)\r\n      3\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Ensure that the enrichments are persisted in HBase.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.1', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user1,192.168.1.1, guid=a6caf3c1-2506-4eb7-b33e-7c05b77cd72c, user=user1, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.2', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user2,192.168.1.2, guid=49e4b8fa-c797-44f0-b041-cfb47983d54a, user=user2, timestamp=1551813589399, source.type=user}\r\n\r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', '192.168.1.3', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {original_string=user3,192.168.1.3, guid=324149fd-6c4c-42a3-b579-e218c032ea7f, user=user3, timestamp=1551813589402, source.type=user}\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n###  Load CSV enrichment data\r\n\r\n  1. Now, let's perform an enrichment load. We'll do this as the metron user\r\n      ```\r\n      su - metron\r\n      source /etc/default/metron\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Download the Alexa 1m dataset:\r\n      ```\r\n      wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip\r\n      unzip top-1m.csv.zip\r\n      head -10000 top-1m.csv > top-10k.csv\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Create an extractor.json for the CSV data by editing `extractor.json` and pasting in these contents:\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"config\": {\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"domain\": 1,\r\n            \"rank\": 0\r\n          },\r\n          \"indicator_column\": \"domain\",\r\n          \"separator\": \",\",\r\n          \"type\": \"alexa\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"extractor\": \"CSV\"\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Import the data.\r\n      ```\r\n      $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i /tmp/top-10k.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./extractor.json\r\n      # count data written and verify it's 10k\r\n      echo \"count 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Validate that the data was loaded.  Expect at least 10k records.\r\n      ```\r\n      echo \"count 'enrichment'\" | hbase shell\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n### Enrichment Coprocessor\r\n\r\n  Confirm that the enrichment added in the previous steps were 'found' by the coprocessor.\r\n\r\n  1. Go to Swagger\r\n\r\n  1. Click the `sensor-enrichment-config-controller` option.\r\n\r\n  1. Click the `GET /api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/list/available/enrichments` option.\r\n\r\n  1. Click the \"Try it out!\" button. You should see a array returned with the value of each enrichment type that you have loaded.\r\n    ```\r\n    [\r\n      \"alexa\",\r\n      \"user\"\r\n    ]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Enrichment Stellar Functions in Storm\r\n\r\n  1. Follow [instructions similar to these](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/04/28/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+2%3A+Creating+a+New+Enrichment) to load\r\n  the user data.\r\n\r\n  1. Create a simple file called `user.csv`.\r\n    ```\r\n    jdoe,192.168.138.2\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n  1. Create a file called `user-extractor.json`.\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"config\": {\r\n          \"columns\": {\r\n            \"user\": 0,\r\n            \"ip\": 1\r\n          },\r\n          \"indicator_column\": \"ip\",\r\n          \"separator\": \",\",\r\n          \"type\": \"user\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"extractor\": \"CSV\"\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Import the data.\r\n      ```\r\n      $METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i ./user.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./user-extractor.json\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Enrich the Bro telemetry using the \"user\" data.  Similar to [here](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/2016/06/16/Metron+Tutorial+-+Fundamentals+Part+6%3A+Streaming+Enrichment).\r\n\r\n  1. Validate that the enrichment loaded successfully.\r\n      ```\r\n      [root@node1 0.7.2]# source /etc/default/metron\r\n      [root@node1 0.7.2]# $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n      \r\n      [Stellar]>>> ip_dst_addr := \"192.168.138.2\"\r\n      192.168.138.2\r\n      \r\n      [Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_dst_addr, 'enrichment', 't')\r\n      {ip=192.168.138.2, user=jdoe}\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Use the User data to enrich the telemetry.  Run the following commands in the REPL.\r\n      ```\r\n      [Stellar]>>> bro := SHELL_EDIT()\r\n      {\r\n       \"enrichment\" : {\r\n         \"fieldMap\": {\r\n           \"geo\": [\"ip_dst_addr\", \"ip_src_addr\"],\r\n           \"host\": [\"host\"],\r\n           \"stellar\" : {\r\n             \"config\" : {\r\n               \"alexa\" : \"ENRICHMENT_GET('user', ip_dst_addr, 'enrichment', 't')\"\r\n             }\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n       },\r\n       \"threatIntel\": {\r\n         \"fieldMap\": {\r\n           \"hbaseThreatIntel\": [\"ip_src_addr\", \"ip_dst_addr\"]\r\n         },\r\n         \"fieldToTypeMap\": {\r\n           \"ip_src_addr\" : [\"malicious_ip\"],\r\n           \"ip_dst_addr\" : [\"malicious_ip\"]\r\n         }\r\n       }\r\n      }\r\n      [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"ENRICHMENT\", bro, \"bro\")\r\n      ```\r\n\r\n  1. Wait for the new configuration to be picked up by the running topology.\r\n\r\n  1. Review the telemetry indexing into Elasticsearch.  Look for records where the `ip_dst_addr` is `192.168.138.2`. Ensure that some of the messages have a field called `alexa` created from this enrichment.\r\n      ```\r\n      {\r\n        \"_index\": \"bro_index_2019.08.13.20\",\r\n        \"_type\": \"bro_doc\",\r\n        \"_id\": \"AWyMxSJFg1bv3MpSt284\",\r\n        ...\r\n        \"_source\": {          \r\n          \"ip_dst_addr\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          \"ip_src_addr\": \"192.168.138.158\",\r\n          \"timestamp\": 1565729823979,\r\n          \"source:type\": \"bro\",\r\n          \"guid\": \"6778beb4-569d-478f-b1c9-8faaf475ac2f\"\r\n          ...\r\n          \"alexa:user\": \"jdoe\",\r\n          \"alexa:ip\": \"192.168.138.2\",\r\n          ...\r\n        },\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n      ```\r\n      \r\n\r\n### Legacy Adapters in Storm\r\n\r\n  1.  A legacy HBase adapter is used in the default demo telemetry.\r\n\r\n  1.  Review the telemetry indexed into Elasticsearch.  Ensure that additional enrichment fields from the \"malicious_ip\" data is indexed into Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAs part of this PR I'm fixing the 'All time' range on the Alerts UI.

`SolrUpdateIntegrationTest` is not testing that the `SolrDao` can update and retrieve values. This fix is similar to what was done for Elasticsearch in #1451.\r\n\r\nThis replaces #1454 which was a more involved refactor that fixed some issues with code duplication and provided additional unit tests.  I am going to break-off just the bare minimum of what we need to fix the broken tests, rather than fix and refactor in the same PR.\r\n\r\n### What?\r\nThis gap in the integration test is hiding a couple bugs.  \r\n\r\n1. A timestamp is not being populated in the documents returned from Solr.\r\n\r\n1. The integration test is not accounting for the fact that comments are serialized differently when written to Solr versus Elasticsearch.  When comments are written to Solr, they are serialized as a list of JSON strings.  When comments are written to Elasticsearch, they are serialized as a list of maps.\r\n\r\n### Why? \r\nThese problems arise because of the way the test is setup.  Instead of directly testing a `SolrDao` this test runs against a `MultiIndexDao` initialized with both a `SolrDao` and an `HBaseDao`. On retrievals the `MultIndexDao` will return the document from whichever index responds first.\r\n\r\nWith the current test setup, the underlying `SolrDao` will never retrieve the document that the test case is expecting.  In all cases where the test passes, the document is actually being returned from the `HBaseDao` which is actually just interacting with a mock backend.  The test needs to actually test that we can update and retrieve documents from Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. The `SolrUpdateIntegrationTest` was changed so that it specifically tests a `SolrDao`.\r\n\r\n1. The `UpdateIntegrationTest` was changed so that it can handle comments stored as either strings or maps.  This allows the same integration tests to continue to work when run against either Solr or Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\n- [x] Validate against Elasticsearch.\r\n    1. Spin-up Full Dev with Elasticsearch running.\r\n    1. Ensure alerts are visible in the Alerts UI.\r\n    1. Add a comment to an alert.\r\n\r\n- [x] Validate against Solr.\r\n    1.

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to original JIRA ticket here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2179\r\n\r\nA PR was already opened for this a couple of days ago, but after some discussion it was decided that I should split out the Angular upgrade work from the central navigation implementation. To catch up on the discussion, you can check it out here: https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1460\r\n\r\nCurrently, both UIs approach navigation in two different ways. This makes the interfaces seem inconsistent and can be confusing for new users. Both ways are also not collapsible. We also cannot navigate between both UIs (this was intentional in the original implementation, but feedback from users over time seems to indicate separating the personas is not necessarily beneficial).\r\n\r\nThis is how the navigations currently look on master:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 11 42 38 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/61040529-0b06d400-a3d1-11e9-9778-7d4c3f893659.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 11 42 50 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/61040532-0c380100-a3d1-11e9-993d-03a5822ab178.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I added a collapsible sidebar navigation and removed the previous implemented navigations.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 10 18 17 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/61035559-aeeb8200-a3c7-11e9-92b0-a701064c9c78.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 10 18 27 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/61035570-b3179f80-a3c7-11e9-8847-6a2cc56cd773.png)\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, I utilized the Angular-version of [Ant Design's component library](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en). I did this because bootstrap does not contain a collapsible side navigation like this, and Ant Design allowed me to quickly implement this feature.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nOpen either the Alerts or Management UI. A navigation should exist on the left-hand side of the screen (see above screenshots), and you should be able to minimize it by clicking on the arrow at the bottom of the menu. Besides navigating within the app, you should be able to navigate between both UIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nREAD FIRST: This Pull Request seems very large, but a majority of the line changes are in the auto-generated package-lock.json file. There are less than one hundred lines of code changes outside of that auto-generated file. Now, breathe a sigh of relief. 😄\r\n\r\nLink to original ASF ticket [here](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2183).\r\n\r\nLong term support for Angular v6 will end in November this year, so we should update what version we use. Per the suggestion of the Angular team, we should update to version 7 before updating to 8.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I did exactly that and updated to version 7.2.15. In addition, I fixed a few unit tests that failed  due to stricter type checking with the updated version of typescript (part of the Angular upgrade).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSpin up Full Dev as you normally would. All unit tests for the Alerts and Management UI should pass, as well as the Cypress e2e tests in the Alerts UI. If you open both UIs in the browser and open the dev tools console, you can run `getAllAngularRootElements()[0].attributes[\"ng-version\"];` to see what version of Angular is running. It should show 7.2.15.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in the `SolrSearchDao` that excluded aliases from search requests.  A unit test was added to cover this case in the future.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev with the centos7 profile.  I found the instructions in the metron-solr README were out of date and have created a [task](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2182) to update it with instructions provided here.\r\n\r\n1. Install the zip utility with `yum -y install zip`\r\n2. Install Solr 6.6.2 using the script at `$METRON_HOME/bin/install_solr.sh`\r\n3. Create collections in Solr:\r\n```\r\nsource /etc/default/metron\r\nexport ZOOKEEPER=node1:9983\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh bro\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh snort\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh yaf\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh metaalert\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/create_collection.sh error\r\n```\r\n4. Follow the instructions in https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-platform/metron-solr/metron-solr-common#enabling-solr\r\n5. Verify data is flowing into Solr collections with the Solr UI at `http://node1:8983`\r\n6. Create an alias for the bro collection:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET http://node1:8983/solr/admin/collections?action=CREATEALIAS&name=broalias&collections=bro\r\n```\r\n7. A search against `broalias` should now succeed without error and return results:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"broalias\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\",\r\n  \"size\": 5\r\n}' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/search/search'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nIS_DATE stellar function is lenient while parsing date/time, so it even accepts alphanumeric chars and invalid date and month ranges are returned as true. This pull request is to make the parsing as non lenient.  \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce:\r\n1.  Start stellar shell $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER \r\n2. execute below stellar commands \r\n    ` [Stellar]>>> IS_DATE('123451321312-436292-2423y49812', 'yyyy-MM-dd')`\r\n      ` true`\r\n    ` [Stellar]>>> IS_DATE('22232234324-1-0d', 'yyyy-MM-dd')`\r\n       `true`\r\n    ` [Stellar]>>> IS_DATE('22232234324-1-1sdsadd', 'yyyy-MM-dd')`\r\n      ` true`\r\n\r\n### Testing:\r\nI tested this in full dev using the Stellar REPL . you need to perform below steps to verify:\r\n1. Spin up full dev and ensure everything comes up and data is being indexed\r\n2. Start stellar shell $METRON_HOME/bin/stellar -z $ZOOKEEPER \r\n3. execute below stellar commands and verify they return false for invalid date/month/year values\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> IS_DATE('123451321312-436292-2423y49812', 'yyyy-MM-dd')\r\nfalse\r\n[Stellar]>>> IS_DATE('22232234324-1-0d', 'yyyy-MM-dd')\r\nfalse\r\n[Stellar]>>> IS_DATE('22232234324-1-1sdsadd', 'yyyy-MM-dd')\r\nfalse\r\n[Stellar]>>> IS_DATE('1934-01-11', 'yyyy-MM-dd')\r\ntrue\r\n[Stellar]>>> IS_DATE('1934-01-32', 'yyyy-MM-dd')\r\nfalse\r\n[Stellar]>>> IS_DATE('1934-13-11', 'yyyy-MM-dd')\r\nfalse\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nREAD FIRST: This Pull Request seems very large, but a majority of the line changes are in the auto-generated package-lock.json file. There are maybe a one or two hundred lines of code changes outside of that auto-generated file. Now, breathe a sigh of relief. :smile:\r\n\r\nLink to original JIRA ticket here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2179\r\n\r\nCurrently, both UIs approach navigation in two different ways. This makes the interfaces seem inconsistent and can be confusing for new users. Both ways are also not collapsible. We also cannot navigate between both UIs (this was intentional in the original implementation, but feedback from users over time seems to indicate separating the personas is not necessarily beneficial).\r\n\r\nThis is how the navigations currently look on master:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 11 42 38 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/61040529-0b06d400-a3d1-11e9-9778-7d4c3f893659.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 11 42 50 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/61040532-0c380100-a3d1-11e9-993d-03a5822ab178.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I added a collapsible sidebar navigation and removed the previous implemented navigations.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 10 18 17 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/61035559-aeeb8200-a3c7-11e9-92b0-a701064c9c78.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 10 18 27 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7304869/61035570-b3179f80-a3c7-11e9-8847-6a2cc56cd773.png)\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, I utilized the Angular-version of [Ant Design's component library](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en). I did this because bootstrap does not contain a collapsible side navigation like this, and Ant Design allowed me to quickly implement this feature.\r\n\r\nI also had to upgrade our version of Angular to the latest stable 7 release. Upgrading from 6 to 7 did not introduce any breaking changes.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nOpen either the Alerts or Management UI. A navigation should exist on the left-hand side of the screen (see above screenshots), and you should be able to minimize it by clicking on the arrow at the bottom of the menu. Besides navigating within the app, you should be able to navigate between both UIs.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nAs part of this PR I'm implementing show/hide functionality for alert items based on their alert_status value. (Please note that however, the two show/hide toggle was part of the Alerts UI before, there was no actual working code behind them.)\r\nThe PR also contains a small cleanup of the surrounding code base. To implement this functionality QueryBuilder had to be made injectable. Most of the cleanup belongs to this change.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nIf User turn on 'Hide Dismissed Alerts' or 'Hide Resolved Alerts' in the 'Hide Alerts Entries' section of the row configuration pupup the posted query should be extended with a new hidden filter.\r\nState of the toggles should be saved to the local storage. After a page refresh, the same set of show/hide filters should apply to the requests.\r\n\r\n![show-hide-feature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/60902210-8cdeec00-a26f-11e9-9af5-eb852ea7b85f.gif)\r\n\r\nTest coverage of the new code is 100% in all metrics.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-07-09 at 3 25 35 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/60902288-abdd7e00-a26f-11e9-97f2-f58c0328df54.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

change updates the Profiler to function with HBase 2.0.2.\r\n* This PR is for the `feature/METRON-2088-support-HDP-3.1` feature branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR is dependent on the following PRs and the diff will show those changes here until that PR is merged\r\n- [x] #1456\r\n- [x] #1457\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Added a new method to the Stellar function resolver; `FunctionResolver.withInstance`.  This makes it possible to instrument and setup a Stellar function for testing, but also rely on the existing function resolution system for tests.\r\n\r\n* Altered `HBaseProfilerClient` to use the `HBaseClient` abstraction.\r\n\r\n* Created the `ProfilerClientFactory` and `HBaseProfilerClientFactory` that contains common code for creating a `ProfilerClient`.  This code was being duplicated in some of the different Stellar functions related to the Profiler.  This also makes it simpler to test this common code.\r\n\r\n* Update the `PROFILE_GET` and `PROFILE_VERBOSE` functions to use the `ProfilerClientFactory`.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\n**Note**: This needs to be tested in the centos6 environment built against HDP 2.6.  Some functionality, like the Batch Profiler, will not fully function until we fully upgrade other dependencies like HDFS to the HDP 3.1 versions.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure that we can continue to parse, enrich, and index telemetry.  Launch the development environment and ensure that telemetry is visible within the Alerts UI.  \r\n\r\n#### Profiler in the REPL\r\n\r\n1. Test a profile in the REPL according to [these instructions](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-repl#getting-started).\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> values := PROFILER_FLUSH(profiler)\r\n    [{period={duration=900000, period=1723089, start=1550780100000, end=1550781000000}, profile=hello-world, groups=[], value=4, entity=192.168.138.158}]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### Streaming Profiler\r\n \r\n1. Deploy that profile to the Streaming Profiler in Storm.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> CONFIG_PUT(\"PROFILER\", conf)\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Wait for the Streaming Profiler in Storm to flush and retrieve the measurement from HBase.  \r\n\r\n    For the impatient, you can reset the period duration to 1 minute. Alternatively, you can allow the Profiler topology to work for a minute or two and then kill the `profiler` topology which will force it to flush a profile measurement to HBase.\r\n\r\n    Retrieve the measurement from HBase.  Prior to this PR, it was not possible to query HBase from the REPL.\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"192.168.138.158\",PROFILE_FIXED(30,\"DAYS\"))\r\n    [2979]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n#### Batch Profiler\r\n\r\n1. Install Spark using Ambari.\r\n\r\n    1. Stop Storm, YARN, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Kafka.\r\n\r\n    1. Install Spark2 using Ambari.\r\n\r\n    1. Ensure that Spark can talk with HBase.\r\n        ```\r\n        cp /etc/hbase/conf/hbase-site.xml /etc/spark2/conf/\r\n        ```\r\n\r\n1. Use the Batch Profiler to back-fill your profile.  To do this, follow the direction [provided here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-analytics/metron-profiler-spark#getting-started).\r\n\r\n1. Retrieve the entire profile, including the back-filled data.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    [Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET(\"hello-world\",\"192.168.138.158\",PROFILE_FIXED(30,\"DAYS\"))\r\n    [1203, 2849, 2900, 1944, 1054, 1241, 1721]\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

change updates the REST service to work with HBase 2.0.2\r\n* This PR is for the `feature/METRON-2088-support-HDP-3.1` feature branch.\r\n* This PR is dependent on #1456 and #1454 . The diff will show those changes here until that PR is merged.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Modified the `UserSettingsClient` to use the `HBaseClient` abstraction.\r\n* This drove some of the additional operations that were added to the `HBaseClient` in #1456.\r\n* Made the `IndexDao` extend `Closeable` so that when the DAOs are instantiated via Spring, there is a way to clean-up resources, like HBase connections.\r\n* Modified the `HBaseDao` and related tests to work with HBase 2.0.2.\r\n* Created the `FakeHBaseClient` which makes testing anything that interacts with HBase, like `HBaseSettingsClient` possible.\r\n   * While this class is more complex than I'd like, I think its pros outweigh the cons.  It will be used in quite a few places to enable testing of classes that would normally need to interact with HBase. It is also an improvement over the previous \"Mock HBase\" code because its implementation does not rely on any HBase APIs.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis should not impact the deployment and functioning of the system.  As a sanity check, spin-up Full Dev and ensure alerts are visible.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can follow these steps to save and retrieve a user setting.\r\n\r\n1. Go to the Swagger UI.\r\n\r\n1. Retrieve the current user's settings using `GET /api/v1/alerts/ui/settings`. This should return 404 initially indicating there are no settings for the current user.\r\n\r\n1. Save a user setting.  Pass the following as the `alertsUIUserSettings` body to `POST /api/v1/alerts/ui/settings`.\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"facetFields\": [\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\"\r\n      ]\r\n      \"user\": \"admin\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n1. Retrieve the setting again using `GET /api/v1/alerts/ui/settings`.  This should return 200 with the following response body\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n      \"user\": \"admin\",\r\n      \"tableColumns\": null,\r\n      \"savedSearches\": null,\r\n      \"facetFields\": [\r\n        \"ip_src_addr\"\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR is for the `feature/METRON-2088-support-HDP-3.1` feature branch.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe major change in migration to HBase 2.0.2 is that connection management must now be managed by the client (us).  Previously this was managed internally within the HBase client.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, previously you could just instantiate a Table whenever you like and not worry about closing it.  Now you must first establish a `Connection` and from that `Connection`, you can create a `Table`. Both of those need to be closed after use.  A `Connection` can be shared by multiple threads, but a `Table` cannot be shared.\r\n\r\nMost of our existing abstractions were not designed to handle connection management, specifically closing the `Connection` and `Table` resources after use.  This is why the HBase upgrade is quite involved.\r\n\r\nThis Jira will introduce the new abstractions that allow Metron to interact with HBase 2.0.2, but not remove the existing ones.  I will then introduce additional follow-on PRs to start using these new abstractions in various parts of the Metron code base.  Finally, the existing abstractions that do not work with HBase 2.0.2 will be removed as a final step.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. Moved the legacy HBase client from `HBaseClient` to `LegacyHBaseClient`.  This allows the code to continue to function while the new abstractions are introduced.  The `LegacyHBaseClient` will be removed before the feature branch for HDP-3.1 is merged into master.\r\n\r\n1. Introduced two new profiles `HDP-2.6` and `HDP-3.1`. The `HDP-2.6` profile is currently the default and will continue to compile Metron with all the same versions that we do today.  After the HBase upgrade work is complete, we will change the default profile to `HDP-3.1`.\r\n\r\n1. Created the `HBaseClient` interface that expands on the methods provided by the `LegacyHBaseClient`.  These additional methods will allow it to be used more broadly across the code base in future PRs.\r\n    * Created the `HBaseTableClient` which uses HBase's Table to interact with HBase.\r\n\r\n1. Created the `HBaseClientFactory` that allows an `HBaseClient` to be injected as needed.\r\n\r\n1. Created a `HBaseConnectionFactory` that is responsible for creating connections to HBase.\r\n\r\n## Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\nThis should not impact the deployment and functioning of the system.  As a sanity check, spin-up Full Dev and ensure alerts are visible.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

`SolrUpdateIntegrationTest` is not testing that the `SolrDao` can update and retrieve values.\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR builds on #1451 .  The diffs here will include the changes in #1451 until that PR is merged.\r\n\r\n### What?\r\nThis gap in the integration test is hiding a few existing bugs in the `SolrUpdateIntegrationTest`.  This fix is similar to what was done for Elasticsearch in #1451.\r\n\r\n### Why? \r\nThese problems arise because of the way the test is setup.  Instead of directly testing a `SolrDao` this test runs against a `MultiIndexDao` initialized with both a `SolrDao` and an `HBaseDao`. On retrievals the `MultIndexDao` will return the document from whichever index responds first.\r\n\r\nWith the current test setup, the underlying `SolrDao` will never retrieve the document that the test case is expecting.  In all cases where the test passes, the document is actually being returned from the `HBaseDao` which is actually just interacting with a mock backend.  The test needs to actually test that we can update and retrieve documents from Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n### Bugs?\r\nAfter correcting the test setup in `SolrUpdateIntegrationTest` the following bugs were found.\r\n1. A timestamp is not being populated in the documents returned from Solr.\r\n1. The comment field is not removed from the document when the last comment is removed.\r\n1. A NullPointerException occurs if a document does not contain a sensor type.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n\r\n1. The `SolrUpdateIntegrationTest` was changed so that it specifically tests a `SolrDao`.\r\n\r\n1. The logic to serialize and deserialize a document to/from Solr was moved into a new abstraction called a `DocumentBuilder`.  The Solr DAOs now all use a `SolrDocumentBuilder` to do this.  Most of the existing logic from `SolrUtilities` was moved to `SolrDocumentBuilder`, except for portions that needed corrected.  \r\n\r\n    This allowed me to add unit tests for this logic in `SolrDocumentBuilderTests`. Specifically, I was able to add a test to ensure that the document's timestamp is being set correctly and that a missing sensor type does not cause a NullPointerException.\r\n\r\n1. Duplicate logic to add, remove, and (de)serialize comments existed in `UpdateIntegrationTest`, `SolrUpdateDao`, `SolrUtilities`, `HBaseUpdateDao`, and `ElasticsearchUpdateDao`. This logic was also not covered by unit tests.\r\n\r\n    The comment logic was moved to `Document` so that it could be reused.  This made it so that no additional \"reformatting\" logic was needed for the comments. This also made it easy to add unit tests to test this functionality in `DocumentTest`.\r\n\r\n1. After the previous change the logic for adding and removing comments is exactly the same for Solr, HBase, and Elasticsearch.  So there is no need for custom `addCommentToAlert` and `removeCommentFromAlert` in `HBaseUpdateDao`, `SolrUpdateDao`, and `ElasticsearchUpdateDao`.  The shared implementation for these was moved up to the `UpdateDao` interface as default methods.\r\n\r\n### Acceptance Testing\r\n\r\n- [ ] Validate against Elasticsearch.\r\n    1. Spin-up Full Dev with Elasticsearch running.\r\n    1. Ensure alerts are visible in the Alerts UI.\r\n    1. Add a comment to an alert.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Validate against Solr.\r\n    1. Spin-up Full Dev with Solr running.\r\n    1. Ensure alerts are visible in the Alerts UI.\r\n    1. Add a comment to an alert.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR upgrades Kafka 2.0.0 and Storm to 1.2.0.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Updated Kafka and Storm versions in Maven\r\n- Updated Maven pom files to include the correct dependency versions\r\n- Updated Maven profile in Ansible to HDP-3.1.0.0\r\n- Changed REST classes to use new Kafka client classes\r\n- Substituted Kafka constants for hardcoded strings\r\n- Upgraded to the `KafkaComponent` class to use new Kafka classes\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI have done some light testing in full dev including:\r\n\r\n- Verified all topologies are running with no errors and data is flowing through\r\n- Verified the Kafka REST endpoints functions as expected\r\n- Verified the Kafka Stellar functions continue to work\r\n\r\n### Future Work\r\nI believe there are parts of our codebase that we can deprecate in separate PRs:\r\n\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2170\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2171\r\n\r\nI also ran into several classpath version errors.  It is not possible to resolve these using the standard Maven exclude tags due to the issue described [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1436).  As a workaround, I move the conflicting dependency to the top of the pom so that it takes priority over the shaded dependencies.  This is not ideal but easier than trying to track the version down in the shaded dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2166\r\n\r\nThis is a test fix for a test condition that was using System.currentTimeMillis(). I also refactored a few of the tests for some additional clarity on what values are being compared and why.\r\n\r\n**Note**: this fix is required to fix a broken master build, so we should merge this in asap instead of waiting the typical 24 hour+ cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

`ElasticsearchUpdateIntegrationTest` is not testing that the `ElasticsearchDao` can update and retrieve values in a manner similar to what would occur in production.\r\n\r\n### What?\r\nWithin the Elasticsearch index, the test fails to define the 'guid' field to be of type 'keyword', instead the type is defaulted to 'text'.  In a production setting this mistake would prevent any documents from being found by guid.  Unfortunately, the test passes despite this. The test needs to match the behavior of what a user would experience in production.\r\n\r\n### Why? \r\nThese problems arise because of the way the test is setup.  Instead of directly testing an `ElasticsearchDao` as you might expect this test runs against a `MultiIndexDao` initialized with both an `ElasticseachDao` and an `HBaseDao`. On retrievals the `MultIndexDao` will return the document from whichever index responds first.\r\n\r\nWith the current test setup, the underlying `ElasticsearchDao` will never retrieve the document that the test case is expecting.  In all cases where the test passes, the document is actually being returned from the `HBaseDao` which is actually just interacting with a mock backend.  The test needs to actually test that we can update and retrieve documents from Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\n### Proof?\r\n If you alter the test to run against just an `ElasticsearchDao` the test will fail as follows in the attached log file.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThis only changes the integration tests.  Run the integration tests to validate these changes.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Split-Join Enrichment topology has been deprecated since November 2018. Metron defaults to using the Unified Enrichment topology currently.  This PR completely removes the Split-Join topology from the code base.\r\n\r\nHere is the [original discuss thread ](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/6cfc883de28a5cb41f26d0523522d4b93272ac954e5713c80a35675e@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E)on deprecation.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the CentOS 6 development environment.\r\n\r\n1. Ensure telemetry is being indexed and can be found via the Alerts UI.\r\n\r\n1. Go to Ambari > Metron > Configs > Enrichment > Topology and change some of the settings on this panel.  Restart the Enrichment topology and ensure that the settings have taken effect.\r\n\r\n1. Again, ensure telemetry is being indexed and indirectly that the Enrichment topology restarted correctly.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2161\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a handful of CSS bugs found in the Alerts and Management UI.

Please refer to the screenshots/gifs above for clarification on how it should look and behave.\r\n\r\n**Misaligned arrow in the datepicker:** This can be seen by simply opening the Alerts UI and visually checking the button.\r\n\r\n**Saved searches panel opens from wrong side:** Open the Alerts UI and click on the Saved Searches button. The panel should open from the left instead of the right.\r\n\r\n**Long message notification:** This is a little trickier because message notifications only last for 5 seconds, and you will need to edit the message to simulate a long message. First, start the UI from `metron-interface/metron-config` by running `npm ci` and `scripts/start-dev.sh` (this must be done so the UI can compile with the changes you're about to make in the next step). Open the alert file in metron-interface/metron-config/src/app/shared/metron-alerts.ts and update the SUCESS_MESSAGE_DISPALY_TIME const to something large (like 100000). Stop or start a parser. When the success message pops up, inspect the element and edit the content of the message in the browsers inspector. There should now be plenty of padding between the 'x' close button and the message. The message should also have margin on both the left and right side of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR attempts to resolve the recent spat of failed Travis CI builds. These builds seem to fail when attempting to download Maven from the Apache Mirrors.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to cache Maven so it does not need to be repeatedly downloaded from the Apache Mirrors.  This would mitigate the issue if there are transient problems with Travis connectivity to the Apache Mirrors or if the Apache Mirrors themselves are having sporadic outages.\r\n\r\nNote: This is a replacement for #1442. For some reason, Travis has refused to run a CI build for the additional commits that I have made on the original branch.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR attempts to resolve the recent spat of failed Travis CI builds. These builds seem to fail when attempting to download Maven from the Apache Mirrors.\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to cache Maven so it does not need to be repeatedly downloaded from the Apache Mirrors.  This would mitigate the issue if there are transient problems with Travis connectivity to the Apache Mirrors or if the Apache Mirrors themselves are having sporadic outages.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nWhile I was testing filtering in Alerts UI I found a few broken use cases. These broken scenarios of filtering were fixed as a part of this PR. It also contains a few lines of code cleanup around the bugfixes.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nBuild a full dev from this branch or run the Alerts UI in this branch locally against an existing full dev. (The fix contains no backend changes.)\r\nMake sure you have alert entries with status RESOLVE, DISMISS, NEW and OPEN.\r\n\r\n### Use the following filters to test:\r\n**Excluding filters:** (currently only works with ElasticSearch)\r\n```-alert_status:DISMISS AND -alert_status:RESOLVE```\r\n```-alert_status:(DISMISS OR RESOLVE)```\r\n**Field grouping:**\r\n```alert_status:(NEW OR OPEN)```\r\n**Whitespace and wildcard:**\r\n```' alert_status:OPEN'```\r\n(don't use the single quotes, but make sure you have a space at the beginning of the query)\r\n```'alert_status:OPEN '```\r\n(don't use the single quotes, but make sure you have a space at the end of the query)\r\n```* -alert_status:OPEN```\r\n\r\nNone of these queries works with the Alerts UI in the Master. All should work with this fix.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis primary purpose of this PR is to remove the Storm dependencies from metron-hbase.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- The metron-hbase module was split into metron-hbase-common and metron-hbase-storm\r\n- Package for `ColumnList`, `IColumn` and `ICounter` classes changed and moved to metron-hbase-common since they has no dependency on Storm\r\n- Package for `Widget` and `WidgetMapper` classes changed and moved to metron-hbase-storm since they are only used by classes in that module\r\n- Refactored Storm dependencies and related classes out of `HBaseClientTest`\r\n- Removed unused classes `TupleTableConfig`, `MockHBaseConnector`, and `HTableConnector`\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  I focused on testing HBase client interactions in Stellar and REST.\r\n\r\n#### Load an enrichment\r\nLoad the `alexa` enrichment with the `flatfile_loader.sh` script.  \r\n\r\n1. Download the alexa data set and put it in HDFS:\r\n```\r\nsu - metron\r\nsource /etc/default/metron\r\nwget http://s3.amazonaws.com/alexa-static/top-1m.csv.zip\r\nunzip top-1m.csv.zip\r\nhead -n 10000 top-1m.csv > top-10k.csv\r\nhdfs dfs -put top-10k.csv /tmp\r\n2. Load the enrichment:\r\nvi extractor.json\r\n{\r\n  \"config\": {\r\n    \"columns\": {\r\n      \"domain\": 1,\r\n      \"rank\": 0\r\n    },\r\n    \"indicator_column\": \"domain\",\r\n    \"separator\": \",\",\r\n    \"type\": \"alexa\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"extractor\": \"CSV\"\r\n}\r\n$METRON_HOME/bin/flatfile_loader.sh -i /tmp/top-10k.csv -t enrichment -c t -e ./extractor.json -m MR\r\nexit\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Verify REST\r\nTo verify REST is working correctly:\r\n\r\n1. Get a list of available enrichments.  `alexa` should be in the list:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/enrichment/config/list/available/enrichments'\r\n[\"alexa\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Store user settings:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' -d '{\r\n  \"facetFields\": [\r\n    \"test\"\r\n  ]\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/alerts/ui/settings'\r\n```\r\nand read them back:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 vagrant]# curl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/alerts/ui/settings'\r\n{\"user\":null,\"tableColumns\":null,\"savedSearches\":null,\"facetFields\":[\"test\"]}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Verify Stellar\r\nStart the Stellar shell with `/usr/metron/0.7.2/bin/stellar --zookeeper node1:2181`.\r\n\r\n1. Verify the `ENRICHMENT_GET` function works correctly:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_GET('alexa', 'google.com', 'enrichment', 't')\r\n{domain=google.com, rank=1}\r\n```\r\n2. I tested Stellar against different jars by creating `/usr/metron/0.7.2/contrib`, copying `metron-<module name>-storm*.jar`s and executing the `ENRICHMENT_GET` function.  I tested with `enrichment`, `profiler`, and `parsing`.  This should similar Stellar in the various topologies.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a `REST_POST` Stellar function with syntax and options similar to the existing `REST_GET` function for performing REST POST requests.  A Stellar map can now be passed into the function and added to the request as query parameters (this feature was added to `REST_GET` as well).  Separate global configs were added for `REST_GET` and `REST_POST` in addition to the existing global config for REST functions.  For `REST_POST` requests, there is also an option `enforce.json` that ensures POST data is well-formed JSON.\r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- `REST_POST` Stellar function was added to `RestFunctions` class.\r\n- `RestFunctions` class was refactored by moving common code used by `REST_GET` and `REST_POST` to their own methods.  Now code specific to either functions mostly consists of argument parsing and request building.\r\n- Unit and integration tests were moved to separate tests.  The `RestFunctions` class should be 100% covered.\r\n- Documentation added for the new `REST_POST` function and additional options added to both.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Since there were significant changes to `RestFunctions` I regression tested using the test instructions in original [Stellar Rest PR](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1250).  Note a regression was introduced when using the `REST_GET` function in the enrichment topology (class version error).  This is being addressed [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1436).\r\n\r\nIn addition to this I also followed these instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Assuming full dev has already been spun up during regression testing described above, start the Stellar shell with `/usr/metron/0.7.2/bin/stellar --zookeeper node1:2181`.\r\n\r\n2. Defined a variable to hold POST data:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> data := {'key':'value'}\r\n{key=value}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Send a POST request to a test service (httpbin.org in this example):\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_POST('http://httpbin.org/post', data)\r\n{args={}, data={\"key\":\"value\"}, files={}, form={}, headers={Accept=application/json, Accept-Encoding=gzip,deflate, Content-Length=15, Content-Type=application/json, Host=httpbin.org, User-Agent=Apache-HttpClient/4.3.2 (java 1.5)}, json={key=value}, origin=136.49.31.47, 136.49.31.47, url=https://httpbin.org/post}\r\n```\r\nThe request should succeed with the correct POST data in the response.\r\n\r\n4. Define a variable to hold query parameters:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> params := {'param1': 'value1', 'param2': 'value2'}\r\n{param1=value1, param2=value2}\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Send a POST request, passing in the query parameter variable:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_POST('http://httpbin.org/post', data, {}, params)\r\n{args={param1=value1, param2=value2}, data={\"key\":\"value\"}, files={}, form={}, headers={Accept=application/json, Accept-Encoding=gzip,deflate, Content-Length=15, Content-Type=application/json, Host=httpbin.org, User-Agent=Apache-HttpClient/4.3.2 (java 1.5)}, json={key=value}, origin=136.49.31.47, 136.49.31.47, url=https://httpbin.org/post?param1=value1&param2=value2}\r\n```\r\nThe `args` and `url` attributes in the response should contain the query parameters.\r\n\r\n6. Test configuration priority by changing the empty response override in various configs.  First enable 404 responses and set an override:\r\n```\r\n%define stellar.rest.settings := {'response.codes.allowed': [200, 404],  'empty.content.override': {}}\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_POST('http://httpbin.org/status/404', data)\r\n{}\r\n```\r\nThe response should match the override value set in the config.\r\n\r\n7. Configure the override for all REST functions:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_POST('http://httpbin.org/status/404', data)\r\nglobal rest config\r\n```\r\nThe response should match the global override value set in the config.\r\n\r\n8. Configure the override for REST_POST functions:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> %define stellar.rest.post.settings := {'empty.content.override': 'rest post config'}\r\n{empty.content.override=rest post config}\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_POST('http://httpbin.org/status/404', data)\r\nrest post config\r\n```\r\nThe response should match the rest post override value set in the config.\r\n\r\n9 Configure the override in a variable that will be passed to the function:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> config := {'empty.content.override': 'function config'}\r\n{empty.content.override=function config}\r\n[Stellar]>>> REST_POST('http://httpbin.org/status/404', data, config)\r\nfunction config\r\n```\r\nThe response should match the override in the config passed to the function.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a minor bug in the `ParserBolt` that calls the incorrect method when processing errors from the `ParserRunner`.  The `StormParserDriver.handleError` method overrides the `ParserBolt.handleError` method but is never called because `StormErrorUtils.handleError` is called directly.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis fix should give more useful information on a failed test.  Add text to the first line of `https://github.com/apache/metron/blob/master/metron-platform/metron-integration-test/src/main/sample/data/asa/raw/asa_raw` and run the `StormParserIntegrationTest`.  You should get detailed log data about which messages passed and which messages failed along with various stack traces.  Before this PR only a single stack trace was printed.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2152\r\n\r\nThis enables some additional debug logging.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\n- In the Storm UI, click on the random_access_indexing topology.\r\n- Click \"Change Log Level\"\r\n- Add a `org.apache.metron.writer` logger set to DEBUG with timeout 5000.\r\n- Pull down the latest ZK configs\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PULL -o ${METRON_HOME}/config/zookeeper -z $ZOOKEEPER -f\r\n    ```\r\n- Update the bro config for ES indexing at `$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/indexing/bro.json`. Add a batchTimeout of 15 to elasticsearch, e.g.\r\n    ```\r\n    \"elasticsearch\" : {\r\n        \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n        \"batchSize\": 5,\r\n        \"batchTimeout\": 15,\r\n        \"enabled\" : true\r\n    },\r\n    ```\r\n- Push the changes back up to ZK\r\n    ```\r\n    $METRON_HOME/bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i $METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/ -z $ZOOKEEPER\r\n    ```\r\n- Open the Storm worker logs for random_access_indexing. You should see the following in the logs:\r\n    ```\r\n    The configured batch timeout '15' for sensor type 'bro' is <=0 or > the maximum allowable batch timeout '14'. Setting the batch timeout to the maximum allowable.\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR updates the appropriate Maven pom.xml files to use a classifier when building shaded jars.  After this change all shaded jars will follow the pattern `${project.artifactId}-${project.version}-uber.jar` whereas before some jars would follow this pattern while others would follow `${project.artifactId}-${project.version}.jar`.\r\n\r\nI believe this will provide a substantial benefit to the project because it will alleviate 2 significant issues.  When a module that uses the shaded plugin without a classifier is added to another module as a dependency:\r\n\r\n1. Any Maven excludes added to that dependency are ignored\r\n2. The Maven dependency:tree tool does not accurately report the transitive dependencies pulled in by that dependency\r\n\r\nThese issues make it extremely difficult to troubleshoot and resolve classpath version problems.  \r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- Appropriate modules were updated to use a classifier\r\n- Scripts and RPM spec files were updated with the new jar names\r\n- New classpath version issues introduced with this change were fixed\r\n- Minor formatting issues were fixed in a couple pom files\r\n- All `stellar-common` maven dependencies were changed to `provided`\r\n- Various scripts were updated to add stellar-common to the classpath separately\r\n- The `metron-data-management` pom file needed a plugin to include stellar as an external dependency\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nSince this PR effectively changes the contents and ordering of dependencies in our jars, exhaustive regressing testing is needed.  I have started this and will update these instructions I get think of more and get further along.  Please feel free to add other tests.  These instructions have all been performed on full dev.\r\n\r\n#### Smoke Test\r\n\r\nThis is a quick test to verify things are working normally:\r\n\r\n- Make sure sensor data flows to the Alerts UI\r\n- Make sure there are no errors in Storm or the error ES Index\r\n\r\n#### Typosquat Test\r\n\r\nThe use case is detailed [here](https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/use-cases/typosquat_detection).\r\n\r\nI had to perform these extra steps:\r\n\r\n- Install `wget` with ` yum install -y wget`\r\n- Increase the `OBJECT_GET` cache size in the global config:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"es.clustername\": \"metron\",\r\n

several requests against REST and verified there were no errors:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' -d '{\r\n  \"facetFields\": [\r\n

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2145\r\n\r\nThe context for building **only** the RPMs comes after the Quick Start, so when looking for a quick reference to building only the RPMs you'll unwittingly end up building all of Metron first as well. Added a brief note before the command to make that more apparent. Also fixed a typo for the rpm profile name in the build packages section.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nCurrently installing solr schema on a secured cluster has dependency on solr-service keytab be installed on the metron node. So we should install the solr schema as metron user using the metron keytab to remove the dependency over solr-service keytab.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce \r\n1. Deploy multinode metron cluster \r\n2. make sure the Solr is installed on non metron node\r\n3. Kerberize the cluster before starting the indexing server \r\n4. starting indexing service fails while kinit the solr user. \r\n\r\nVerified the fix using a multinode cluster \r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-05-24 at 3 14 09 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12934693/58319028-a5698300-7e36-11e9-9c12-16ef0cb54cee.png)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nClick Through Navigation is a feature makes Metron Users able to reach other web services via dynamically created URLs by clicking link item in a context menu.\r\nThis context menu (aka. click-through menu) is attached to the alerts table and the links are populated with alert data from the specific row of the table. \r\n\r\nItems and URLs in the context menu based on a configuration (this is currently a JSON file). A configuration could be attached to a cell or a row.\r\nIf you like to attach a menu configuration to a cell of a column you should use the field id (what field of the alert populates the column) to target the particular column.\r\n\r\nIf you like to learn more about the feature or the possible ways of configuration please check the description in the [Jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2102).\r\n\r\n![click-trough-menu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/58275423-4273df80-7d95-11e9-8136-646b1b9ed691.gif)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"637\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-23 at 7 35 56 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/58273972-1b67de80-7d92-11e9-80a9-25257b6f9832.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"606\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-05-23 at 7 35 35 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2437400/58273953-1440d080-7d92-11e9-951e-804112519de4.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2134\r\nLink to Parent Feature ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1856\r\n\r\nIn NgRx, reducers are responsible for performing actual state changes in the global store. When something has been changed, it's the reducer's job to put it in the store in the appropriate way.\r\n\r\nhttps://ngrx.io/guide/store/reducers\r\n\r\nThe implementation is pretty straightforward. Every reducer has the appropriate action to listen to and react to it. For example, if we would like to start a parser, there must be a \"start parser\" action in order to trigger a state change that hasn't happened yet. It's the responsible who will update the store.\r\n\r\n## Related commits\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of a larger sequence of PRs we are opening to make the reviewing process of the relatively large Parser Aggregation UI feature easier.\r\n\r\nTo see only the changes that apply to this PR, please review the last commit in the list of commits (the commit to review contains the title of the PR)\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about why we picked this method, please refer to the discussion thread [here](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5317307447c0a44491369fcf7126a3ba1d55c70a2b9d4d73f3953091@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\nPlease find the full list of relating PRs below.\r\n\r\nPR#1 [METRON-2114: [UI] Moving components to sensor parser module](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1410)\r\nPR#2 [METRON-2116: [UI] Removing redundant AppConfigService](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1411)\r\nPR#3 [METRON-2117: [UI] Aligning models to grouping feature](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1412)\r\nPR#4 [METRON-2115: [UI] Aligning UI to the parser aggregation AP](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1414)\r\nPR#5 [METRON-2122: [UI] Fixing early app config access issue](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1415)\r\nPR#6 [METRON-2124: [UI] Move status information and start/stop to the Aggregate level](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1418)\r\nPR#7 [METRON-2125: [UI] Making changes visible in the parser list by marking changed items](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1422)\r\nPR#8 [METRON-2131: Add NgRx and related dependencies](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1423)\r\nPR#9 [METRON-2133: Add NgRx effects to communicate with the server](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1424)\r\n**CURRENT PR#10 [METRON-2134: Add NgRx reducers to perform parser and group changes in the store](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1425)**\r\nPR#11 [METRON-2135: Add NgRx actions to trigger state changes](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1426)\r\nPR#12 [METRON-2136: Add parser aggregation sidebar](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1427)\r\nPR#13 [METRON-2137: Implement drag and drop mechanism and wire NgRx](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1428)\r\nPR#14 [METRON-2138: Code clean up](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1429)\r\nPR#15 [METRON-2139: Refactoring sensor-parser-config.component and wire NgRx](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1430)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2125\r\nLink to Parent Feature ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1856\r\n\r\nThis PR contains work that adds different highlighting to parsers and groups in changed/deleted/new states. We need to add visual styling to parsers when they are in a changed state but before those changes have been submitted to be persisted on the server. For example, when we create a new parser, when we create a new group, when we add or remove a parser from a group, or when we delete a parser or group.\r\n\r\nAs stated in other PRs opened against this feature branch, this is a subset of changes that cannot be tested without other work in multiple PRs for this feature. This breakdown has been done to make code reviewing easier.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nOpen the Management UI in your browser by running `scripts/start_dev.sh` at `metron-interface/metron-config` and opening `localhost:4200` in your browser. Try creating a parser group by drag and dropping a parser onto another. Select 'create new' from the right side window and name your parser group. Click the done button. You'll notice that the group is highlighted green, representing a new state. Also notice the parsers, which existed before but are now grouped, are highlighted yellow, representing a changed state. If you try to delete a parser or group after it's been created, you'll notice it's highlighted red, representing a deleted state.\r\n\r\nAll these highlighted colors represent a proposed state before persisting to the backend with the 'Apply' button or cancelling the changes with the 'Cancel' button.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Due to how the code for this feature is being split up, it is best to test this in the final PR listed below.\r\n\r\n## Related commits\r\nThis PR is part of a larger sequence of PRs we are opening to make the reviewing process of the relatively large Parser Aggregation UI feature easier.\r\n\r\nTo see only the changes that apply to this PR, please review the last commit in the list of commits (the commit to review contains the title of the PR)\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about why we picked this method, please refer to the discussion thread [here](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5317307447c0a44491369fcf7126a3ba1d55c70a2b9d4d73f3953091@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\nPlease find the full list of related PRs below.\r\n\r\nPR#1 [METRON-2114: [UI] Moving components to sensor parser module](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1410)\r\nPR#2 [METRON-2116: [UI] Removing redundant AppConfigService](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1411)\r\nPR#3 [METRON-2117: [UI] Aligning models to grouping feature](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1412)\r\nPR#4 [METRON-2115: [UI] Aligning UI to the parser aggregation AP](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1414)\r\nPR#5 [METRON-2122: [UI] Fixing early app config access issue](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1415)\r\nPR#6 [METRON-2124: [UI] Move status information and start/stop to the Aggregate level](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1418)\r\n**CURRENT PR#7 METRON-2125: [UI] Making changes visible in the parser list by marking changed items** \r\nPR#8 [METRON-2131: Add NgRx and related dependencies](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1423)\r\nPR#9 [METRON-2133: Add NgRx effects to communicate with the server](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1424)\r\nPR#10 [METRON-2134: Add NgRx reducers to perform parser and group changes in the store](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1425)\r\nPR#11 [METRON-2135: Add NgRx actions to trigger state changes](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1426)\r\nPR#12 [METRON-2136: Add parser aggregation sidebar](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1427)\r\nPR#13 [METRON-2137: Implement drag and drop mechanism and wire NgRx](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1428)\r\nPR#14 [METRON-2138: Code clean up](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1429)\r\nPR#15 [METRON-2139: Refactoring sensor-parser-config.component and wire NgRx](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1430)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2129\r\n\r\nThe problem\r\n=========\r\n\r\nYou add a search criteria and also add a time range (e.g. Last 90 days) in which you want to investigate. Then you decide you would like to clean the search field by clicking on the remove icon on the right side of the search bar. This action has effect on the time range as well and sets it to \"All time\" but it should not.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n=====\r\n\r\n- Go to the alerts list screen on the alerts UI.\r\n- Add a search criteria to the search field at the top of the screen\r\n- Set the time range to something else like \"last 90 days\"\r\n- Click on the (X) icon on the right side of the search bar to clean the search field.\r\n- The action should have an effect on the time range. It should be still \"last 90 days\"\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLink to ASF Jira ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2124\r\nLink to Parent Feature ticket: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-1856\r\n\r\nThis PR contains work that allows us to group actions for parser groups together. When parsers are grouped, we want to be able to start/stop from the aggregate level. This means hiding individual parser controls when they are grouped, controlling multiple parsers with a single set of controls for a group, and displaying status information as a group.\r\n\r\nAs stated in other PRs opened against this feature branch, this is a subset of changes that cannot be tested without other work in following PRs (will list here when they are opened). This breakdown has been done to make code reviewing easier.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nOpen the Management UI in your browser by running `scripts/start_dev.sh` at `metron-interface/metron-config` and opening `localhost:4200` in your browser. If you don't have any parser groups yet, drag and drop a set of parsers together in the UI to create a group. If you look at the created group, there should be one set of controls to start, stop, enable and disable the group.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Due to how the code for this feature is being split up, it is best to test this in the final PR listed below.\r\n\r\n## Related commits\r\nThis PR is part of a larger sequence of PRs we are opening to make the reviewing process of the relatively large Parser Aggregation UI feature easier.\r\n\r\nTo see only the changes that apply to this PR, please review the last commit in the list of commits (the commit to review contains the title of the PR)\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more about why we picked this method, please refer to the discussion thread [here](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/5317307447c0a44491369fcf7126a3ba1d55c70a2b9d4d73f3953091@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\nPlease find the full list of relatied PRs below.\r\n\r\nPR#1 [METRON-2114: [UI] Moving components to sensor parser module](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1410)\r\nPR#2 [METRON-2116: [UI] Removing redundant AppConfigService](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1411)\r\nPR#3 [METRON-2117: [UI] Aligning models to grouping feature](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1412)\r\nPR#4 [METRON-2115: [UI] Aligning UI to the parser aggregation AP](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1414)\r\nPR#5 [METRON-2122: [UI] Fixing early app config access issue](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1415)\r\n**CURRENT PR#6 METRON-2124: [UI] Move status information and start/stop to the Aggregate level** \r\nPR#7 [METRON-2125: [UI] Making changes visible in the parser list by marking changed items](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1422)\r\nPR#8 [METRON-2131: Add NgRx and related dependencies](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1423)\r\nPR#9 [METRON-2133: Add NgRx effects to communicate with the server](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1424)\r\nPR#10 [METRON-2134: Add NgRx reducers to perform parser and group changes in the store](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1425)\r\nPR#11 [METRON-2135: Add NgRx actions to trigger state changes](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1426)\r\nPR#12 [METRON-2136: Add parser aggregation sidebar](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1427)\r\nPR#13 [METRON-2137: Implement drag and drop mechanism and wire NgRx](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1428)\r\nPR#14 [METRON-2138: Code clean up](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1429)\r\nPR#15 [METRON-2139: Refactoring sensor-parser-config.component and wire NgRx](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1430)\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

This makes the code cleaner and gives us the opportunity to initialize the parser config state inside a separated module.** \r\n\r\n(Please keep in mind this is only a subset of changes belongs to Parser Aggregation UI, therefore, you not gonna be able to test the whole function through this PR alone. Because of the same reason some unit tests might failing.

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2112\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces work to address the issue with `original_string` brought up in the DISCUSS thread [[DISCUSS] JsonMapParser original string functionality](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/2dbf068cd2144ea3bda8d652b4e866c74b3ef9e96510c63ff27335b4@%3Cdev.metron.apache.org%3E)\r\n\r\nThe discussion concluded with a solution that would:\r\n1. Address the regression\r\n2. Make the handling of original_string more generalized and universally applied across all parsers\r\n3. Allow individual parsers to override the original_string, if desired.\r\n4. Not screw up parser chaining\r\n\r\nThis is discussed in more detail in the README, but here's a rundown of the settings:\r\n\r\n- Global config option added `parser.original.string.global`, defaults to `true`. By default, this will now enable the parser runner to append an `original_string` using the true raw source message. Note, for backwards compatibility, the implementation uses a putIfAbsent approach. This approach is to keep from completely breaking parser chaining due to the way enveloped message parsing works (hint: it's our only real special system-level case). Setting the property to false will mean the runner will not attempt to add `original_string` at all.\r\n- Modification to JsonMapParser to accept a new configuration option `overrideOriginalString`. The default of `false` addresses the regression introduced by jsonpquery and will not attempt to add an `original_string`. Setting this value to `true` will effectively override the global setting and apply an `original_string` per message generated that reflects the existing functionality.\r\n\r\nI also addressed a few random doc and test issues I noticed while modifying the code for this PR. e.g. global config sub-section links, missing/omitted test assertions, etc.\r\n\r\nMore exhaustive test instructions to follow. In the meantime, this PR is ready for code and doc review. Most importantly, the functionality I've outlined here and in the README's should be reviewed. I have not modified any of the parsers besides JsonMapParser. If we think they should have their default functionality changed, I propose we open a separate DISCUSS thread for this and provide a migration path for existing users that may or may not be impacted by any change. I suspect that only JSON parsers should be affected.\r\n\r\nConsidering the origin and impact of this change, I presume this will warrant a mention in Upgrading.md. I have not done this yet, but would like to hear any specific concerns or feedback on wording.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nLEEF is a popular format in IBM shops as it is the default supported by Qradar. In a number of ways it is similar to CEF. This PR supports LEEF 1.0 and 2.0 per the IBM guide at https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS42VS_DSM/c_LEEF_Format_Guide_intro.html and also some found in the wild examples which are technically not up to the IBM spec, and are much closer to the CEF spec.\r\n\r\nThe CEF parser has been slightly refactored in this effort to expose CEF extension parsing for reuse in the LEEF parser for in the wild examples of CEF style 'delimiters'.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested against a variety of samples from public sources, and from synthetic data generated according to the spec in new unit tests.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds the option described in the title.  A user can now configure a sensor (or all sensors) to use the Metron generated GUID instead of letting Elasticsearch generate one.  \r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n- Added a configuration option to the various indexing and writer configuration classes\r\n- Added logic in the `ElasticsearchWriter` class to conditionally include the Metron GUID as the document id\r\n- Added unit tests to cover this new use case\r\n- Added documentation to the metron-indexing README explaining the setting\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev. \r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and verify data is showing up in Elasticsearch and the Alerts UI\r\n2. Perform a basic search against the bro index:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"from\": 0,\r\n  \"indices\": [\r\n    \"bro\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"query\": \"*\",\r\n  \"size\": 5\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/search/search'\r\n```\r\nThe `id` fields should have an id that was generated by ES:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"total\": 93780,\r\n  \"results\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"AWqbP-_e08M1mJHcFnht\",\r\n      \"source\": {\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n3. Configure the `bro` sensor to use the Metron generated GUID instead:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  \"hdfs\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n    \"enabled\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"elasticsearch\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n    \"enabled\": true,\r\n    \"metronId\": true\r\n  },\r\n  \"solr\": {\r\n    \"index\": \"bro\",\r\n    \"batchSize\": 1,\r\n    \"enabled\": true\r\n  }\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/indexing/config/bro'\r\n```\r\n4. Perform another search against `bro` and verify the `id` field is now the same as the Metron `guid` field:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"total\": 95475,\r\n  \"results\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"id\": \"023ed7d1-3d1a-4530-bd1c-8a177e9a8323\",\r\n      \"source\": {\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n5. Perform a search against `snort` and verify the `id` field is still being generated by ES.\r\n6. Set all sensors to use the Metron generated GUID in the global config:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n    ...\r\n    \"indexing.writer.metronId\": true\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/global/config'\r\n```\r\n7. Verify searches against `bro`, `snort`, and `yaf` all return results with the `id` field set to the Metron `guid` field.\r\n8. Navigate to the Alerts UI.  Verify messages (with and without the Metron generated GUID) can be updated by clicking on an alert and setting it's status to `OPEN` or any other status.\r\n\r\nI also tested the REST endpoints directly and found no issues.  \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nThis was the earliest iteration of the Parser Aggregation UI feature.\r\n\r\nBy checking out this branch, you can see how you can group multiple parsers together by grabbing and dropping them on another row in the table or between two rows. You can also see the right floating pane with which you can create new groups after naming them.\r\n\r\nThis version is very close to the design plans, and in this PR we also removed the table's sorting capabilities since it didn't make sense to keep it when it's kind of like a nested tree.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the tests are failing. The reason is that, at this point, we didn't know if this work would or wouldn't be part of the final implementation for this feature.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a small bug in the Metron REST start script that incorrectly configures the property files.  Properties defined in `rest_application.yml` (where Ambari-managed properties are written) are being overridden by the defaults when the opposite should happen.  This fixes that by updating the configuration to load `rest_application.yml` before the defaults.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev.  Spin up full dev and configure a custom escalation topic in Ambari (Ambari > Services > Metron > Configs > REST > Metron escalation topic).  Escalate a message:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: */*' -d '[\r\n  {\"field\":\"value\"}\r\n]' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/alerts/ui/escalate'\r\n```\r\nThe message should appear in the custom escalation topic rather than the default `escalation` topic.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR adds a Stellar function for performing in-memory enrichments.  Similar to `ENRICHMENT_GET`, which performs lookups in HBase, this function performs lookups from an in-memory map that is loaded from HDFS.  The `nosql_table`, `enrichment_type`, and `column_family` parameters in `ENRICHMENT_GET` are similar to the `ENRICHMENT_IN_MEMORY_GET` `path` parameter in that they uniquely identify the data source.  The `indicator` parameter is the same (the key used to lookup an enrichment).  The new function is very similar to the `OBJECT_GET` function (they use the same cache abstraction) except that it performs the lookup, offers configuration specifically for in-memory enrichments, and potentially more.  The in-memory objects are lazy-loaded, meaning they are loaded the first time an `ENRICHMENT_IN_MEMORY_GET` is executed.\r\n\r\nThe Jira states the first pass should be a 1-time load but it wasn't difficult to expose cache expiration settings.  This allows cached enrichments to be refreshed at an interval and will support streaming enrichments. \r\n\r\nCache settings are applied in the following order:\r\n\r\n1. Hardcoded defaults defined in constants\r\n2. Top-level global config settings (used by the `OBJECT_GET` function)\r\n3. Global config settings specific for `ENRICHMENT_IN_MEMORY_GET`\r\n\r\nThese settings are passed into the Guava `CacheBuilder` when the function is initialized.   \r\n\r\n### Changes Included\r\n\r\n- An `ObjectCache` abstraction was created from the code in the Stellar `OBJECT_GET` function.  This abstraction is shared by both the `OBJECT_GET` and `ENRICHMENT_IN_MEMORY_GET` functions.  The current settings used in `OBJECT_GET` should be backwards compatible.\r\n- Dedicated cache settings for `ENRICHMENT_IN_MEMORY_GET` can be configured in the global config with the `in.memory.enrichment.settings` key.  \r\n- Unit tests were added for new code and expanded for existing code.\r\n- Logging was added in various places to make it easier to determine when entries are being flushed and for what reason.\r\n\r\n### Testing Instructions\r\nThis has been tested in full dev with the Stellar CLI.\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and ensure data is flowing with no errors.\r\n2. Create a `enrichments.csv` file with enrichment data:\r\n```\r\nkey,value\r\n```\r\n3. Create a `enrichments_updated.csv` file with updated enrichment data:\r\n```\r\nkey,updated value\r\n```\r\n4. Create a `summarizer.json` file that will serialize this data as a map in HDFS:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"config\" : {\r\n    \"columns\" : {\r\n      \"key\" : 0,\r\n      \"value\" : 1\r\n    },\r\n    \"state_init\" : \"{}\",\r\n    \"state_update\" : {\r\n      \"state\" : \"MAP_PUT(key, value, state)\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"separator\" : \",\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"extractor\" : \"CSV\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n5. Use the `flatfile_summarizer.sh` script to create serialized files:\r\n```\r\n/usr/metron/0.7.1/bin/flatfile_summarizer.sh -i ./enrichments.csv -o ./enrichments.ser -e summarizer.json -p 1\r\n/usr/metron/0.7.1/bin/flatfile_summarizer.sh -i ./enrichments_updated.csv -o ./enrichments_updated.ser -e summarizer.json -p 1\r\n```\r\n6. Put the first file in HDFS:\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -put enrichments.ser /tmp/enrichments.ser\r\n```\r\n7. Start the Stellar shell and define a field we can use for the enrichments:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 tmp]# /usr/metron/0.7.1/bin/stellar --zookeeper node1:2181\r\nSLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.\r\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/usr/metron/0.7.1/lib/metron-profiler-repl-0.7.1.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/usr/hdp/2.6.5.1050-37/hadoop/lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.10.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\nSLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.\r\nSLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerFactory]\r\nStellar, Go!\r\nFunctions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n{es.clustername=metron, es.ip=node1:9200, es.date.format=yyyy.MM.dd.HH, parser.error.topic=indexing, update.hbase.table=metron_update, update.hbase.cf=t, es.client.settings={}, profiler.client.period.duration=15, profiler.client.period.duration.units=MINUTES, enrichment.list.hbase.provider.impl=org.apache.metron.hbase.HTableProvider, enrichment.list.hbase.table=enrichment_list, enrichment.list.hbase.cf=t, user.settings.hbase.table=user_settings, user.settings.hbase.cf=cf, bootstrap.servers=node1:6667, source.type.field=source:type, threat.triage.score.field=threat:triage:score, enrichment.writer.batchSize=15, enrichment.writer.batchTimeout=0, profiler.writer.batchSize=15, profiler.writer.batchTimeout=0, geo.hdfs.file=/apps/metron/geo/default/GeoLite2-City.tar.gz, asn.hdfs.file=/apps/metron/asn/default/GeoLite2-ASN.tar.gz, object.cache.expiration.minutes=1, in.memory.enrichment.settings={cache.expiration=15, time.unit=SECONDS}}\r\n[Stellar]>>> field := 'key'\r\nkey\r\n```\r\n7. Perform an in-memory enrichment.  There should be a slight delay (for the initial load) but subsequent calls should return immediately:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_IN_MEMORY_GET('/tmp/enrichments.ser', field)\r\nvalue\r\n```\r\n8. The default cache expiration is 24 hours.  Exit the Stellar CLI and set the object cache expiration to 1 minutes in the global config:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"object.cache.expiration.minutes\": 1\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/global/config'\r\n```\r\nNote the `object.cache.expiration.minutes` setting is maintained for backwards compatibility.  You can also set the expiration to 1 minute with these settings:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"object.cache.expiration\": 1,\r\n  \"object.cache.time.unit\": \"MINUTES\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n9. Start the Stellar CLI again and perform the enrichment again.  You should get the same result:\r\n```\r\n[root@node1 tmp]# /usr/metron/0.7.1/bin/stellar --zookeeper node1:2181\r\nSLF4J: Class path contains multiple SLF4J bindings.\r\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/usr/metron/0.7.1/lib/metron-profiler-repl-0.7.1.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\nSLF4J: Found binding in [jar:file:/usr/hdp/2.6.5.1050-37/hadoop/lib/slf4j-log4j12-1.7.10.jar!/org/slf4j/impl/StaticLoggerBinder.class]\r\nSLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#multiple_bindings for an explanation.\r\nSLF4J: Actual binding is of type [org.slf4j.impl.Log4jLoggerFactory]\r\nStellar, Go!\r\nFunctions are loading lazily in the background and will be unavailable until loaded fully.\r\n{es.clustername=metron, es.ip=node1:9200, es.date.format=yyyy.MM.dd.HH, parser.error.topic=indexing, update.hbase.table=metron_update, update.hbase.cf=t, es.client.settings={}, profiler.client.period.duration=15, profiler.client.period.duration.units=MINUTES, enrichment.list.hbase.provider.impl=org.apache.metron.hbase.HTableProvider, enrichment.list.hbase.table=enrichment_list, enrichment.list.hbase.cf=t, user.settings.hbase.table=user_settings, user.settings.hbase.cf=cf, bootstrap.servers=node1:6667, source.type.field=source:type, threat.triage.score.field=threat:triage:score, enrichment.writer.batchSize=15, enrichment.writer.batchTimeout=0, profiler.writer.batchSize=15, profiler.writer.batchTimeout=0, geo.hdfs.file=/apps/metron/geo/default/GeoLite2-City.tar.gz, asn.hdfs.file=/apps/metron/asn/default/GeoLite2-ASN.tar.gz, object.cache.expiration.minutes=1, in.memory.enrichment.settings={cache.expiration=15, time.unit=SECONDS}}\r\n[Stellar]>>> field := 'key'\r\nkey\r\n[Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_IN_MEMORY_GET('/tmp/enrichments.ser', field)\r\nvalue\r\n```\r\n10. In a separate window, upload the updated enrichment file to HDFS:\r\n```\r\nhdfs dfs -put -f /tmp/enrichments_updated.ser /tmp/enrichments.ser\r\n```\r\n11. After a minute the value should change to the value in `enrichments_updated.ser`:\r\n```\r\n[Stellar]>>> ENRICHMENT_IN_MEMORY_GET('/tmp/enrichments.ser', field)\r\nupdated value\r\n```\r\n12. The cache expiration can also be set specifically for `ENRICHMENT_IN_MEMORY_GET`.  Put the previous `enrichments.ser` back in HDFS and change the cache settings to 15 seconds:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n  ...\r\n  \"object.cache.expiration.minutes\": 1,\r\n  \"in.memory.enrichment.settings\": {\r\n    \"cache.expiration\": 15,\r\n    \"time.unit\": \"SECONDS\"\r\n  }\r\n}' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/global/config'\r\n```\r\n13. Perform steps 9 - 11.  Now the value should be updated after 15 seconds.\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\nThis is intended to be a first pass and there are still some outstanding items.  I am planning on adding javadocs and a section in our READMEs describing how to do in-memory enrichments.  \r\n\r\nAre there other features people would like to see added here?  I think it could be useful to set cache settings for each object in HDFS (currently they are global to all objects and can only be changed on initialization).  This would make things more complex and require some design work.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have suggestions for more appropriate function and setting names?\r\n\r\nWhat else would you change about this?\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

PR has been submitted against the `METRON-2088-support-hdp-3.1` feature branch in support of running Metron on an HDP 3.1 cluster.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis change allows the Metron MPack to work with Ambari 2.7.3.0, which is the version of Ambari distributed in HDP 3.1.0.  \r\n\r\nThe change is also backwards compatible with Ambari 2.6.1.0, which is the version of Ambari that we currently install against for HDP 2.6.5.\r\n\r\nThe legacy CentOS 6 image is configured to deploy using Ambari 2.6.1.0 and HDP 2.6.5.\r\n\r\nThe new CentOS 7 image is configured to deploy using Ambari 2.7.3.0 and HDP 3.1.0\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the CentOS 7 development environment. \r\n    * Login to http://node1:8080 with admin/admin and validate that it is Ambari 2.7.3.0\r\n    * Ensure alerts are visible in the Alerts UI\r\n    * Ensure that the Metron Service Check completes successfully.\r\n    ```\r\n   cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n   vagrant up\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n    ![CentOS 7 on Ambari 2 7 3 0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/56991158-01592880-6b65-11e9-939d-7654e5bfa9fa.png)\r\n\r\n    ![HDP 3 1 0 0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2475409/56991177-03bb8280-6b65-11e9-97b9-cee7f92a75eb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Contributor Comments\r\nThis PR fixes a bug in the REST application that fails to convert a parser topology id to a group name when calling the `http://node1:8082/api/v1/storm` endpoint.  The `StormStatusServiceImplTest` was also updated to included this case.  \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis has been tested in full dev:\r\n\r\n1. Spin up full dev and verify data is flowing to Elasticsearch.\r\n2. Define a group name for the OOTB bro, snort, yaf parser topology that is included in full dev:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' -d '{\r\n    \"name\": \"group1\",\r\n    \"description\": \"group1\",\r\n    \"sensors\": [\r\n      \"bro\",\r\n      \"snort\",\r\n      \"yaf\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }' 'http://user:password@node1:8082/api/v1/sensor/parser/group'\r\n```\r\n3. Request a storm status summary for all topologies:\r\n```\r\ncurl -X GET --header 'Accept: application/json' 'http://node1:8082/api/v1/storm'\r\n```\r\nThe `bro__snort__yaf` Storm topology should be returned with the name set to `group1`:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"id\": \"bro__snort__yaf-4-1556557869\",\r\n    \"name\": \"group1\",\r\n    \"status\": \"ACTIVE\",\r\n    \"latency\": 2751.941,\r\n    \"throughput\": 6.045,\r\n    \"emitted\": 3710,\r\n    \"acked\": 3627\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

creates another development environment for CentOS 7.  This work is a prerequisite for supporting HDP 3.1.  This co-exists with the other existing environments.  After some period of time, I see this replacing the CentOS 6 environment.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nThere is currently a bug with the Ubuntu 14 environment in apache/master.   I have created [METRON-2095](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2095) to track the problem.  This prevents me from fully testing the Ubuntu environment.  I have done what I can in this PR to ensure that the Ubuntu environment will continue to work once that bug is addressed. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n1. Launch the CentOS 7 development environment.  \r\n    * Ensure alerts are visible in the Alerts UI\r\n    * Ensure that the Metron Service Check completes successfully.\r\n    ```\r\n   cd metron-deployment/development/centos7\r\n   vagrant up\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Launch the CentOS 6 development environment.  \r\n    * Ensure alerts are visible in the Alerts UI\r\n    * Ensure that the Metron Service Check completes successfully.\r\n    ```\r\n   cd metron-deployment/development/centos6\r\n   vagrant up\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n1. Launch the Ubuntu 14 development environment.  \r\n    * The deployment will *not* complete successfully as you will encounter [METRON-2095](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2095).\r\n    ```\r\n   cd metron-deployment/development/ubuntu14\r\n   vagrant up\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original ASF Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2092\r\n\r\nIssue\r\n====\r\n\r\n> A Grok parser requires a timestampField attribute. Currently the UI allows the user to add a new Grok parser without any timestampField. When you start the parser, nothing happens and there are no error messages.\r\n\r\n> The UI should either default the timestampField attribute to timestamp or pop up an error message when the user tries to save a grok parser with no timestampField attribute.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n=====\r\n\r\n1. Go to metron config\r\n2. Try to add a new sensor which has a Grok parser\r\n3. Make sure the TIMESTAMP field is there\r\n4. It should have the default value `timestamp`\r\n5. Try to remove it completely and save the sensor (you should not be able)\r\n6. Try to save when it has a value `timestamp` or something else (it should work)\r\n\r\nIt should be the same in case of editing the sensor. If there's no timestamp field value, there should be an error message below the input field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nI was able to track this down to a special version of `org.mortbay.jetty` dependencies being pulled in by the `org.apache.storm:storm-hdfs` dependency:  https://community.hortonworks.com/questions/6256/jetty-util-6126hwxjar.html\r\n\r\nThe `org.mortbay.jetty` dependencies are included transitively and the recent metron-writer pom.xml refactor in https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1386 caused this special version to now be included.  This PR fixes this by simply excluding the special version.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nI was able to successfully build full dev and verified data was flowing through to HDFS and ES.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nAdding a loading state to Alerts UI solves the following issues:\r\n\r\n#1\r\n*When*\r\n- clicking on a relatively large meta alert\r\n*Expected*\r\n- to show details on the opening pane (or a loading state)\r\n*Actual*\r\n- user sees a different guid while loading\r\n- then when data arrives screen switching to the details of the actual meta alert\r\n\r\n#2 State retention problem\r\n*When*\r\n- click on an item\r\n- close the Pane\r\n- click on another item\r\n*Expected*\r\n- to see details of the item clicked second\r\n*Actual*\r\n- user sees the details of the previous alert till the details of the item arrive\r\n(in case of meta alerts, this means seconds)\r\n\r\nAs part of this changeset, I aligned the alert details pane's css to the changes in the very similar table config pane. This alignment is just a small but necessary part of the fix.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThis primary purpose of this PR is to remove the Storm dependencies from metron-indexing.  There is a single `HDFSIndexingIntegrationTest` class that requires storm because it tests the Storm HDFS indexing topology.  There are also indexing topology integration tests, flux files and start scripts for Solr and Elasticsearch so the metron-solr and metron-elasticsearch modules were also split into seperate `common` and `storm` modules as well.  The module structure ended up like this:\r\n\r\n- metron-indexing\r\n    - metron-indexing-common (contains everything in legacy metron-indexing except `HDFSIndexingIntegrationTest` \r\n    - metron-indexing-storm (contains the base `IndexingIntegrationTest` along with `HDFSIndexingIntegrationTest`\r\n- metron-elasticsearch\r\n    - metron-elasticsearch-common (contains common ES code including IndexDao implementations)\r\n    - metron-elasticsearch-storm (contains integration tests, flux files and start script)\r\n- metron-solr\r\n    - metron-solr-common (contains common Solr code including IndexDao implementations)\r\n    - metron-solr-storm (contains integration tests, flux files and start script)\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAll unit and integration tests should be passing.  I am in the process of spinning up full dev and validating with [these](https://github.com/apache/metron/pull/1368#issuecomment-477798665) test instructions.  In addition to those instructions I also enabled Solr and ensured:\r\n- Data was being indexed with no errors in the topologies\r\n- Data was visible in the Alerts UI\r\n\r\nI had to use our `$METRON_HOME/bin/install_solr.sh` script because the HDP Search 3 Mpack no longer works.  In this case your Solr zookeeper setting will be different (I believe it's `node1:9983`). \r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nLink to the original ASF Jira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2085\r\n\r\n1. When you click on the name of the meta alert in the detail pane, the input field to change it appears but there's nothing inside but he current meta alert name should be there (because you're changing that). After applying this patch, the user can see the current meta alert name in the input field. \r\n\r\n2. It's impossible to click on the cancel button when it comes to editing the name of the meta alert because an invisible html element covers it (the html element that wraps the close button of the entire pane). After applying this patch the user will be able to click on the cancel button.\r\n\r\nBONUS: I added some keyboard functionalities which means if the user presses enter after updating the meta alert name, it's going to persist the change i.e. save the new name. When the user presses escape button while editing, it means a \"cancel\".\r\n\r\nTest:\r\n\r\n1. Go to the meta alerts list screen\r\n2. Click on an existing meta alert row in order to open the details pane.\r\n3. If you don't have any meta alerts in the list, create one because it has to be a meta alert if you want to add a different name. You cannot rename a regular alert.\r\n4. In the opened pane, at the top, you can click on the current name of the meta alert. It turns into an editable input field where you can change the name.\r\n5. It's quite straightforward to test the functionality based on the summary of the problem in the beginning of the description. Try to rename it and save it by hitting enter or clicking on the check icon on the right. Try to rename it and cancel the process by hitting the escape button or clicking on the cross icon next to the check icon on the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [X] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\n\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/METRON-2071\r\n\r\nAdds 2 new functions, MAP_PUT and MAP_MERGE, to Stellar. I had originally looked at MAP_PUT alone, and when reviewing some of the other data type features such as Sets and Multisets, MAP_MERGE also seemed like a reasonable addition.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\n\r\nI've added pretty extensive unit tests for this, and there are no new dependencies outside of core Java, so I believe manual testing would be optional for this change. If you wish to perform manual validation, spin up full dev (or the Stellar shell in stand-alone mode locally, see https://github.com/apache/metron/tree/master/metron-stellar/stellar-common#stellar-shell-stand-alone) and run through the expressions in the new unit tests for MAP_PUT and MAP_MERGE.\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

Contributor Comments\r\nThe site-book build script at \"site-book/bin/generate-md.sh\" relies on the MacOS version of sed being on the path of the script environment when run under MacOS.  If the GNU version of sed appears earlier in the path then errors will occur during site book construction.\r\n\r\nThis patch forces the build script to use the MacOS version of sed during the regex processing loop. This allows the site book build script to execute successfully when run on a MacOS machine that has GNU sed installed. There are two further calls to sed that remain untouched by this patch as the sed arguments used by the script in these instances are compatible with both versions of sed.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nBuild script runs successfully after patching.  The modified code path is only executed when the script is run under a MacOS environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Pull Request Checklist\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Metron.  \r\nPlease refer to our [Development Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=61332235) for the complete guide to follow for contributions.  \r\nPlease refer also to our [Build Verification Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/METRON/Verifying+Builds?show-miniview) for complete smoke testing guides.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you follow these guidelines and ask you to double check the following:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
