What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a regression in Spark 2.3.\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.2, we have a fragile UI support for SQL data writing commands. We only track the input query plan of `FileFormatWriter` and display its metrics. This is not ideal because we don't know who triggered the writing(can be table insertion, CTAS, etc.), but it's still useful to see the metrics of the input query.\r\n\r\nIn Spark 2.3, we introduced a new mechanism: `DataWritigCommand`, to fix the UI issue entirely. Now these writing commands have real children, and we don't need to hack into the `FileFormatWriter` for the UI. This also helps with `explain`, now `explain` can show the physical plan of the input query, while in 2.2 the physical writing plan is simply `ExecutedCommandExec` and it has no child.\r\n\r\nHowever there is a regression in CTAS. CTAS commands don't extend `DataWritigCommand`, and we don't have the UI hack in `FileFormatWriter` anymore, so the UI for CTAS is just an empty node. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22977 for more information about this UI issue.\r\n\r\nTo fix it, we should apply the `DataWritigCommand` mechanism to CTAS commands.\r\n\r\nTODO: In the future, we should refactor this part and create some physical layer code pieces for data writing, and reuse them in different writing commands. We should have different logical nodes for different operators, even some of them share some same logic, e.g. CTAS, CREATE TABLE, INSERT TABLE.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUse a socket, instead of stdout, as the inter-process communication method between PythonWorkerFactory and a newly launched daemon.py to avoid the issue described in the Jira (a case where python stdout can be polluted by extraneous messages).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- python/run-tests --modules \"pyspark-core,pyspark-sql,pyspark-streaming\"\r\n- python/pyspark/tests.py\r\n- all sbt tests\r\n- selected queries on a Spark cluster that uses a python installation with site customizations\r\n\r\nNote: The two python test scripts and cluster test were run using Python 2.7

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn #19340 some comments considered needed to use spherical KMeans when cosine distance measure is specified, as Matlab does; instead of the implementation based on the behavior of other tools/libraries like Rapidminer, nltk and ELKI, ie. the centroids are computed as the mean of all the points in the clusters.\r\n\r\nThe PR introduce the approach used in spherical KMeans. This behavior has the nice feature to minimize the within-cluster cosine distance.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting/improved

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis issue adds test coverage for ORC configuration with ORC names and Hive names.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n- orc.stripe.size, hive.exec.orc.default.stripe.size\r\n- orc.row.index.stride, hive.exec.orc.default.row.index.stride\r\n- orc.compress.size, hive.exec.orc.default.buffer.size\r\n\r\nNote that these tests are added to both `OrcSourceSuite` and `HiveOrcSourceSuite` because both Spark `native` and `hive` implementation supports them. The followings are the related code.\r\n\r\n- Apache ORC 1.4.1: [OrcConf.java](https://github.com/apache/orc/blob/master/java/core/src/java/org/apache/orc/OrcConf.java#L29)\r\n- Hive 1.2.1:

the keep alive setting is taking effect.\r\n\r\nIt's currently possible to enable TCP keep alive on the worker / executor, but is not possible to configure on other RPC connections. It's unclear to me why this could be the case. Keep alive is more important for the master to protect it against suddenly departing workers / executors, thus I think it's very important to have it. Particularly this makes the master resilient in case of using preemptible worker VMs in GCE. GCE has the concept of shutdown scripts, which it doesn't guarantee to execute. So workers often don't get shutdown gracefully and the TCP connections on the master linger as there's nothing to close them. Thus the need of enabling keep alive.\r\n\r\nThis enables keep-alive on connections besides the master's connections, but that shouldn't cause

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Python 2, when `pandas_udf` tries to return string type value created in the udf with `\"..\"`, the execution fails. E.g.,\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf, col\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\ndf = spark.range(10)\r\nstr_f = pandas_udf(lambda x: pd.Series([\"%s\" % i for i in x]), \"string\")\r\ndf.select(str_f(col('id'))).show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nraises the following exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\r\njava.lang.AssertionError: assertion failed: Invalid schema from pandas_udf: expected StringType, got BinaryType\r\n\tat scala.Predef$.assert(Predef.scala:170)\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.execution.python.ArrowEvalPythonExec$$anon$2.<init>(ArrowEvalPythonExec.scala:93)\r\n\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems like pyarrow ignores `type` parameter for `pa.Array.from_pandas()` and consider it as binary type when the type is string type and the string values are `str` instead of `unicode` in Python 2.\r\n\r\nThis pr adds a workaround for the case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded a test and existing tests.\r\n","created_at":"2018-02-05T10:18:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-06T19:44:41Z","closed_at":"2018-02-06T09:34:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f06f43df8decdf1a79b0b986e558d5e67b1429bc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20507/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20507/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20507/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b3d5209b26322329d7e4ba1fd1b1457f86b44a8a","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-23334","ref":"issues/SPARK-23334","sha":"b3d5209b26322329d7e4ba1fd1b1457f86b44a8a","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

methods of `SQLImplicits` providing Encoders for collections did not check for\r\nEncoders for their elements. This resulted in unrelated error messages during run-time instead of proper failures during compilation.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`Seq`, `Map` and `Set` `Encoder` providers' type parameters and implicit parameters were modified to facilitate the appropriate checks.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this doesn't result in the desired \"Unable to find encoder for type stored in a Dataset\" error as the Scala compiler generates a different error when an implicit cannot be found due to missing arguments (see [ContextErrors](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.12/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/typechecker/ContextErrors.scala#L77)). `@implicitNotFound` is not used in this case.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew behavior:\r\n```\r\nscala> implicitly[Encoder[Map[String, Any]]]\r\n<console>:25: error: diverging implicit expansion for type

[SparkSQLExample](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/425c4ada4c24e338b45d0e9987071f05c5766fa5/examples/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/examples/sql/SparkSQLExample.scala#L223)):\r\n```\r\nscala>

I did not explore this further as it worked everywhere else.","created_at":"2018-02-04T23:17:54Z","updated_at":"2020-03-05T00:12:44Z","closed_at":"2020-03-05T00:12:44Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0c1d1dd0661148092355813bc9cc775c4953b6f1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20505/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20505/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20505/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cd7a1fffb76b7b6e2727bff2219247f868f58565","head":{"label":"michalsenkyr:SPARK-23251","ref":"SPARK-23251","sha":"cd7a1fffb76b7b6e2727bff2219247f868f58565","user":{"login":"michalsenkyr","id":8831737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzE3Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8831737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr","html_url":"https://github.com/michalsenkyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75662732,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTY2MjczMg==","name":"spark","full_name":"michalsenkyr/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"michalsenkyr","id":8831737,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4MzE3Mzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8831737?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr","html_url":"https://github.com/michalsenkyr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michalsenkyr/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/michalsenkyr/spark","description":"Mirror

This is not ideal because this way you will not see the execution if `SparkListenerSQLExecutionStart` event is lost, because `AllExecutionsPage` only read executions from KVStore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAfter the change, the page shows the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to disallow default value None when 'to_replace' is not a dictionary.\r\n\r\nIt seems weird we set the default value of `value` to `None` and we ended up allowing the case as below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> df.show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+----+------+-----+\r\n| age|height| name|\r\n+----+------+-----+\r\n|  10|    80|Alice|\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> df.na.replace('Alice').show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+----+------+----+\r\n| age|height|name|\r\n+----+------+----+\r\n|  10|    80|null|\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\nThis PR targets to disallow the case above:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> df.na.replace('Alice').show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n...\r\nTypeError: value is required when to_replace is not a dictionary.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhile we still allow when `to_replace` is a dictionary:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> df.na.replace({'Alice': None}).show()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n+----+------+----+\r\n| age|height|name|\r\n+----+------+----+\r\n|  10|    80|null|\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested, tests were added in `python/pyspark/sql/tests.py` and doctests were fixed.","created_at":"2018-02-03T18:33:13Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T12:44:03Z","closed_at":"2018-02-09T06:24:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"93e7ddc02494c7b089246a398efee1c152275c0d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20499/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20499/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20499/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/885b4d00af53dfd0148c431fdacce9a2789f32a2","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-19454-followup","ref":"SPARK-19454-followup","sha":"885b4d00af53dfd0148c431fdacce9a2789f32a2","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nDataSourceV2 batch writes should use the output commit coordinator if it is required by the data source. This adds a new method, `DataWriterFactory#useCommitCoordinator`, that determines whether the coordinator will be used. If the write factory returns true, `WriteToDataSourceV2` will use the coordinator for batch writes.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis relies on existing write tests, which now use the commit coordinator.","created_at":"2018-02-02T22:30:09Z","updated_at":"2018-04-27T16:19:21Z","closed_at":"2018-02-13T03:44:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b4dd82f27d37715c05d11530df38debbe5ae5b8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20490/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20490/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20490/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/538bc864f8ebb8d1b7e63c26806f209f2c3b0fc4","head":{"label":"rdblue:SPARK-23323-add-commit-coordinator","ref":"SPARK-23323-add-commit-coordinator","sha":"538bc864f8ebb8d1b7e63c26806f209f2c3b0fc4","user":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":26284539,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNjI4NDUzOQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"rdblue/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rdblue","id":87915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue","html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rdblue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rdblue/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to explicitly specify Pandas and PyArrow versions in PySpark tests to skip or test.\r\n\r\nWe declared the extra dependencies:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b8bfce51abf28c66ba1fc67b0f25fe1617c81025/python/setup.py#L204\r\n\r\nIn case of PyArrow:\r\n\r\nCurrently we only check if pyarrow is installed or not without checking the version. It already fails to run tests. For example, if PyArrow 0.7.0 is installed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n======================================================================\r\nERROR: test_vectorized_udf_wrong_return_type

old Pandas which were tested only when Pandas version was lower, and I rewrote them to be tested when both Pandas version is lower and missing.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in [SPARK-22751](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22751?jql=project%20%3D%20SPARK%20AND%20component%20%3D%20ML%20AND%20text%20~%20randomforest), there is a shuffle performance problem in ML Randomforest when train a RF in high dimensional data. \r\n\r\nThe reason is that, in _org.apache.spark.tree.impl.RandomForest_, the function _findSplitsBySorting_ will actually flatmap a sparse vector into a dense vector, then in groupByKey there will be a huge shuffle write size.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, we can add a filter in flatmap, to filter out zero value. And in function _findSplitsForContinuousFeature_, we can infer the number of zero value by _metadata_.\r\n\r\nIn addition, if a feature only contains zero value, _continuousSplits_ will not has the key of feature id. So I add a check when using _continuousSplits_.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan model locally using spark-submit.","created_at":"2018-02-01T11:18:53Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T14:06:41Z","closed_at":"2018-03-08T14:06:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"49c11bc750c65e99a3a41fb1b27c36b57a18dddf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20472/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20472/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20472/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fea3aad46d1094cf67c2770edab1158b3dece225","head":{"label":"yangz27:master","ref":"master","sha":"fea3aad46d1094cf67c2770edab1158b3dece225","user":{"login":"yangz27","id":8177778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzc3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8177778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27","html_url":"https://github.com/yangz27","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":119681343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTk2ODEzNDM=","name":"spark","full_name":"yangz27/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yangz27","id":8177778,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxNzc3Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8177778?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27","html_url":"https://github.com/yangz27","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yangz27/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yangz27/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSeems R's substr API treats Scala substr API as zero based and so subtracts the given starting position by 1.\r\n\r\nBecause Scala's substr API also accepts zero-based starting position (treated as the first element), so the current R's substr test results are correct as they all use 1 as starting positions.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nModified

the bad news: there's an unfixable race in the launcher code.\r\n(By unfixable I mean it would take a lot more effort than this change\r\nto fix it.) The good news is that it should only affect super short\r\nlived applications, such as the one run by the flaky test, so it's\r\npossible to work around it in our test.\r\n\r\nThe fix also uncovered an issue with the recently added \"closeAndWait()\"\r\nmethod; closing the connection would still possibly cause data loss,\r\nso this change waits a while for the connection to finish itself, and\r\ncloses the socket if that times out. The existing connection timeout\r\nis reused so that if desired it's possible to control how long to wait.\r\n\r\nAs part of that I also restored the old behavior that disconnect() would\r\nforce a disconnection from the child app; the \"wait for data to arrive\"\r\napproach is only taken when disposing of the handle.\r\n\r\nI tested this by inserting a bunch of sleeps in the test and the socket\r\nhandling code in the launcher library; with those I was able to reproduce\r\nthe error from the jenkins jobs. With the changes, even with all the\r\nsleeps still in place, all tests pass.","created_at":"2018-01-31T22:08:48Z","updated_at":"2018-02-06T18:22:36Z","closed_at":"2018-02-02T03:46:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d499588951882d3cf37cde76981c30c6cb943208","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20462/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20462/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20462/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/82c276fa011588448e4c2ec122aac06d0fb02bb6","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-23020","ref":"SPARK-23020","sha":"82c276fa011588448e4c2ec122aac06d0fb02bb6","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nK8s treats CPU as a \"compressible resource\" and can actually assign millicpus to individual containers, e.g., 0.1 (100 millicpus). In https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/resource-managers/kubernetes/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/scheduler/cluster/k8s/ExecutorPodFactory.scala#L94, we already parse `spark.executor.cores` as a double value. This PR enables use of fractional values for `spark.executor.cores`. It also allows fractional values for `spark.task.cpus` correspondingly. The various places where `spark.executor.cores` and `spark.task.cpus` are used are updated to do a conversion from double to integer values. The conversion is needed to not introduce a significant behavioral change to the way the other backends deal with executor cores. The maximum tasks per executor is now calculated as `spark.executor.cores` / `spark.task.cpus` rounded to an integer using the `FLOOR` mode.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual tests.\r\n\r\n@foxish

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFor some ColumnVector get APIs such as getDecimal, getBinary, getStruct, getArray, getInterval, getUTF8String, we should clearly document their behaviors when accessing null slot. They should return null in this case. Then we can remove null checks from the places using above APIs.\r\n\r\nFor the APIs of primitive values like getInt, getInts, etc., this also documents their behaviors when accessing null slots. Their returning values are undefined and can be anything.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests into `ColumnarBatchSuite`.","created_at":"2018-01-31T14:22:17Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:23Z","closed_at":"2018-02-02T02:21:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"173ec96fd1e74afa0e1065a2a70dd70fc6acd321","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20455/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20455/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20455/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6d5f7ec3e6f25e683628370350cfb865aac29d65","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-23272-followup","ref":"SPARK-23272-followup","sha":"6d5f7ec3e6f25e683628370350cfb865aac29d65","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current DataSourceWriter API makes it hard to implement `onTaskCommit(taskCommit: TaskCommitMessage)` in `FileCommitProtocol`.\r\nIn general, on receiving commit message, driver can start processing messages(e.g. persist messages into files) before all the messages are collected.\r\n\r\nThe proposal to add a new API:\r\n`add(WriterCommitMessage message)`:  Handles a commit message on receiving from a successful data writer.\r\n\r\nThis should make the whole API of DataSourceWriter compatible with `FileCommitProtocol`, and more flexible.\r\n\r\nThere was another radical attempt in #20386.  This one should be more reasonable.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-31T12:53:56Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T12:42:21Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T12:42:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a8c993f713b30e90c6770f58ca25f5baaee364c1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4ae9b5e4da575066fc36753793fa6437f18a1ddf","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:write_api","ref":"write_api","sha":"4ae9b5e4da575066fc36753793fa6437f18a1ddf","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19980 , we thought `anyNullsSet` can be simply implemented by `numNulls() > 0`. This is logically true, but may have performance problems.\r\n\r\n`OrcColumnVector` is an example. It doesn't have the `numNulls` property, only has a `noNulls` property.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe changes allow to support Kubernetes resource manager in client mode (upon the existing cluster mode)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe initial changes were done on the latest commits in the spark-k8s fork (https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark) and have been tested on AWS with real data processing.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to merge back the latests features to apache master, I open here untested changes subject to feedback and discussion.\r\n\r\nDocumentation will be updated when code will be discussed, but in the meantime [there is a indigest design document](https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/userdocs/pull/25/files) that can be read to know more about the changes. In- and Out- K8s Cluster considerations, as deps and hdfs access is discussed there.\r\n\r\nUpon the current design and implementation constructs, an open point I have is about the way we wanna configure the path of the k8s config in case of OutCluster mode. Options are:\r\n\r\n1. Force use to specify the path and fail if this property is not given\r\n2. In case of absence of `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` (which is there for InCluster), fall back automatically to the given property, or if no property has been given, fallback to the `$HOME/.kube/config` (in this latter case, there is no separate cacert nor keyfile, those details are all bundled in the single `$HOME/.kube/config` file).\r\n\r\nThe tests so far have been done with separated config, cacert and key files (I guess the single config file should not give any issue).\r\n\r\nA last important point is how we move forward with this for the merge. To have a client mode better coverage, it would be interesting to have also downstream https://github.com/apache-spark-on-k8s/spark/pull/540 which is not only Kerberos, but also the Hadoop steps much needed to mount Hadoop conf to connect HDFS from Driver/Executors.\r\n\r\nAlso to avoid mess in future merge, I list here the changes I had to deal with applying the patch on the apache master repo:\r\n\r\n+ submitsteps package is steps\r\n+ no OptionRequirements class (used in SparkKubernetesClientFactory)\r\n+ no ExecutorLocalDirVolumeProvider in ExecutorPodFactory\r\n+ no APISERVER_AUTH_DRIVER_MOUNTED_CONF_PREFIX in config.scala\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFill the last missing piece of `ColumnVector`: the map type support.\r\n\r\nThe idea is similar to the array type support. A map is basically 2 arrays: keys and values. We ask the implementations to provide a key array, a value array, and an offset and length to specify the range of this map in the key/value array.\r\n\r\nIn `WritableColumnVector`, we put the key array in first child vector, and value array in second child vector, and offsets and lengths in the current vector, which is very similar to how array type is implemented here.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is inspired by https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20387, but only focus on making the plan immutable.\r\n\r\nThe idea is simple, instead of keeping the mutable `DataSourceReader` in the plan, we should keep `DataSourceV2`, and create the reader when needed. The pushdown information will be stored in the plan, instead of relying on the mutable reader.\r\n\r\nThis can also help us removing 2 unnecessary APIs from `SupportsPushDownCatalystFilters` and `SupportsPushDownFilters`.\r\n\r\nSince in this PR we add a lot of new parameters to `DataSourceRelation`, the explain result of this plan becomes a little messy, I cleaned it up a little, now the explain looks like\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\nRelation SimpleDataSourceV2[i#0, j#1]\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\ni: int, j: int\r\nRelation SimpleDataSourceV2[i#0, j#1]\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nRelation SimpleDataSourceV2[i#0, j#1]\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Scan SimpleDataSourceV2[i#0, j#1]\r\n```\r\n--------\r\n```\r\n== Parsed Logical Plan ==\r\n'Filter ('i > 6)\r\n+- AnalysisBarrier\r\n      +- Project [j#78]\r\n         +- Relation JavaAdvancedDataSourceV2[i#77, j#78] ()\r\n\r\n== Analyzed Logical Plan ==\r\nj: int\r\nProject [j#78]\r\n+- Filter (i#77 > 6)\r\n   +- Project [j#78, i#77]\r\n      +- Relation JavaAdvancedDataSourceV2[i#77, j#78] ()\r\n\r\n== Optimized Logical Plan ==\r\nRelation JavaAdvancedDataSourceV2[j#78] (PushedFilter: [isnotnull(i#77), (i#77 > 6)])\r\n\r\n== Physical Plan ==\r\n*(1) Scan JavaAdvancedDataSourceV2[j#78] (PushedFilter: [isnotnull(i#77), (i#77 > 6)])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI improved the test in `DataSourceV2Suite`, to make sure this new change doesn't break the column pruning and filter push down.","created_at":"2018-01-31T04:47:07Z","updated_at":"2018-02-06T05:53:35Z","closed_at":"2018-02-06T05:53:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9bc24087db3fd19774c76ca1c08bae4bd7235384","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20448/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20448/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20448/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/11220db7879798967cda85d2aa4e68fefb8ec646","head":{"label":"cloud-fan:immutable-plan","ref":"immutable-plan","sha":"11220db7879798967cda85d2aa4e68fefb8ec646","user":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19689699,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTY4OTY5OQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"cloud-fan/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cloud-fan","id":3182036,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxODIwMzY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3182036?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan","html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cloud-fan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cloud-fan/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhive tests have been failing when they are run locally (Mac Os) after a recent change in the trunk. After running the tests for some time, the test fails with OOM with Error: unable to create new native thread.\r\n\r\nI noticed the thread count goes all the way up to 2000+ after which we start getting these OOM errors. Most of the threads seem to be related to the connection pool in hive metastore (BoneCP-xxxxx-xxxx ). This behaviour change is happening after we made the following change to HiveClientImpl.reset()\r\n\r\n``` SQL\r\n def reset(): Unit = withHiveState {\r\n    try {\r\n      // code\r\n    } finally {\r\n      runSqlHive(\"USE default\")  ===> this is causing the issue\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nI am proposing to temporarily back-out part of a fix made to address SPARK-23000 to resolve this issue while we work-out the exact reason for this sudden increase in thread counts.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRan hive/test multiple times in different machines.\r\n\r\n(If this patch involves UI changes, please attach a screenshot; otherwise, remove this)\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-30T19:51:09Z","updated_at":"2018-02-09T21:23:07Z","closed_at":"2018-01-30T22:14:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"338ce3536e5ffedb421fd9f63e0a883f51560548","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20441/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20441/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20441/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/983aa1839e6991b72f02639e0bd5355200da1d47","head":{"label":"dilipbiswal:hive_tests","ref":"hive_tests","sha":"983aa1839e6991b72f02639e0bd5355200da1d47","user":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42921897,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjkyMTg5Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"dilipbiswal/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dilipbiswal","id":14225158,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1MTU4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225158?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal","html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dilipbiswal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dilipbiswal/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ColumnVector` is aimed to support all the data types, but `CalendarIntervalType` is missing. Actually we do support interval type for inner fields, e.g. `ColumnarRow`, `ColumnarArray` both support interval type. It's weird if we don't support interval type at the top level.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the interval type support.\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes `ColumnVector.getChild` protect. We need it public because `MutableColumnaRow.getInterval` needs it. Now the interval implementation is in `ColumnVector.getInterval`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\na new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n1. create a new package for partitioning/distribution related classes.\r\n    As Spark will add new concrete implementations of `Distribution` in new releases, it is good to \r\n    have a new package for partitioning/distribution related classes.\r\n\r\n2. move streaming related class to package `org.apache.spark.sql.sources.v2.reader/writer.streaming`, instead of `org.apache.spark.sql.sources.v2.streaming.reader/writer`.\r\nSo that the there won't be package reader/writer inside package streaming, which is quite confusing.\r\nBefore change:\r\n```\r\nv2\r\n├── reader\r\n├── streaming\r\n│   ├── reader\r\n│   └── writer\r\n└── writer\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter change:\r\n```\r\nv2\r\n├── reader\r\n│   └── streaming\r\n└── writer\r\n    └── streaming\r\n```\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit test.\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-30T09:41:12Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T04:37:04Z","closed_at":"2018-02-01T04:37:04Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb3d63ddfd64a4f86ea807a621ca3c1956cadafb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20435/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20435/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20435/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1d90cf11710e452c5b2adf819da8003c8f96c6e1","head":{"label":"gengliangwang:new_pkg","ref":"new_pkg","sha":"1d90cf11710e452c5b2adf819da8003c8f96c6e1","user":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":95047635,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NTA0NzYzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"gengliangwang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gengliangwang","id":1097932,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTc5MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1097932?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gengliangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gengliangwang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nStill saw the performance regression introduced by `spark.sql.codegen.hugeMethodLimit` in our internal workloads. There are two major issues in the current solution.\r\n- The size of the complied byte code is not identical to the bytecode size of the method. The detection is still not accurate. \r\n- The bytecode size of a single operator (e.g., `SerializeFromObject`) could still exceed 8K limit. We saw the performance regression in such scenario. \r\n\r\nSince it is close to the release of 2.3, we decide to increase it to 64K for avoiding the perf regression.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nN/A","created_at":"2018-01-30T08:41:57Z","updated_at":"2018-01-30T19:36:25Z","closed_at":"2018-01-30T19:36:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bda6d3d5827b9de92af4285661642919e9c445be","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20434/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20434/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20434/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c64bdfa919cbb61cef636519673d780a2f2b6923","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:revertConf","ref":"revertConf","sha":"c64bdfa919cbb61cef636519673d780a2f2b6923","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr updated parsing rules in `SqlBase.g4` to support a SQL query below when ANSI mode enabled;\r\n```\r\nSELECT CAST('2017-08-04' AS DATE) + 1 days;\r\n```\r\nThe current master cannot parse it though, other dbms-like systems support the syntax (e.g., hive and mysql). Also, the syntax is frequently used in the official TPC-DS queries.\r\n\r\nThis pr added new tokens as follows;\r\n```\r\nYEAR | YEARS | MONTH | MONTHS | WEEK | WEEKS | DAY | DAYS | HOUR | HOURS | MINUTE \r\nMINUTES | SECOND | SECONDS | MILLISECOND | MILLISECONDS | MICROSECOND | MICROSECONDS\r\n```\r\nThen, it registered the keywords below as the ANSI reserved (this follows SQL-2011);\r\n```\r\n DAY | HOUR | MINUTE | MONTH | SECOND | YEAR\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded tests in `SQLQuerySuite`, `ExpressionParserSuite`, and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIt is reported that the test `Cancelling stage in a query with Range` in `DataFrameRangeSuite` fails a few times in unrelated PRs. I personally also saw it too in my PR.\r\n\r\nThis test is not very flaky actually but only fails occasionally. Based on how the test works, I guess that is because `range` finishes before the listener calls `cancelStage`.\r\n\r\nI increase the range number from `1000000000L` to `100000000000L` and count the range in one partition. I also reduce the `interval` of checking stage id. Hopefully it can make the test not flaky anymore.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe modified tests.","created_at":"2018-01-30T06:06:02Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:21:22Z","closed_at":"2018-01-30T13:03:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a83d367ec3cdb9b38d985275884f024196f90c7b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20431/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/20431/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/20431/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9a4a4842b3f8281e73e564f4dfdad92017630760","head":{"label":"viirya:SPARK-23222","ref":"SPARK-23222","sha":"9a4a4842b3f8281e73e564f4dfdad92017630760","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAll other classes in the reader/writer package doesn't have `V2` in their names, and the streaming reader/writer don't have `V2` either. It's more consistent to remove `V2` from `DataSourceV2Reader` and `DataSourceVWriter`.\r\n\r\nAlso rename `DataSourceV2Option` to remote the `V2`, we should only have `V2` in the root interface: `DataSourceV2`.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes some places that the mix-in interface doesn't extend the interface it aimed to mix in.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nexisting
