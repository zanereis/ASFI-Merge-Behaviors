of https://github.com/dmlc/mxnet/pull/3952\r\n\r\n1. Fix the argument of dot and batch_dot\r\n2. New operators: topk, sort, argsort, arange. (Also, the previous internal operators _zeros and _ones have been added to the python script as mx.sym.zeros and mx.sym.ones)\r\n3. Move operator to operator/tensor: BlockGrad\r\n4. Add the argument dtype to initialization operators (_zeros, _ones, _arange)\r\n5. Enable gradient for `argmax` and `argmin` by adding the gradient node to `_zeros`.\r\n\r\nSome Notes:\r\n\r\nThe implementation of TopK is not so optimized at this stage. The implementation is to first sort the data and then keep the top k indices/values. Also, the \"axis\" argument is supported in topk and topk is equivalent to argsort and sort if we set \"k<1\" and ret_typ = \"indices\" or \"value\"\r\n\r\nThe arange operator has an additional \"repeat\" argument, which indicates the number of times each element will be repeated in the generation process.","created_at":"2016-12-01T07:36:14Z","updated_at":"2017-01-08T04:49:26Z","closed_at":"2016-12-10T10:32:45Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6bcb8ab6c0c6481a7483ab1a2901b6ebae8181e6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4047/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4047/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4047/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/de56121e548063713a930ce9ffc003b16e360505","head":{"label":"sxjscience:topk_and_arange_after_rebase","ref":"topk_and_arange_after_rebase","sha":"de56121e548063713a930ce9ffc003b16e360505","user":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44923569,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDkyMzU2OQ==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"sxjscience/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sxjscience","id":5178350,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxNzgzNTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5178350?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience","html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sxjscience/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sxjscience/mxnet","description":"

Enable gradient for `argmax` and `argmin` by adding the gradient node to `_zeros`.\r\n\r\nSome Notes:\r\n\r\nThe implementation of TopK is not so optimized at this stage. The implementation is to first sort the data and then keep the top k indices/values. Also, the \"axis\" argument is supported in topk and topk is equivalent to argsort and sort if we set \"k<1\" and ret_typ = \"indices\" or \"value\"\r\n\r\nThe arange operator has an additional \"repeat\" argument, which indicates the number of times each element will be repeated in the generation
