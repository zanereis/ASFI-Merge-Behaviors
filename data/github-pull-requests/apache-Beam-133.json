adds a docker based build environment intended for developers to have a predictable working environment with all needed tools present.\r\n\r\nOn a Linux machine (I ONLY tested this on my Ubuntu 20.04 laptop) just run the `start-build-env.sh` script to build and start a Docker based build setup that wraps around the current source tree beam copy.\r\n\r\nThis is based upon the initiative started by @omarismail94 #12837 and copies large parts from https://github.com/apache/hadoop \r\n\r\nAs suggested by @TheNeuralBit in #12837 I was able to run `./gradlew :sdks:python:container:py37:docker`

introduces a bug where the algorithm that determines the parents of fused stage can create loops, because the lowest common ancestor algorithm considers a transform to be its own parent. Fusing a single transform A will result cause the fused stage's parent to be set to A. Fusing a transform A with a descendant B will also cause fused stage's parent to be set to A. To fix this, if the parent of the fused stage would be one of transforms to be fused, set the parent to the parent of that transform instead.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

adding a line to establish expectations will mean more people are willing to vote.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure how to word it in a formal way, but the intent I was going for is: \"if your own use case works, that's enough to leave +1\". The point here is to counter overly high expectations, like that +1s are only worth leaving if everything is confirmed to work, or that you need to personally test the release to leave a +1 (if someone else tested your use case and it works, that should be enough).\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

this change checks whether a tag exists before calling the gradle release plugin, allowing the user to either delete the existing tag or skip creating the tag. Also avoids going into interactive commit messages with SVN, instead using commit messages built-in to the script.\r\n\r\nNote that the original intention behind this change is to allow finer-grained skipping in the release candidate script to avoid problems if steps need to be repeated if a release candidate fails. For example, in the current implementation if a release candidate fails after creating a release candidate tag and that step gets run again, it'll cause an error due to trying to create an existing tag. I tried to read through the script to find other instances where repeating a step might be problematic, but I couldn't really find anything else that isn't already skippable. Reviewers, let me know if I missed any.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is an implementation of the following proposal: https://s.apache.org/get-metrics-api. The ultimate goal is to offer a way to query user metrics after a job. The API follows the design of existing APIs in Python and Java SDKs.\r\n\r\nHow it works from user's perspective:\r\n```go\r\nresult, _ := beamx.RunPipelineWithMetrics(ctx, p)\r\nqueryResult := result.Metrics().Query()\r\nfmt.Println(queryResult.GetCounters())\r\nfmt.Println(queryResult.GetDistributions())\r\nfmt.Println(queryResult.GetGauges())\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn example of output:\r\n```\r\n[{1 1 {fn/read/n2/SplitAndSize0:0  }} {20000 20000 {main.counterOperationFn counter-0 counterOperationFn}} {1 1 {fn/read/n1:0  }}]\r\n[]\r\n[]\r\n```\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

wrappers around each test xlang transform used in the examples, which show how xlang transforms are best implemented. Also adjusts the xlang fronte-end, specifically removing the misleadingly named Sink and Source versions of the methods, and adjusting the Input/Output tag naming to match and adding some helpers.\r\n\r\nNote: Currently the CoGroupByKey, Partition, and MultiInputOutput examples are failing when run manually, however that seems unrelated to this PR. They fail identically if I run them in a clean repo. Still debugging that issue.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

`fasterCopy` option, removes an unnecessary deep copy in the Flink runner between each operator. This should lead to improved performance in all cases. The Jira issue has more info.\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to Beam and I just did what I thought was right. The biggest issue here was to get pipeline options into the `CoderTypeSerializer`. I tried my best, but welcome any feedback!\r\n\r\nOne thing I am not quite sure how to do is test this. Should all flink tests be ran twice with this option toggled? All tests pass with the change in `CoderTypeSerializer` applied, but I've not tried all of them with the flag enabled. How would one go about this?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

team,\r\n\r\nThis is a doc only change to update the deprecated (since 2.25.0) `BigQuerySource` to the new `ReadFromBigQuery`.\r\n\r\nAs this is my first contribution, I am not sure if I need to also create a JIRA ticket along with doc only changes. If needed, I can create a ticket later on.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBin\r\n\r\nPS:  I noticed that that the old API is also still used in other places in the codebase 1) integration test codes 2) example/cookbook pipelines. I wonder if I should also update those to the new API?\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

users are debugging beam, often times there are filters on log severity level that make it easier to look at details that threw errors. In many pipeline, BigQuery insertAll errors get missed because they are reported as INFO, and a good handful of users end up having to enable INFO level logging in order to see errors. Since BigQuery insertAll errors often times can lead to the pipeline being stuck for hours, being able to log this at the WARNING level would make this easier for debugging and monitoring.

PR:\r\n- updates Hadoop dependencies from 2.8.5 to 2.10.1\r\n- adds tests for Hadoop 2.8.5 compatibility in modules that have hadoop dependencies as 'provided'\r\n\r\nFor the tests I've taken the approach that is already used in KafkaIO.\r\n\r\nI tried to add tests for Hadoop 2.7.7 but without success. I haven't verified if the problem comes from tests configuration or the IO itself but since this PR is to assure the compatibility with the previous version used in Beam (2.8.5) I'd like not to touch it. It could be worth to file a Jira to add tests for 2.7.7 version.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

py bundle finalization test is flaky on Flink since  Flink checkpointing may not happen right before the pipeline finishes. We can rewrite the test to use SDF initiated checkpoint to force bundle finalization happens.

This has a couple of benefits:\r\n- It's more helpful for our users, directing them to BEAM-9547\r\n- Reduces the number of failing tests, getting us closer to running this continuously\r\n- It gives us a frequency count for unimplemented methods in the user guide test:\r\n\r\n```\r\n4619 total test cases:\r\n  0 skipped (0.0%)\r\n  784 NotImplementedError (17.0%)\r\n    223 NameError following NotImplementedError (28.4%)\r\n    26 'resample' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (3.3%)\r\n    24 'rolling' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (3.1%)\r\n    22 'cat' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (2.8%)\r\n    22 'apply' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (2.8%)\r\n    21 'loc' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (2.7%)\r\n    20 'reindex' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (2.6%)\r\n    19 'dt' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (2.4%)\r\n    17 'interpolate' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (2.2%)\r\n    16 'sort_index' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (2.0%)\r\n    16 'loc.setitem' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (2.0%)\r\n    15 'iloc' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (1.9%)\r\n    13 'mean' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (1.7%)\r\n    13 '__getitem__' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (1.7%)\r\n    12 GroupBy.agg currently only supports callable arguments (1.5%)\r\n    11 'ndim' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (1.4%)\r\n    11 'describe' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (1.4%)\r\n    11 'sample' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (1.4%)\r\n    9 <class 'str'> (1.1%)\r\n    9 'duplicated' is not yet supported (BEAM-9547) (1.1%)\r\n\r\n<omitted for brevity>\r\n\r\n  432 apache_beam.dataframe.frame_base.WontImplementError (9.4%)\r\n    190 NameError following apache_beam.dataframe.frame_base.WontImplementError (44.0%)\r\n    65 order-sensitive (15.0%)\r\n    35 non-deferred (8.1%)\r\n    30 non-deferred value (6.9%)\r\n    26 order sensitive (6.0%)\r\n    22 Conversion to a non-deferred a numpy array.

used for the state namespace.\r\n\r\nPreviously prefetching was fetching non-existent state, possibly adding\r\nunnecessary fetches as well as neglecting to prefetch actual state used.\r\n\r\nAnother way to accomplish this would be to change the TriggerStateMachine\r\nprefetch methods to take a TriggerContext instead of a raw state accessor.\r\nThis would allow for TriggerStateMachine to get the correct state for\r\nsubtriggers.  That seems more inline with how the nonprefetch methods work\r\nhowever that is a public interface change.\r\n\r\n**Please** add a meaningful description for your change here\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
