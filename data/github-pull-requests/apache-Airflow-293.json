Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- My PR does not have a JIRA.  I don't have a JIRA account to file the extremely problematic issue we came across when using Airflow with Amazon Redshift, so maybe this won't get merged, but maybe the next guy will find it with google.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] When running long running queries in Amazon with `PostgresHook`, we had an interesting result.  Any query over 300 seconds would appear to Airflow as \"hanging\" for exactly 120 minutes, and then the task would fail.  So from the 5 minute mark to the 2 hour mark, stuff would just be stuck.\r\n\r\nAfter a ton of testing and poking and prodding deep with the recesses of [the documentation of the `psycopg2` driver and `libpq-connect`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/libpq-connect.html), we discovered the `keepalives_idle` setting.  When we set that to less than 300 seconds in the connection string, voila, victory.  We currently use 180 to play nice with redshift.\r\n\r\n0, the default set here, means \"use the system setting\" (according to [the driver docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/libpq-connect.html))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] This does not require more tests because it is just adding a `libpq` option to the driver.  Cannot think of a way to test this.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits do not JIRA issues in their subject lines. \r\n- [x] You can squash + merge.  I tried to squash into one commit and ended up with several.  oh well.\r\n- [x] In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-11T07:56:56Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T23:50:55Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T23:50:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"452ca3924ae18b0b68064403eb4b316f5946facf","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-10T00:52:18Z","updated_at":"2017-08-11T00:26:46Z","closed_at":"2017-08-11T00:26:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d286268ef999fa04bedd86b02fc4edb707e26ccc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2510/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2510/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2510/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/d8040e1537d67eabe251f7aeebce15f8103a41c1","head":{"label":"edgarRd:erod-error-handling-var-decrypt","ref":"erod-error-handling-var-decrypt","sha":"d8040e1537d67eabe251f7aeebce15f8103a41c1","user":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96826716,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjgyNjcxNg==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"edgarRd/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1420\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1473\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n    - Modify the deadlock check to flag task upstream conditions before assuming that a task is unrunnable. This resolves a deadlock false positive case where having a `ONE_FAILED` task mid-pipeline can cause the remainder of a pipeline to abort, even if a later `ALL_DONE` might be able to continue were the `ONE_FAILED` to be skipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n    - A test has been added for the interaction between `TriggerRule.ONE_FAILED` and the DagRun deadlock check.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

allows one to wait on any valid combination of\r\n`(dag_id, task_id)`. However, when you have multiple teams, each owning\r\nmultiple small-to-medium sized DAGs, it is desirable to be able to wait\r\non entire `DagRun`s, as opposed to specific task instances in those\r\nDAGs.  This has the advantage of freeing up the owners of upstream DAGs\r\nto refactor their DAGs without worrying about breaking dependent DAGs.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new sensor operator in contrib, called `DagRunSensor`,\r\nwhich has an interface similar to `ExternalTaskSensor`, except that it\r\ndoes not take an `external_task_id` to wait on.\r\n\r\nDear Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1488] Add the DagRunSensor operator.\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1488\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `ExternalTaskSensor` operator already allows for encoding dependencies on tasks in external DAGs. However, when you have teams, each owning multiple small-to-medium sized DAGs, it is desirable to be able to wait on an external DagRun as a whole. This allows the owners of an upstream DAG to refactor their code freely by splitting/squashing task responsibilities, without worrying about dependent DAGs breaking.\r\n\r\nI'll now enumerate the easiest ways of achieving this that come to mind:\r\n\r\n- Make all DAGs always have a join DummyOperator in the end, with a task id that follows some convention, e.g., `\"{{ dag_id }}.__end__\"`.\r\n- Make ExternalTaskSensor poke for a DagRun instead of TaskInstances when the external_task_id argument is None.\r\n- Implement a separate DagRunSensor operator.\r\n\r\nAfter considerations, we decided to implement a separate operator, which we've been using in the team for our workflows, and I think it would make a good addition to contrib.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n- tests/contrib/operators/test_dagrun_sensor.py\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-08-06T12:53:56Z","updated_at":"2018-12-17T23:50:55Z","closed_at":"2018-12-17T23:50:55Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d5c4e25d1be1747ab400e399cb1c597831150ce8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1053368536,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDUzMzY4NTM2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"e8b955","default":false,"description":"Stale

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1483] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1483\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nViews showing model listings had large page sizes which made page\r\nloading really slow client-side, mostly due to DOM processing and\r\nJS plugin rendering.\r\nAlso, the page size was inconsistent across some listings.\r\n\r\nThis commit introduces a configurable page size, and by default\r\nit'll use a page_size = 100. Also, the same page size is applied to\r\nall the model views controlled by flask_admin to be consistent.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThis is a fairly simple change but verified manually that the configured page size is being used.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow 1239](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1239) issue and references it in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe details here are that there exists a PR for this JIRA already, [PR 2318](https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/2318), but like @AllisonWang mentioned in the comments, it doesn't address the root cause of the issue. The issue is that in python 2.7 not all literals are automatically unicode like they are in python 3. That's what's the root cause, and that can simply be fixed by just explicitly stating all literals should be treated as unicode, which is an import from the `__future__` module. There is a [stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3235386/python-using-format-on-a-unicode-escaped-string) that also explains this same solution, which I found helpful.\r\nThe reason I created a new PR is that the original person working on this ticket seemed to be unresponsive to comments, and I would like to work on getting this fix in.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nI am going to add some code snippets for before and after adding this import:\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n```\r\n[2017-07-28 23:03:03,358] {driver.py:120} INFO - Generating grammar tables from /usr/lib/python2.7/lib2to3/PatternGrammar.txt\r\nException in thread Thread-1:\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 810, in __bootstrap_inner\r\n    self.run()\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python2.7/threading.py\", line 763, in run\r\n    self.__target(*self.__args, **self.__kwargs)\r\n  File \"/home/ahaidrey/.virtualenvs/airflow/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/airflow/task_runner/base_task_runner.py\", line 95, in _read_task_logs\r\n    self.logger.info('Subtask: {}'.format(line.rstrip('\\n')))\r\nUnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\u2018' in position 66: ordinal not in range(128)\r\n```\r\n**After**\r\n```\r\n[2017-07-29 03:57:05,707] {__init__.py:57} INFO - Using executor CeleryExecutor\r\n[2017-07-29 03:57:05,833] {driver.py:120} INFO - Generating grammar tables from /usr/lib/python2.7/lib2to3/Grammar.txt\r\n[2017-07-29 03:57:05,879] {driver.py:120} INFO - Generating grammar tables from /usr/lib/python2.7/lib2to3/PatternGrammar.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a BashSensor operator, which succeeds once a bash command/script returns 0, and keeps poking otherwise. It allows the user to easily construct dag's that wait for events with custom logic.\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1470) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nThe implementation of the poke method is very similar to the execute method of the BashOperator.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n* The class _BashSensorTests_ was added, which can be executed directly with ```nosetests tests.contrib.sensors.test_bash_sensor```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1460\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n  Remove \"REMOVED\" task instances from the airflow metadata db. This is necessary to avoid task instances being forever stuck in a \"REMOVED\" limbo should the old task show up again\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nTests that \"REMOVED\" task instances are removed (reset to None)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-25T19:00:27Z","updated_at":"2018-08-07T22:18:54Z","closed_at":"2018-08-07T22:18:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b83828200efc8465801f3999e3408476fd04cbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2482/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2482/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2482/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/1dfeefbe0eeb8a41e15d43d82ccbe27f49c10540","head":{"label":"CloverHealth:af1460_fix_removed","ref":"af1460_fix_removed","sha":"1dfeefbe0eeb8a41e15d43d82ccbe27f49c10540","user":{"login":"CloverHealth","id":8988137,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg5ODgxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8988137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth","html_url":"https://github.com/CloverHealth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44642707,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDY0MjcwNw==","name":"airflow","full_name":"CloverHealth/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CloverHealth","id":8988137,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjg5ODgxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8988137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth","html_url":"https://github.com/CloverHealth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CloverHealth/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CloverHealth/airflow","description":"Airflow

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n  - [AIRFLOW-1852](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-185)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis makes running Airflow tremendously easier in common\r\nproduction deployments that need a little more than just\r\na bare `socket.getfqdn()` hostname for service discovery\r\nper running instance.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I just place the Kubernetes Pod FQDN (or even IP) here.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Since the web server calls out to the individual\r\nworker nodes to snag logs, what happens if one dies midway?\r\nI may later look into that, because that scares me slightly.\r\nI feel like workers should not ever hold such state, but that's purely a personal bias.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nThe tests are already here to test the functionality of what's being done.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n* Github offers a really nice squash button when you go to merge for this reason that doesn't require a contributor to destroy their own history, but, I have done as

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow-1325](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1325) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nPlease refer to [Airflow-1325](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1325) for more details. Highlights of this change include:\r\n- Enable ElasticSearch as Airflow logging backend\r\n- Real-time auto-tailing streaming log\r\n- Log syntax highlighting with Highlight.js and webworker (this will be included in the subsequent PR but not this one)\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2017-07-21 at 2 16 27 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5182499/28483467-419190aa-6e22-11e7-89bc-20495a576079.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR will solve the problem of loading big log files that freeze the browser. Instead of loading entire log files when the page renders, webserver will read and render logs by batch. \r\nNote this PR develop on top of changes in #2464. \r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - Unit test for helper functions\r\n  - Test on local environment with docker ElasticSearch, Logstash and Filebeat pipeline (v5.4.0) \r\n  - Test on production environment with ElasticSearch and Logstash cluster\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1441) issues and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1441\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe recap code is updated to say:\r\n```\r\nCode that goes along with the Airflow tutorial located at:\r\nhttps://github.com/airbnb/airflow/blob/master/airflow/example_dags/tutorial.py\r\n```\r\nto match the initial code.\r\n\r\nThe initial code's DAG definition is updated to say:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndag = DAG(\r\n    'tutorial', default_args=default_args, schedule_interval=timedelta(1))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes the two sections consistent.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nSince this is only a small documentation consistency update, I have not added any unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses [Airflow 1385](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1385) and references them in the PR title. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds configurable task logging to Airflow. Please refer to #2422 for previous discussions. This is the first step of making entire Airflow logging configurable ([AIRFLOW-1454](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1454)).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nFileTaskHandler is tested locally and in staging. S3TaskHandler is tested in staging. GCSTaskHandler is not tested. \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1349] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1349\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBackfillJob._execute is doing multiple things - it is pretty hard to\r\nfollow and maintain.\r\n\r\nChanges included are just a re-org of the code, no logic has been\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nRefactor includes:\r\n- Break BackfillJob._execute into functions\r\n- Add a Status object to track BackfillJob internal status while\r\n  executing the job.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n`BackfillJobTest.test_backfill_max_limit_check*`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-21T02:04:32Z","updated_at":"2017-07-28T22:51:08Z","closed_at":"2017-07-28T22:51:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e594c21d70c6d130623a6e19b7894ec9d73bfdf0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2463/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2463/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2463/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/cf4dc3c0531fb2d1c23986a9fd46538ebcd244fb","head":{"label":"edgarRd:erod-backfill-refactor","ref":"erod-backfill-refactor","sha":"cf4dc3c0531fb2d1c23986a9fd46538ebcd244fb","user":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96826716,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjgyNjcxNg==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"edgarRd/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-18T21:14:15Z","updated_at":"2017-07-20T20:32:11Z","closed_at":"2017-07-20T20:32:11Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a1d9be09aa43836bc5afe0cb5208e06c46211a66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2457/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2457/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2457/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/c0a19f2efdb046bd880bfccad7fc13bbac98f48f","head":{"label":"numberly:jira_1424","ref":"jira_1424","sha":"c0a19f2efdb046bd880bfccad7fc13bbac98f48f","user":{"login":"numberly","id":5330219,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjUzMzAyMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5330219?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly","html_url":"https://github.com/numberly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/numberly/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"751e936ac2d18aec0315d2ed4f307c6b04ea431e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33884891,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzg4NDg5MQ==","name":"airflow","full_name":"apache/airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1349\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nBefore, if a backfill job was triggered that would include a dag run\r\nalready in a RUNNING state, the dag run within the backfill would be\r\nincluded in the count agains the max_active_runs limit. Also, if a\r\nbackfill job generated multiple dag runs it could potentially\r\nviolate max_active_runs limits by executing all dag runs.\r\n\r\nNow the limit is checked per dag run to be created, and the backfill job\r\nwill only run the dag runs within the backfill job that could be\r\nincluded within the limits.\r\nAlso, if the max_active_runs limit has already been reached, the\r\nBackfillJob will wait and loop trying to create the required dag runs as\r\nsoon as a dag run slot within the limit is available until all dag runs\r\nare completed.\r\n\r\nThese changes provide a more consistent behavior according to the\r\nmax_active_runs limits definition and allows the user to run backfill\r\njobs with existing RUNNING state when already considered within the\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n  - `BackfillJobTest.test_backfill_max_limit_check*`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-17T23:17:13Z","updated_at":"2017-08-04T21:10:08Z","closed_at":"2017-08-04T21:10:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d6bcb5752b614f7e6b686757d9f5a5edcf3fe967","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2454/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2454/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2454/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/f3727a08733d292234dfceae534ba825e53e939b","head":{"label":"edgarRd:erod-fix-backfill-max","ref":"erod-fix-backfill-max","sha":"f3727a08733d292234dfceae534ba825e53e939b","user":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96826716,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjgyNjcxNg==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"edgarRd/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"edgarRd","id":266670,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2NjY3MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/266670?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd","html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/edgarRd/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/edgarRd/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1422) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1422] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1422\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] # Allow log files generated by the scheduler, webserver and workers be more organized based on time interval, size etc.   Make it easier for analysis, maintenance and cleanup. \r\n- [x] # Log Handler - it supports all file handlers:  TimedRotatingFileHandler, RotatingFileHandler, WatchedFileHandler, FileHandler or StreamHandler.  \r\n- [x] #Two configuration keys are added: log_handler_class and log_handler_params.  Default is using logging.FileHandler with None. \r\ne.g. 1\r\n`log_handler_class = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler`\r\n`log_handler_params = {\"maxBytes\":\"100000\"}`\r\ne.g. 2\r\n`log_handler_class = logging.handlers.TimedRotatingFileHandler`\r\n`log_handler_params = {\"backupCount\":7,\"interval\":1,\"when\":\"d\"}`\r\ndefault:\r\n`log_handler_class = logging.FileHandler`\r\n`log_handler_params = None`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] ./run_unit_tests.sh python2.7.x and python3.5.x \r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below fixing the issue outlined in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1413\r\n\r\nThe FTPSensor relies on an error message returned by the FTPHook. The expected message is \"Can't check for file existence\" and is used to check for errors in following way:\r\ntry:\r\n    hook.get_mod_time(self.path)\r\nexcept ftplib.error_perm as e:\r\n    error = str(e).split(None, 1)\r\n    if error[1] != \"Can't check for file existence\":\r\n        raise e\r\nHowever on my system (Linux/Antregos) this message text is different, leading to inevitable dag termination. Moreover the actual format of the exception on my system is different and the split returns '-' instead of the actual message.\r\n\r\nThis patch changes the operation to inspect error code rather than message text.\r\nIt also adds option to ignore certain classes of errors such as Host Unavailable that are recoverable, thus the performed action can and should be retried according to ftp spec. The default setting is to fail on all errors in order to preserve current behaviour.\r\n\r\nAdditional test cases added in

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\nThis makes an operator that allows simple Python code to execute simple virtualenvs. This is a WIP.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-XXX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThis change makes the create_evaluate_ops utility method make use of the\r\ndefault_args parameters of the DAG when possible. This simplifies the\r\nusage of the create_evaluate_ops method, and improves the usefulness of\r\na variety of default_args.\r\n\r\nTo further the usefulness of default_args for Cloud ML Operators, this\r\nchange also introduces version_name to the CloudMLVersionOperator,\r\nallowing model_name and version_name to be specified across an entire\r\npipeline.\r\n\r\nThis change also resolves a small TODO by making the\r\nDataFlowPythonOperator's `options` and `dataflow_default_options`\r\nvariables templatized.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

when using an ExternalTaskSensor sensor, to have a dag wait\r\nfor the completion of a task in another dag, there is no way, when\r\nclearing the task that is depended on, to also clear the ExternalTaskSensor\r\ntask (and its downstream/upstream tasks).\r\n\r\nHowever, that might be important when teams have separate responsibilities\r\nand create multi-staged data pipelines. Let's say there is a team responsible\r\nfor transforming logs to make them available in hadoop land. They maintain a\r\nhourly dag processing the raw logs. Other teams wait on the completion of\r\nthis dag using an ExternalTaskSensor. If the logging team realizes that\r\nsome logs where corrupted, not only do they have to rerun the task that\r\nprocessed these logs but also all the dags that use these logs to generate\r\nhigher level data.\r\n\r\nThis commit tries to solve this problem by introducing the notion of dag\r\ndescendants. The descendants of dag A are the dags that have an\r\nExternalTaskSensor pointing to a task of dag A.\r\nThen, when clearing a task in the view, an option is added to also clear\r\nthe tasks of the descendants (having the upstream, downstream, recursive,\r\nfuture and past flags act accordingly).\r\n\r\nDear Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR.

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1414] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1414\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\ntests.models:DagTest.test_descendants\r\ntests.models:DagTest.test_descendants_upstream\r\ntests.models:DagTest.test_descendants_downstream\r\ntests.models:DagTest.test_descendants_downstream_recursive\r\ntests.core.WebUiTests.test_dag_clear_view_with_descendants\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1411\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nSome TensorFlow libraries export models into versioned\r\nsubdirectories - some using incrementing versions, some using\r\nthe unix timestamp - making it difficult to create a version\r\nwhen the full deployment Uri must be known in advance.\r\n\r\nThis change makes it possible to specify the base path in which\r\nthe TensorFlow models are exported, and to create a CloudML\r\nversion using the exported model with the highest value (which\r\nshould be interpreted as the latest model export).\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1412\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nReasons for doing this:\r\n    1. webserver would hang if you try to view log that is too big\r\n    2. unlimited log size could be bad for disk space\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [X] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nI didn't see unit tests for logs in the code base\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [X] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1255\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [X] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe `SparkSubmitHook` implementation currently deadlocks if the Spark job logs \"too much\" output to stderr. This occurs because the current implementation tries to read from both stdout and stderr, but has been implemented incorrectly. Specifically the current implementation assumes it can read all of stdout in a blocking manner before looking at stderr. This fails if the job logs to stderr more than the kernel 'pipe buffer' limit (e.g. 64KB on modern Linux), causing the Spark job to be suspended as per Unix pipe semantics. At this point Airflow is waiting for EOF from Spark stdout and Spark is waiting on Airflow to drain the stderr pipe. That's a deadlock.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [X] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [ ] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1398) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1398] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1398\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nAdd ability for ExternalTaskSensor to wait on multiple runs of a task\r\n\r\nCurrently using the execution_date_fn parameter of the ExternalTaskSensor\r\nsensors only allows to wait for the completion of one given run of the\r\ntask the ExternalTaskSensor is sensing.\r\n\r\nHowever, this prevents users to have setups where dags don't have the same\r\nschedule frequency but still depend on one another. For example, let's say\r\nyou have a dag scheduled hourly that transforms log data and is owned by\r\nthe team in charge of logging.

In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [[AIRFLOW-1393] Enable Python3 tests on contrib Spark Submit Hook](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1393)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe unit tests in `tests/contrib/hooks/test_spark_submit_hook.py`\r\ncurrently skip if run in Python3 because some test cases  loop forever\r\ndue to a mismatch/misunderstanding about bytes vs string (i.e. the\r\nmocked data for `subprocess.Popen` doesn't behave the same as actually\r\nrunning Popen)\r\n\r\nThe fix is to use bytes and `six.ByteIO` so that the tests work on Py2\r\nand Py3. Alsowe had to patch `subprocess.Popen` in the right place so\r\nthe mocks are picked up.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- This PR removes the \"skip\" for Python3 for this test file.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-1387] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1387\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\nPython's format function has a feature of encoding the supplied\r\nvariable with the same encoding as a string where substitution will\r\ntake place. In case the string is not originally specified as unicode\r\ndefault encoding will be used. This will yield an error if\r\nsys.getdefaultencoding() is not 'utf-8' because it will try to encode\r\npreviously utf8 decoded string (with unicode chars) as non unicode.\r\nSolution based on SO 5082452.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\nDoes not add any unit tests as it affects function's side effects (not sure how to test it). I tested it on default vagrant ubuntu 16.04 machine using the task which was crashing before and it worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-08T00:28:11Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T18:43:33Z","closed_at":"2017-07-11T18:43:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"65dda1bbf4420a02aeaadfa929910a8b1efb2446","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2426/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2426/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2426/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/83ed0dd5d2063d1773f8d9ee3fe3ffb62ae238fb","head":{"label":"artiom33:logger_unicode_fix1","ref":"logger_unicode_fix1","sha":"83ed0dd5d2063d1773f8d9ee3fe3ffb62ae238fb","user":{"login":"artiom33","id":17766552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY2NTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17766552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33","html_url":"https://github.com/artiom33","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96581595,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjU4MTU5NQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"artiom33/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"artiom33","id":17766552,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3NzY2NTUy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17766552?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33","html_url":"https://github.com/artiom33","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/artiom33/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/artiom33/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nI realized that this might be a huge change, therefore instead of rushing into completing the code, I would like to open a  PR for discussion purposes.\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1386\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [ ] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nCurrently when the sensor is sleeping, the task process stays in RUNNING state and it still consumes resources such as memory (because the process does not terminate). This is waste of resource, especially when there are thousands of sensors sleeping and poking. Preferably when it sleeps, it would enter a SLEEP state and terminate, waiting for scheduler to reschedule it.\r\n\r\nWe encountered this issue when we were using S3KeySensors to sense some s3 paths that might not be present for days. (The exact time for them to be present could not be predicted because they were generated by external sources.) The running queue was quickly filled up with these S3KeySensors. Moreover, these sensors took a lot of memory even while they were sleeping.\r\n\r\nAlthough we might mimic the SLEEP state with UP_FOR_RETRY by using the following settings:\r\n```\r\ntimeout=0,\r\nretry_limit=99999999999999,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are still some cases that we would like to distinguish between SLEEP and UP_FOR_RETRY. For example, we may submit a certain command to a remote API service, and start polling for the running state of that command. Since the command might take long time to complete, we also want to leave RUNNING state so we could run other tasks on the local machine. However, when the remote API returns failure status, we would like to actually retry by submitting API request again.\r\n\r\nThere are some design choices that must be made:\r\n\r\n- Should sensors support both sleeping in RUNNING state and sleeping in SLEEP state? Or just drop the old behavior?\r\n- Should we reuse `poke_interval` for this purpose or create new parameters?\r\n- Should we implement it in `BaseOperator` so all tasks could sleep, or just `BaseSenorOperator`?\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [ ] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [ ] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue.

Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title.\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1383\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nThe CLI command `airflow clear` does not expose any way to set the `reset_dag_runs` parameter of the underlying `DAG.clear()` method.\r\n\r\nThis means that `airflow clear` will always cause affected DAG runs to be set to `state=RUNNING`, and immediately try and re-run the cleared tasks. In some circumstances it might not be desirable to immediately re-run everything.\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nA simple test for the CLI syntax is added to `tests/core.py`\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not

I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1382\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nDocker containers can have a default working directory set, done using docker run/create -w on the command line. This PR updates the DockerOperator to provide that option.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nParameter added into existing unit test.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-06T14:53:27Z","updated_at":"2017-07-11T18:57:37Z","closed_at":"2017-07-11T18:57:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d32d9d2a32b1d0c17d7e2bb0117e0776f8c17bd7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2419/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2419/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2419/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/eb158e121a7729894fc8823e50e3f413d91141b6","head":{"label":"benjaminsims:specify_working_directory","ref":"specify_working_directory","sha":"eb158e121a7729894fc8823e50e3f413d91141b6","user":{"login":"benjaminsims","id":793156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzE1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims","html_url":"https://github.com/benjaminsims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96311045,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjMxMTA0NQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"benjaminsims/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"benjaminsims","id":793156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzE1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims","html_url":"https://github.com/benjaminsims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/benjaminsims/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache

user to specify temporary directory to use on the host machine;\r\ndefault settings will cause an error on OS X due to the standard\r\ntemporary directory not being shared to Docker.\r\n\r\nDear Airflow maintainers,\r\n\r\nPlease accept this PR. I understand that it will not be reviewed until I have checked off all the steps below!\r\n\r\n\r\n### JIRA\r\n- [x] My PR addresses the following [Airflow JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW/) issues and references them in the PR title. For example, \"[AIRFLOW-XXX] My Airflow PR\"\r\n    - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AIRFLOW-1381\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n- [x] Here are some details about my PR, including screenshots of any UI changes:\r\n\r\nDockerOperator currently uses the standard TemporaryDirectory helper, which calls the standard libary. On OS X the default directory cannot be shared to Docker containers. This PR allows the host temporary directory to be specified by the user.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n- [x] My PR adds the following unit tests __OR__ does not need testing for this extremely good reason:\r\n\r\nAdded a test into docker_operator to ensure that mkdtemp is called correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Commits\r\n- [x] My commits all reference JIRA issues in their subject lines, and I have squashed multiple commits if they address the same issue. In addition, my commits follow the guidelines from \"[How to write a good git commit message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)\":\r\n    1. Subject is separated from body by a blank line\r\n    2. Subject is limited to 50 characters\r\n    3. Subject does not end with a period\r\n    4. Subject uses the imperative mood (\"add\", not \"adding\")\r\n    5. Body wraps at 72 characters\r\n    6. Body explains \"what\" and \"why\", not \"how\"\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-07-06T14:40:11Z","updated_at":"2019-06-05T12:08:03Z","closed_at":"2019-06-05T12:08:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"515776c8f023647a8ee6b8e26c1ef1f828dc2a0f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2418/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/2418/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/issues/2418/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/statuses/dd8c7224868e671e752b771a75abb585cf9b4cad","head":{"label":"benjaminsims:specify_host_dir","ref":"specify_host_dir","sha":"dd8c7224868e671e752b771a75abb585cf9b4cad","user":{"login":"benjaminsims","id":793156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzE1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims","html_url":"https://github.com/benjaminsims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":96311045,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NjMxMTA0NQ==","name":"incubator-airflow","full_name":"benjaminsims/incubator-airflow","private":false,"owner":{"login":"benjaminsims","id":793156,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5MzE1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/793156?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims","html_url":"https://github.com/benjaminsims","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/benjaminsims/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/benjaminsims/incubator-airflow","description":"Apache
