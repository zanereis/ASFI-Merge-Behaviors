Later patch releases are not compatible with Jepsen.\r\n\r\nThe Jepsen upgrade had an odd and undocumented behavioral change where DB#teardown is called at the start of the test, presumably to clean up stuff from previous runs. However, both our dbs and jepsen-zookeeper fail if the db hasn't been setup yet. To save time we just catch exceptions that occur during the teardown, log them, and continue as if nothing happened.\r\n\r\nI have run the tests locally to ensure they still pass.","created_at":"2021-12-06T13:50:11Z","updated_at":"2022-01-18T09:48:35Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T10:41:58Z","merged_at":"2021-12-08T10:41:58Z","merge_commit_sha":"d2da7b085ff0c4c16ef4188c30a9f68fdfeaad44","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278805855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODA1ODU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TestInfrastructure","name":"component=TestInfrastructure","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18028/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18028/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/18028/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/5c85fd211413aa0fad2b173f02d845dddb881394","head":{"label":"zentol:25180","ref":"25180","sha":"5c85fd211413aa0fad2b173f02d845dddb881394","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin

new File Source\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `RestoreMode` flag to be passed along with savepoint path. It determines the way a snapshot should be restored from. If a `CLAIM` mode is specified Flink will take ownership of the initial snapshot and will treat it as if it was created as a regular checkpoint and it might delete it at a certain point in time.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* Added tests for passing the flag in CLI\r\n* Added tests for passing the flag in REST API\r\n* Added tests in SavepointITCase for the `CLAIM` behaviour\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (**yes** / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

JUnit 5\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n `SourceReaderTestBase` uses JUnit 4 which will be deprecated. Migrating to use JUnit 5 API.\r\n\r\nThere are two derived tests classes, so changed their implementation to JUnit 5 as well.\r\n- KafkaSourceReaderTest\r\n- SourceReaderBaseTest\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- uses AssertThrows instead of JUnit 4 expectedException rule\r\n- Uses JUnit 5 api\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework (test change) without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? ( no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-06T05:03:33Z","updated_at":"2022-08-14T13:33:19Z","closed_at":"2022-01-03T12:08:36Z","merged_at":"2022-01-03T12:08:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b02f022cdcb4af449ed5dfe88acd3f9e4926dbe","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278805855,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODA1ODU1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TestInfrastructure","name":"component=TestInfrastructure","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18014/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18014/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/18014/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/3542eed0bfa4727c33c6b408118089f4966029c6","head":{"label":"streamnative:FLINK-24857","ref":"FLINK-24857","sha":"3542eed0bfa4727c33c6b408118089f4966029c6","user":{"login":"streamnative","id":44651383,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjUxMzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44651383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative","html_url":"https://github.com/streamnative","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321927437,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE5Mjc0Mzc=","name":"flink","full_name":"streamnative/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"streamnative","id":44651383,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ0NjUxMzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44651383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative","html_url":"https://github.com/streamnative","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/streamnative/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/streamnative/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\nUser stories:\r\n\r\nAs a Flink user, I’d like to use Kinesis Data Streams as sink for my data pipeline.\r\nContext:\r\n\r\nThe AsyncSinkWriter currently has a static batch size. We’d like to allow Sink users to specify what batch size they would like to use as they are in a better place to choose a batching logic/size for their needs. We’d like to also allow Sink developers to make use of the provided configuration mechanism for their Sink implementations.\r\n\r\n### Scope:\r\nImplement an asynchronous sink for Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) by inheriting the AsyncSinkBase class. The implementation can for now reside in its own module in flink-connectors. The module and package name can be anything reasonable e.g. flink-connector-aws-kinesis for the module name and org.apache.flink.connector.aws.kinesis for the package name. Side-note: There will be additional work later to move these implementations somewhere else (see theongoing discussion) (http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/flink-dev/202106.mbox/%3cCAGZNd0EbmGuD327_J4GvDyaOygaewXmjZ9KZN33Fv0v+J8gCcg@mail.gmail.com%3e).\r\nThe implementation must use the Kinesis Java Client (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/kinesis/AmazonKinesisClient.html).\r\nThe implementation must allow users to configure the Kinesis Client, with reasonable default settings.\r\nImplement an asynchornous sink writer for KDS by extending the AsyncSinkWriter. The implementation must deal with failed requests and retry them using the requeueFailedRequestEntry method. If possible, the implementation should batch multiple requests (PutRecordsRequestEntry objects) to KDS for increased throughput. The implemented Sink Writer will be used by the Sink class that will be created as part of this story.\r\nUnit/Integration testing. Use Kinesalite (in-memory Kinesis simulation). We already use this in KinesisTableApiITCase.\r\nJava / code-level docs.\r\n### Brief change log\r\nAdded Kinesis Data Streams Sink into a new module flink-connectors/flink-connector-kinesis-async\r\nEdit: flink-connectors/flink-connector-kinesis-async is now flink-connectors/flink-connector-aws (as of 2021-10-01)\r\nVerifying this change\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\nAdded integration tests set up with Kinesalite\r\nDoes this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\nDependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\nThe public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with @Public(Evolving): no\r\nThe serializers: no\r\nThe runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\nAnything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\nThe S3 file system connector: no\r\nDocumentation\r\nDoes this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\nIf yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n- If a package depended on both `flink-connector-aws-base` and `flink-connector-kinesis`, there would be a duplication of the classes from the first from the shaded JAR of the second\r\n- This change relocates classes from `flink-connector-aws-base` in the shaded JAR of `flink-connector-kinesis`\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- The `pom.xml` of `flink-connector-kinesis` has been updated to relocate used classes from `flink-connector-aws-base`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? not applicable\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-03T15:43:49Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T14:52:19Z","closed_at":"2021-12-05T09:56:42Z","merged_at":"2021-12-05T09:56:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"ca4fbd10a1e8919c48e602640bc3238648cc48bb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dannycranmer","id":4950503,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ5NTA1MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4950503?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer","html_url":"https://github.com/dannycranmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannycranmer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273338726,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzM4NzI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kinesis","name":"component=Connectors/Kinesis","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18010/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18010/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/18010/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/2e1eb05a198c9401670ac1aff5e47d76a0e1c4a0","head":{"label":"CrynetLogistics:flip-171-177-T2-5-shading-fix","ref":"flip-171-177-T2-5-shading-fix","sha":"2e1eb05a198c9401670ac1aff5e47d76a0e1c4a0","user":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":398223482,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTgyMjM0ODI=","name":"flink","full_name":"CrynetLogistics/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the KafkaCommitter we retry transactions if they failed during\r\ncommitting. Since we reuse the KafkaProducers we update the used\r\ntransactionalId to continue committing other transactions. To prevent\r\naccidental overwrites we track the transaction state inside the\r\nFlinkKafkaInternalProducer.\r\nBefore this change, the state was not reset on a failures during the\r\ntransaction finalization, and setting a new transactionalId failed.\r\nThe state is now always reset nevertheless whether finalizing the\r\ntransaction fails (commit, abort).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Reset internal state of FlinkKafkaInternalProducer if transaction finalization fails\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added a test to verify that transaction finalization resets the internal state\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-03T14:17:11Z","updated_at":"2021-12-10T15:04:24Z","closed_at":"2021-12-10T15:04:24Z","merged_at":"2021-12-10T15:04:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"577648379c2abb429259ac1a46ca6a04550f3dbd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18009/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18009/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/18009/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8f5d00d3614e2f561a668b022166b12b40242f59","head":{"label":"fapaul:FLINK-25126","ref":"FLINK-25126","sha":"8f5d00d3614e2f561a668b022166b12b40242f59","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul/flink","description":"Apache

of #17179 to rebase, address feedback and merge.\r\n\r\nFrom FLINK-22483, the CompletedCheckpointStore will not change during task failover, so we only need to rebuild the SharedStateRegistry once, which can reduce the recovery time during failover.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMove `SharedStateRigistry` to `CompleteCheckpointStore` to make the life cycle of them consistent, so that we only need to re-register the shared state once when the `CompleteCheckpointStore` is restored, which can reduce the time of task failover.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n1. Add `SharedStateRegistry` to the `createRecoveredCompletedCheckpointStore` method of `CheckpointRecoveryFactory`, and let `CompletedCheckpointStore` manage `SharedStateRegistry` by itself. `CheckpointCoordinator` no longer manages `SharedStateRegistry`.\r\n2. When the `CompletedCheckpointStore` is recovering, it will also register the shared state of the recovered `CompletedCheckpoint`.\r\n3. `CompletedCheckpointStore` adds the `registerSharedState` method, which is used to provide an interface for the `CheckpointCoordinator` to register the shared state.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n  - *Added a test to verify that the shared state reference is correct and can be deleted correctly when the SharedStateRegistry is not rebuilt during failover.*\r\n>  org.apache.flink.runtime.checkpoint.CheckpointCoordinatorTest#testSharedStateRegistrationWithoutRebuildSharedStateRegistry\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

documented)","created_at":"2021-12-02T22:21:07Z","updated_at":"2021-12-09T16:00:34Z","closed_at":"2021-12-09T16:00:31Z","merged_at":"2021-12-09T16:00:31Z","merge_commit_sha":"718609d1d0349ab544f09012894d68fa10d10b1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18001/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18001/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/18001/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ec6430569e4fbc9e6b8430809cfd1bdcd93265eb","head":{"label":"rkhachatryan:f24086","ref":"f24086","sha":"ec6430569e4fbc9e6b8430809cfd1bdcd93265eb","user":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":222429887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjI0Mjk4ODc=","name":"flink","full_name":"rkhachatryan/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rkhachatryan","id":3939322,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5MzkzMjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3939322?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan","html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rkhachatryan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rkhachatryan/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-02T19:00:13Z","updated_at":"2021-12-17T13:06:36Z","closed_at":"2021-12-17T13:06:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a3adeacc0b2c6ca8ba0756fdaea1883c5f6d01e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18000/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/18000/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/18000/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/4d99a00cc72ca26011315e16182f737434d749b4","head":{"label":"CrynetLogistics:flip-171-177-T2-5-a","ref":"flip-171-177-T2-5-a","sha":"4d99a00cc72ca26011315e16182f737434d749b4","user":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":398223482,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTgyMjM0ODI=","name":"flink","full_name":"CrynetLogistics/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-02T18:59:26Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:42:47Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17999/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17999/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17999/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/c3c9dd044f35d1ff4c981493c2386713c9a73748","head":{"label":"CrynetLogistics:flip-171-177-T2-5-d","ref":"flip-171-177-T2-5-d","sha":"c3c9dd044f35d1ff4c981493c2386713c9a73748","user":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":398223482,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTgyMjM0ODI=","name":"flink","full_name":"CrynetLogistics/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-02T18:58:36Z","updated_at":"2021-12-17T13:06:30Z","closed_at":"2021-12-17T13:06:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ecb9dc2e3f0c71d2c11d6ac388396e5585e745e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17998/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17998/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17998/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/50abe65ff11ded2774989780ba5acd60f955bb7d","head":{"label":"CrynetLogistics:flip-171-177-T2-5-c","ref":"flip-171-177-T2-5-c","sha":"50abe65ff11ded2774989780ba5acd60f955bb7d","user":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":398223482,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTgyMjM0ODI=","name":"flink","full_name":"CrynetLogistics/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-02T18:57:28Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:42:47Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17997/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17997/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17997/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/32b85aa9712b9ddce73a08f31f3d9e0ff7e97b90","head":{"label":"CrynetLogistics:flip-171-177-T2-5-b","ref":"flip-171-177-T2-5-b","sha":"32b85aa9712b9ddce73a08f31f3d9e0ff7e97b90","user":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":398223482,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTgyMjM0ODI=","name":"flink","full_name":"CrynetLogistics/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CrynetLogistics","id":9928830,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk5Mjg4MzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9928830?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics","html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CrynetLogistics/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CrynetLogistics/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17946\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/17946\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis is a part of FLIP-189 which improves completion of Flink SQL CLI command completion.\r\n\r\nFrom user's side it looks like that \r\nhttps://asciinema.org/a/453046?speed=2.0\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIt introduces `CliCommandAggregateCompleter` which could build completion for each command.\r\nAlso there has been introduced a `FlinkCliCandidate` which could show/hide completion description depending on a corresponding property value.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that is done here: introduction of `MockLineReaderImpl` in tests to allow tests of several words completion.\r\n\r\nit includes update of jline as it is required for completion candidate description\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThere are tests in `CliClientTest#testSqlCompletion`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes)   update of jline to 3.21.0\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd a new config option: `table.exec.sink.legacy-cast-behaviour`, so that users can\r\nchoose between the legacy behaviour of CAST or the new one, including improvements and fixes.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Introduce a new config option\r\n  - Add a new method to the CastRule contexts, so retrieve the value of this config option\r\n  - Change Row->String rule to be able to use the `,` delimiter for legacy behaviour vs `, ` for the new one.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded possibility to `CastTestRules` so that tests can run with legacy behaviour enabled & disabled.\r\nAdded tests for casting ROW -> STRING, to verify the legacy vs the new behaviour\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nUsing backticks for Chinese makes the document unsightly, as you can see in https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/zh/docs/dev/datastream/execution_mode/ and I don't know if I need to create a jira issue to associate this pr, cause I think this is a very trivial fix.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency):  no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?  no\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-01T13:23:07Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:42:46Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17983/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17983/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17983/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/ed890d37e6fb351e894588616cd6f7fc0997a636","head":{"label":"Mulavar:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"ed890d37e6fb351e894588616cd6f7fc0997a636","user":{"login":"Mulavar","id":23017406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDE3NDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23017406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar","html_url":"https://github.com/Mulavar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":387403393,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODc0MDMzOTM=","name":"flink","full_name":"Mulavar/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Mulavar","id":23017406,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDE3NDA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23017406?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar","html_url":"https://github.com/Mulavar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Mulavar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Mulavar/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nBefore this commit the RetryRule actually prevented retries of tests\r\ninheriting from KafkaConsumerTestBase. Now, the retries are handled by\r\nKafkaTestBase and all subclasses have the same retry behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove unused retry rule from KafkaConsumerTestBase\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI manually invoked an exception and hit the timeout of a test in KafkaITCase to verify the test is retried.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-01T13:16:56Z","updated_at":"2021-12-01T16:47:48Z","closed_at":"2021-12-01T16:47:48Z","merged_at":"2021-12-01T16:47:48Z","merge_commit_sha":"e4c7d7863962b32b1ea1f799278289e0fe07bf70","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17981/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17981/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17981/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/931c05851e323243f2521862e60532b603fa964b","head":{"label":"fapaul:FLINK-25134","ref":"FLINK-25134","sha":"931c05851e323243f2521862e60532b603fa964b","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd variable expansion for FLINK_ENV_JAVA_OPTS, and introduce variable FLINK_LOG_PREFIX in flink to make env.java.opts in the documentation like \"-Xlog:gc*:file=${FLINK_LOG_PREFIX}.gc.log\" work.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add FLINK_ENV_JAVA_OPTS=$(eval echo ${FLINK_ENV_JAVA_OPTS}) before starting the JVM.*\r\n  - *Introduce variable FLINK_LOG_PREFIX, so that env.java.opts value containing this variable can get eval correctly.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

kafka markdown error\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-01T06:28:41Z","updated_at":"2022-11-08T15:07:20Z","closed_at":"2022-01-14T09:10:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1e3d9251c1378e7d287083d91e8da609f8a6dcf3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17971/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17971/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17971/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/8ae9baf7cb758e0df2e70d399acc08a13a651aea","head":{"label":"mingwayXue:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"8ae9baf7cb758e0df2e70d399acc08a13a651aea","user":{"login":"mingwayXue","id":23020209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDIwMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23020209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue","html_url":"https://github.com/mingwayXue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":284165740,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODQxNjU3NDA=","name":"flink","full_name":"mingwayXue/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"mingwayXue","id":23020209,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDIwMjA5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23020209?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue","html_url":"https://github.com/mingwayXue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mingwayXue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/mingwayXue/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd variable expansion for FLINK_ENV_JAVA_OPTS, and introduce variable FLINK_LOG_PREFIX in flink to make env.java.opts in the documentation like \"-Xlog:gc*:file=${FLINK_LOG_PREFIX}.gc.log\" work.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add FLINK_ENV_JAVA_OPTS=$(eval echo ${FLINK_ENV_JAVA_OPTS}) before starting the JVM.*\r\n  - *Introduce variable FLINK_LOG_PREFIX, so that env.java.opts value containing this variable can get eval correctly.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2021-12-01T05:45:08Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:42:44Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"350352b182e028d63461c856718a3f5e03e66da7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273239272,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMjM5Mjcy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=CommandLineClient","name":"component=CommandLineClient","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17970/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17970/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17970/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e8824fe7506c49979f6f151e8daf2eeb13f51c9c","head":{"label":"CodeFerriCode:release-1.12","ref":"release-1.12","sha":"e8824fe7506c49979f6f151e8daf2eeb13f51c9c","user":{"login":"CodeFerriCode","id":8397282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTcyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8397282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode","html_url":"https://github.com/CodeFerriCode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":433693999,"node_id":"R_kgDOGdmlLw","name":"flink","full_name":"CodeFerriCode/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"CodeFerriCode","id":8397282,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzOTcyODI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8397282?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode","html_url":"https://github.com/CodeFerriCode","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/CodeFerriCode/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/CodeFerriCode/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR unifies the code paths for stop-with-savepoint both with and without drain.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - EndOfData emitted both in case of stop-with-savepoint --drain and --no-drain\r\n  - Stopping the source both with & without drain. We do not process data after stop-with-savepoint\r\n  - Removed the synchronous loop. We always wait in the `afterInvoke` method.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n* All existing tests passed. \r\n* Removed a couple of tests which do no longer hold. They were testing for corner case behaviours of stop-with-savepoint --no-drain which do no longer hold.\r\n* Modified `testTriggerStopWithSavepointNoDrainWhenWaitingForFinalCheckpointOnSourceTask`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / **JavaDocs** / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-30T16:01:07Z","updated_at":"2021-12-08T07:17:04Z","closed_at":"2021-12-08T07:17:04Z","merged_at":"2021-12-08T07:17:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"2b167ae9764c02d4c77a41f2afd056ed8fd5f04f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1401080710,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDAxMDgwNzEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Task","name":"component=Runtime/Task","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17968/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17968/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17968/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f6b4bbefc02b81397c7a9147a329bf490826058c","head":{"label":"dawidwys:flink-23532","ref":"flink-23532","sha":"f6b4bbefc02b81397c7a9147a329bf490826058c","user":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43764900,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mzc2NDkwMA==","name":"flink","full_name":"dawidwys/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys/flink","description":"Mirror

`RootExceptionHistoryEntry` is added if the passed `ExecutionGraph` contains a failure.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI extended the `DefaultJobMasterServiceProcessTest` to cover the

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR fixes the exception in afterInvoke when async operator adds recursive mail to mailbox.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Ignoring RejectedExecutionException in async operator*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added new test to AsyncWaitOperatorTest*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces codepath where a ConfigOption is used as a key lookup in a Map of Strings with the correct lookup using the Configuration object built from the Map.

the first case and only booking_channel_key from left table in the second case. The result is one has uniqueKey and the other doesn't.\r\nt.booking_channel_key, t.passenger_key is the unique key of the first join output, but previously this info was lost.\r\n\r\n## Brief change

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFor a given HDFS operation (e.g. delete file), it's very helpful to track which upper level job issues it. The upper level callers may be specific Oozie tasks, MR jobs, and hive queries. One scenario is that the namenode (NN) is abused/spammed, the operator may want to know immediately which MR job should be blamed so that she can kill it. To this end, the caller context contains at least the application-dependent \"tracking id\".\r\n\r\nThe above is the main effect of the Caller Context. HDFS Client set Caller Context, then name node get it in audit log to do some work.\r\n\r\nNow FLink need to have the Caller Context to meet the HDFS Job Audit requirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-30T09:42:40Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T12:05:31Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1278672464,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4NjcyNDY0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=FileSystems","name":"component=FileSystems","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/f8d57f6a82a33d4b6dd0949321c9d49b19969cab","head":{"label":"liufangqi:master","ref":"master","sha":"f8d57f6a82a33d4b6dd0949321c9d49b19969cab","user":{"login":"liufangqi","id":34703664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzAzNjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34703664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi","html_url":"https://github.com/liufangqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":433280328,"node_id":"R_kgDOGdNVSA","name":"flink","full_name":"liufangqi/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liufangqi","id":34703664,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzAzNjY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34703664?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi","html_url":"https://github.com/liufangqi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liufangqi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liufangqi/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAll tests based on our legacy Kafka infrastructure fail quite frequently due to various connectivity issues when communicating with the brokers. All our future tests for the unified sources and sinks are based on dockerized tests where we do not see any of the issues. So to ease the maintenance/deprecation of the old tests we add a retry rule for all tests based on the KafkaTestBase class.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add retry rule to `KafkaTestBase`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Tests still pass\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-30T09:30:14Z","updated_at":"2021-12-01T08:30:20Z","closed_at":"2021-12-01T08:30:20Z","merged_at":"2021-12-01T08:30:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"2e018d0bc04935e50f0f602405c2f610af744e1f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273164140,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTY0MTQw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Tests","name":"component=Tests","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/60959c234672a067f5b0778da832df6eeb56b241","head":{"label":"fapaul:FLINK-15493","ref":"FLINK-15493","sha":"60959c234672a067f5b0778da832df6eeb56b241","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n\r\n-- Duplicate test branch\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nPlease make sure both new and modified tests in this PR follows the conventions defined in our code quality guide: https://flink.apache.org/contributing/code-style-and-quality-common.html#testing\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*This PR fixes the problem with reporting stats*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Added synchronization for reading vertex in CheckpointCoordinator*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nNo new tests for this case\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-29T12:26:47Z","updated_at":"2021-12-02T08:33:20Z","closed_at":"2021-12-02T08:33:19Z","merged_at":"2021-12-02T08:33:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"b1c85d2fb158988c77f2e478e9697cebec9a4395","assignee":{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dawidwys","id":6242259,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyNDIyNTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6242259?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys","html_url":"https://github.com/dawidwys","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dawidwys/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17946/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17946/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17946/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/38f782490139f62b4f5d9fd1b48283d7663e1765","head":{"label":"akalash:flink-24919-2","ref":"flink-24919-2","sha":"38f782490139f62b4f5d9fd1b48283d7663e1765","user":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":344520862,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDQ1MjA4NjI=","name":"flink","full_name":"akalash/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"akalash","id":3996532,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY1MzI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996532?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash","html_url":"https://github.com/akalash","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/akalash/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.c

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the Kafka version bump did not fully resolve the flakiness of the FlinkKafkaProducerITCase so we apply the fix of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-21214 to retry the failed cases because we highly suspect the non-dockerized test setup.\r\n\r\nOnce we have fully removed the FlinkKafkaProducer and all APIs are migrated to the KafkaSink we can also remove the test old test infrastructure.\r\n\r\nWe do not see any of the failures with regard to the dockerized test environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add two retries on failure for all tests in FlinkKafkaProducerITCase\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nChange only affects test code.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-29T12:04:59Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T16:36:43Z","closed_at":"2021-11-29T16:36:43Z","merged_at":"2021-11-29T16:36:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"faaa7c85d302bbdb448d28a9e6fdfe59d58ecc33","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17944/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17944/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17944/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/380bb967fcfec7fc4bcf5319ca3e3b98df61c536","head":{"label":"fapaul:FLINK-15493","ref":"FLINK-15493","sha":"380bb967fcfec7fc4bcf5319ca3e3b98df61c536","user":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":246338488,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDYzMzg0ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"fapaul/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fapaul","id":7405553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc0MDU1NTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7405553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul","html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fapaul/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fapaul/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPage content.zh/docs/ops/state/checkpoints.md and content.zh/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/checkpointing.md are very much out of date and out of sync of theirs english counterparts.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nTranslate \"checkpoints\" and \"checkpointing\" page to Chinese\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-29T10:43:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:42:41Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"curcur","id":11065508,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMDY1NTA4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11065508?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur","html_url":"https://github.com/curcur","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/curcur/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278841078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODQxMDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=chinese-translation","name":"component=chinese-translation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17943/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17943/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17943/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fb087fc620cd1c381dc915ff9de04e109979b49b","head":{"label":"wulei0302:zh-translate-checkpoint","ref":"zh-translate-checkpoint","sha":"fb087fc620cd1c381dc915ff9de04e109979b49b","user":{"login":"wulei0302","id":52473940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDczOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52473940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302","html_url":"https://github.com/wulei0302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286606384,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY2MDYzODQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"wulei0302/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wulei0302","id":52473940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDczOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52473940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302","html_url":"https://github.com/wulei0302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wulei0302/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n* The Docker test git clones the Flink Docker repo. To harden the test, we should retry if git clone fails, as we have seen with other tests. With #17881 a retry function was introduced. This PR refactors the Docker test to use this retry function. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Refactored Docker Bash e2e test to use retry function\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n##

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nPage content.zh/docs/ops/state/checkpoints.md and content.zh/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/checkpointing.md are very much out of date and out of sync of theirs english counterparts.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nTranslate \"checkpoints\" and \"checkpointing\" page to Chinese\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2021-11-29T09:41:34Z","updated_at":"2021-11-29T10:47:02Z","closed_at":"2021-11-29T09:42:20Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"881fc87e46b62dd39df03e71f620ba6223f11102","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278841078,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4ODQxMDc4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=chinese-translation","name":"component=chinese-translation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17940/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/17940/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/17940/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/fa609842fd99935c88734500bde9e0f24be68406","head":{"label":"wulei0302:translate-zh-checkpoint","ref":"translate-zh-checkpoint","sha":"fa609842fd99935c88734500bde9e0f24be68406","user":{"login":"wulei0302","id":52473940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDczOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52473940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302","html_url":"https://github.com/wulei0302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":286606384,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyODY2MDYzODQ=","name":"flink","full_name":"wulei0302/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wulei0302","id":52473940,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDczOTQw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52473940?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302","html_url":"https://github.com/wulei0302","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wulei0302/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wulei0302/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nEnhance the pulsar source unit test for the following classes\r\n- PulsarSourceReader\r\n- PulsarPartitionSplitReader\r\n- PulsarSourceEnumerator\r\n- PulsarSourceBuilder\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nOne bug fix with this test enhancement:\r\n1. [BUG FIX] Fix overflow when stopCursor is latest and use exclusive start cursor .\r\n2. Added tests for Ordered and Unordered version of PulsarSourceReader and PulsarPartitionSplitReader\r\n3. Improved tests for PulsarSourceEnumerator and PulsarSourceBuilder\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nLocal Test failed due to a test failure not related to this change, see if that can pass in the CI.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, the read buffer request timeout implementation of sort-shuffle is a little aggressive. As reported in the mailing list: https://lists.apache.org/thread/bd3s5bqfg9oxlb1g1gg3pxs3577lhf88. The `TimeoutException` may be triggered if there is data skew and the downstream task is slow. Actually, we can further improve this case by reseting the request timeout on buffer recycling. \r\n\r\nWhen at least one buffer is recycled, we know that the downstream is in a normal state, so the buffer request timeout should be reset to avoid throwing a timeout exception.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Reset the request buffer timeout if at least one buffer is recycled*\r\n  - *Fix spelling error in method name `SortMergeResultPartitionReadScheduler#createSubpartitionReader`*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added test that validates that the buffer request timeout when there was no recycled buffer*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that the buffer request timeout would be increased when at least one buffer is recycled, and the request will not be timeout*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe tests `testRowNamed` and `testDeepToString` are flaky due to the non-deterministic order of HashMap. In this PR the order is fixed with the use of LinkedHashMap.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n - Used `LinkedHashMap` instead of `HashMap` in Class `Row`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n  - `testRowNamed` \r\n  - `testDeepToString`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: don't know\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): don't know\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components),

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, JDBC connector assumes columns names respect Java identifier naming restrictions, but databases that support JDBC may have different naming restrictions. For example, MySQL allows dots and colons in column names. In that case, JDBC connector would have trouble parsing the named parameters in SQL.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem by adding enclosing parentheses to the named parameters.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Add  enclosing parentheses to the named parameters\r\n  - Escape reserved characters like ':'\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUpdate existing tests to cover some corner cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no \r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no \r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no \r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdded some basic utilities for testing table apis, like:\r\n\r\n* `assertThat(DataType)`\r\n* `assertThat(LogicalType)`\r\n* `assertThat(RowData)`\r\n\r\nAlso add `FlinkAssertions` in `flink-test-utils-junit` to add some assertions and utilities to use together with assertj. Also deprecate the old matchers for hamcrest.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Add `TableAssertions` to encapsulate all the assertion constructors for our custom assertions\r\n* Add `FlinkAssertions`\r\n* Refactored some tests from junit assertions and hamcrest to assertj\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors `PlannerExpressionParser` to be loaded through the `Factory` SPI infrastructure. It also renames `PlannerExpressionParser` to `ExpressionParser`, as the original name is misleading (is it a parser or a planner?!) and it's implicit the fact that the implementation is planner provided, given it lives in the `org.apache.flink.table.delegation` package.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Renamed `PlannerExpressionParser` to `ExpressionParser`\r\n* Added a new `ExpressionParserFactory` to load the `ExpressionParser` and added the `DefaultExpressionParserFactory`\r\n* Removed `org.apache.flink.table.expressions.ExpressionParser` as it doesn't provide any particular value \r\n* Removed `WindowCreationValidationTest` which haven't much sense now. Previously, they were testing the reflection failure with the nice exception, but now we use the `FactoryUtil` methods which are already well tested\r\n\r\nNote that the git changelog confuses the `PlannerExpressionParser` renaming with the removal of `org.apache.flink.table.expressions.ExpressionParser`.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request
