of SSLEngine with NIO has proven to be less robust than using\r\n\"old-io\" SSLSockets.  This PR reintroduces SSLSockets into cluster\r\ncommunications and removes the use of \"new IO\" SSLEngine as an option.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the org.apache.geode.internal.tcp package is left\r\nintact.  None of the old code including Connection.runOioReader() has\r\nbeen brought back.  Code differences between use of NIO and OIO are\r\nminimal and are mostly at the socket-read/socket-write level.  The\r\nMsgReader class is modified to handle buffer manipulation that was in\r\nthe previous \"old IO\" implementation but was delegated to the \"filter\"\r\nimplementation prior to this PR.\r\n\r\nPerformance testing has shown that serialization and transmission of\r\nmessages works best with \"direct\" memory buffers while the reading of\r\nmessages with SSL functions best with \"heap\" memory buffers.\r\nDirectChannel and DirectReplyProcessor reflect the choice of \"direct\"\r\nmemory buffers for writing while ClusterConnection's inputBuffer reflects\r\nthe choice of \"heap\" memory buffers for reading.\r\n\r\nThe cluster communications class has been renamed to ClusterConnection\r\nbecause I'm very tired of the client/server Connection class having the\r\nsame name.  Every time I try to open the class with IntelliJ it\r\nrecommends the client/server class as the first option.

PR completes the work started in GEODE-8240, and continued in GEODE-8330.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of this PR is renaming:\r\n\r\n`Version` -> `KnownVersion`\r\n`VersionOrdinal` -> `Version`\r\n\r\nAfter this change, the versioning hierarchy will be:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"477\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4002/87099515-e1100980-c1fe-11ea-8767-dc07fb677745.png\">\r\n\r\nIn the first try at a PR, Git didn't notice that these two important source files _moved_. Instead they showed up as delete+create.\r\n\r\nFor this PR I'm starting with explicit `git mv` and then IntelliJ refactoring to rename the class inside the moved file, for each of the two source files. I'm putting each of those two `git mv` into a separate commit. After that I'm doing all the tidying up of related names (methods, fields, parameters, variables) and the minor substantive changes needed for upgrade tests that are looking for renamed classes/methods via reflection.\r\n \r\nI intend to **not squash** when I merge this PR. Instead I'll edit the history so there are two commits: one with the `git mv Version.java KnownVersion.java` and a second one with any other `git mv`s and other changes.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n`git mv`s:\r\n- [x] `Version.java` -> `KnownVersion.java`\r\n- [x] `VersionOrdinal.java` -> `Version.java`\r\n- [x] `VersionJUnitTest.java` -> `KnownVersionJUnitTest.java`\r\n\r\n`Versioning`\r\n- [x] `getVersionOrdinal()` -> `getVersion()`\r\n\r\n`KnownVersion`\r\n- [x] `getKnownVersion(final short ordinal, final KnownVersion returnWhenUnknown)` -> `getKnownVersionOrDefault(final short ordinal, final KnownVersion defaultKnownVersion)`\r\n\r\n`MemberIdentifier`\r\n- [x] `getVersionOrdinalObject()` -> `getVersion()`\r\n- [x] `setVersionObjectForTest()` -> `setVersionForTest()`\r\n\r\n`MemberData`\r\n- [x] `getVersionOrdinalObject()` -> `getVersion()`\r\n\r\n`VersionManager`\r\n- [x] `findVersionClass()` add a third class search option for `KnownVersion`\r\n\r\n`LuceneSearchWithRollingUpgradeTestBase`\r\n- [x]  in `assertVersion()` add third method search option for `\"getVersion\"` method\r\n\r\nScour Javadoc for \"VersionOrdinal\" and friends and make sure they are up to date and use `{@link xx}` and `{@code xx}` where needed\r\n- [x] `Versioning`\r\n- [x] `KnownVersion`\r\n- [x] `Version`\r\n- [x] `AbstractVersion`\r\n- [x]  `UnknownVersion`\r\n- [x] `VersioningJUnitTest`\r\n- [x] `KnownVersionJUnitTest`\r\n\r\n## Dev Testing\r\nrun `RollingUpgradeDUnitTest`, `LuceneSearchWithRollingUpgradeTest`s\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

we have one redundant copy of the data, and since we modify the data using a function, I think we may have a data corruption issue with non-idempotent operations. What can happen is that an operation like APPEND can:\r\n0) executor called on non-primary redis server,\r\n1) modify the primary (by sending a function exec to it),\r\n2) modify the secondary (by sending a geode delta to it),\r\n3) the primary server fails now (before the function executing on it completes),\r\n4) the non-primary redis server sees the function fail and that it is marked as HA so it retries it. This time it sends it the secondary, which is the new primary, but the operation was actually done on the secondary so this retry will end up doing the operation twice.\r\n\r\nThis may be okay for certain ops (like SADD) that are idempotent (but even they could cause extra key events in the future), but for ops like APPEND we end up appending twice.\r\n\r\nThis will only happen when a server executing a function dies and our function service retries the function on another server because it is marked HA. The easy way to fix this is to change our function to not be HA. This is just a single one line change.\r\nNote that our clients can already see exceptions/errors if the server they are connected to dies. When that happens the operation they requested may have happened, and if they have multiple geode redis servers running it may have been stored and still in memory. So clients will need some logic to decide if they should redo such an operation or not (because it is already done).\r\n\r\nNote: By making the function non-HA, it should just give the client another case in which they need to handle a server crash. It can now be for servers they were not connected to but that were involved in performing the operation they requested.\r\n","created_at":"2020-07-07T21:26:42Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T22:31:17Z","closed_at":"2020-07-10T22:31:17Z","merged_at":"2020-07-10T22:31:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"25bb3b53fdb31a28bde5376bb105ee0ed2414c9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"dschneider-pivotal","id":11197400,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMTk3NDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11197400?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal","html_url":"https://github.com/dschneider-pivotal","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dschneider-pivotal/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2044162300,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDQ0MTYyMzAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/geode/labels/redis","name":"redis","color":"e6363b","default":false,"description":"Issues

hangs with concurrent publishers and subscribers on multiple\r\nservers.

Added DUnit test to\r\nrecreate failure.\r\nTo preserve the order of incoming commands, even when some of them are running asynchronously in background threads, a command queue now exists. When an async commands comes in (currently only PUBLISH is async) then it goes in the queue and is started. Any other commands that come in while it is in progress are added to the a queue. Once the async command completes it also drains the command queue down to the next async command it finds in it.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Murtuza Boxwala

is a follow-on PR to the versioning repair done in GEODE-8240. During the work for that ticket we saw lots of little things that needed cleaning up, but we didn't want to do them in that other PR because we had a couple releases waiting for that work. Also we didn't want to increase the complexity of the back-porting work.\r\n\r\nThis PR centers on improvements to the `Versioning` factory https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5344/files#diff-98ef6d6138fd23032a433b5e4d592beeR29\r\n\r\nThat factory provides two methods:\r\n\r\n* `static VersionOrdinal getVersionOrdinal(final short ordinal)`\r\n* `static Version getKnownVersion(final VersionOrdinal anyVersion, Version returnWhenUnknown)`\r\n\r\nThe first is used to find the known or unknown version for a `short` version ordinal value recovered via deserialization. It's returned as a `VersionOrdinal` (unknown version reference) because in general we don't know if the `short` will designate a known version (`Version`). The second method is a safe downcast for the result from the first method. If `anyVersion` refers to a known version then it is simply downcast and returned, otherwise `returnWhenUnknown` is returned.\r\n\r\nPackage protection on `UnknownVersion` keeps construction inside the package and the only place we construct those is in the factory (`Versioning`). As was the case before this PR, instances of known versions (`Version`) are constructable only inside `Version.java`.\r\n\r\n## Review Needed\r\n\r\nThis PR eliminates throwing of `UnsupportedSerializationVersionException` by versioning code. After this PR, the only place that exception is thrown is in `TcpServer`.\r\n\r\nBecause that exception is no longer thrown, these locales required nontrivial refactoring that would benefit from review:\r\n\r\n* `ClientRegistrationMetadata.getAndValidateClientVersion()` https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5344/files#diff-a9fb60b1fcc060dc57ed2bb00f3a604fR117\r\n* `ServerSideHandshakeFactory.readClientVersion()` https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5344/files#diff-561a1b83fe67d82f661fc2f0d84a80d6R70\r\n* `TcpClient.requestToServer()` https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5344/files#diff-614b2350ec08835b7b2179bdef94ff35R153\r\n* `TcpServer.processOneConnect()` https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5344/files#diff-094a0faa5954f653b2b3b51d50469854R429\r\n\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\n- [x] got rid of confusing and wrong inheritance relationship between `VersionOrdinalImpl` and `Version`: now `Version` (i.e. known version) and `UnknownVersion` both extend `AbstractVersion` which implements `VersionOrdinal`—improved naming of this hierarchy will come, probably in a follow-on PR since it would touch lots of files\r\n- [x] fleshed-out `Versioning` factory\r\n  - [x] added `Version getKnownVersion(final VersionOrdinal anyVersion, Version returnWhenUnknown)` method that simply downcasts `anyVersion` if it can\r\n  - [x] now there is exactly _one way_ to construct a version (`VersionOrdinal`) from a `short`, and there is exactly _one way_ to get a known version (`Version`) from a `VersionOrdinal`\r\n- [x] version acquisition no longer throws exceptions ever\r\n- [x] eliminated `InternalDistributedMember.getVersionObject()` in favor of `Versioning.getKnownVersion(Versioning.getVersionOrdinal(ver), Version.CURRENT)`: the latter makes it clear to maintainers that `Version.CURRENT` will be used as a stand-in for unknown versions\r\n- [x] moved I/O logic to a separate class, `VersioningIO`\r\n- [x] eliminated tons of redundant and unused methods in `Version`\r\n\r\nType hierarchy is now:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"518\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4002/86401697-89522b00-bc5f-11ea-84b5-b84ec3748f27.png\">\r\n\r\nNames in bold aren't as clear as we'd like so they'll change eventually, in a follow-on PR:\r\n\r\n`Version` will become `KnownVersion`\r\n`VersionOrdinal` will become `Version` yay\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically `develop`)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a

bfe1ca113124ea958dc02dd9be90cdb0aabe5c4d`\r\n\r\nIn resolving conflicts I mostly accepted all non-conflicting changes from 1.13. An exception was that in many places where we were using `version.compareTo(other) < 0` or `version.compareTo(other) >= 0`, I accepted the changes from the cherry-pick commit to replace those with `version.isOlderThan(other)` or `version.isNotOlderThan(other)`. Those changes were all made by @pivotal-jbarrett on `develop` and they improve readability.\r\n\r\nI did not change `InternalDistributedMember.equals(other)`—instead, I pulled in a couple minor changes to `GMSJoinLeaveJUnitTest` from the `develop` branch, to get that test running with the (wrong/unchanged) `IDM.equals(other)` functionality. Since this ticket is not about fixing `IDM` this was the better way to go.\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

to `support/1.12` branch, of https://github.com/apache/geode/pull/5273 fix for [GEODE-8240](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GEODE-8240)\r\n\r\nI used `git cherry-pick -x bfe1ca113124ea958dc02dd9be90cdb0aabe5c4d`\r\n\r\nIn resolving conflicts I mostly accepted all non-conflicting changes from 1.12. An exception was that in many places where we were using `version.compareTo(other) < 0` or `version.compareTo(other) >= 0`, I accepted the changes from the cherry-pick commit to replace those with `version.isOlderThan(other)` or `version.isNotOlderThan(other)`. Those changes were all made by @pivotal-jbarrett on `develop` and they improve readability.\r\n\r\n~The other change I had to make was to fix the `equals(other)` method on `InternalDistributedMember`. That method didn't work when comparing a `InternalDistributedMember` to a `MemberIdentifier`. As a result the 1.12 version of `GMSJoinLeaveJUnitTest` was failing. Fixing `equals(other)` fixed the test. The alternative would have been a lot of surgery on that test (mocking.). Rather than perturb that test further, I left it alone and fixed `IDM.equals(other)`.~\r\n\r\nI did not change `InternalDistributedMember.equals(other)`—instead, I pulled in a couple minor changes to `GMSJoinLeaveJUnitTest` from the `develop` branch, to get that test running with the (wrong/unchanged) `IDM.equals(other)` functionality. Since this ticket is not about fixing `IDM` this was the better way to go.\r\n\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?

replaced the \"for\" loop using an implicit Iterator with one using an\r\nexplicit Iterator so that its safe \"remove()\" method can be used.  The\r\nIterator method is stated as being the only safe way to modify the\r\ncollection while iterating over its contents.\r\n\r\nI've also modified a test to validate the fix.  The test forces a\r\nfailure to send two messages to an address.  The failures are then\r\nhandled in the code that was throwing the\r\nConcurrentModificationException and, since there are two failures,\r\nit causes two removals to be performedon the failedMessages collection.\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
