Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when starting the Agent, ACS checks if the `cryptsetup` command can be used by using the command's `help`; the output of the command is printed in the logs. However, this output is too verbose and can be confusing.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by using the utility version to check the command, instead of `help`, which is much less verbose.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n-  Before changes:\r\n  \r\n![grep_usage_host-1](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/56271185/260ceae6-fad0-46fb-96c1-ffc6f55294b5)\r\n\r\n-  After changes:\r\n\r\n![grep_version_host-1](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/56271185/90c68e98-3f0b-4daf-805a-483902b57842)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI checked the logs before and after changes.

Description\r\n\r\nACS does not allow operators to set the configuration `storage.overprovisioning.factor` for `SharedMountPoint` primary storages, presenting the following message when one tries to change it:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/38945620/d27e9dec-1f1b-4b14-9b6c-e523708c9342)\r\n\r\nAlso, the global setting does not impact `SharedMoundPoint` primary storages, which means that the over-provisioning is not applied properly for this storage type. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the metric presents that the `SharedMountPoint` has the global over-provisioning applied; however, in a scenario where the over-provision factor is 2, the allocation threshold is 80%, and the metrics show that storage has 40% allocated, one cannot allocate to it anymore.\r\n\r\nThis PR intends to enable over-provisioning for `SharedMountPoint` primary storages.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing

(if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn an environment where the global over-provision factor was 1, the allocation threshold was 80%, and the `SharedMountPoint` primary storage had 80% allocated, I was able to change the over-provisioning factor of the `SharedMountPoint` primary storage and allocate a new volume on it, as, with the over-provisioning, ACS considered it as having 40% allocated.

Description\r\n\r\nCurrently, when starting the Agent, ACS checks if the `cryptsetup` command can be used by using the command's `help`; the output of the command is printed in the logs. However, this output is too verbose and can be confusing.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by using the utility version to check the command, instead of `help`, which is much less verbose.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n-  Before changes:\r\n  \r\n![grep_usage_host-1](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/56271185/260ceae6-fad0-46fb-96c1-ffc6f55294b5)\r\n\r\n-  After changes:\r\n\r\n![grep_version_host-1](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/56271185/90c68e98-3f0b-4daf-805a-483902b57842)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nI checked the logs before and after changes.

Description\r\n\r\n`hypervisor` and `hypervisorversion` parameters are added to the `updateHypervisorCapabilities` API.\r\nThis would allow updating capabilities by specifying the hypervisor type and its version. This would also allow creating new hypervisor capabilities entries in the database when they doesn't exist for a given hypervisor version.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/8412\r\n\r\nNew parameters as their description suggests are not meant to change the value of hypervisor and hypervisorversion of an existing capability. Rather they will be used to find the capabilities entry in the database and update other params such as maxdatavolumeslimit, maxguestslimit, maxhostspercluster, securitygroupenabled, storagemotionenabled, vmsnapshotenabled.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n(localcloud) 🐱 > list hypervisorcapabilities hypervisor=VMware filter=hypervisorversion,maxdatavolumeslimit\r\n{\r\n  \"count\": 21,\r\n  \"hypervisorCapabilities\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"default\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 13\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"4.0\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 13\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"4.1\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 13\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"5.0\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 13\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"5.1\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 13\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"5.5\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 13\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"6.0\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"6.5\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"6.7\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"6.7.1\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"6.7.2\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"6.7.3\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"7.0\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"7.0.1.0\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"7.0.2.0\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"7.0.3.0\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"8.0\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"8.0.0.1\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"8.0.1\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"8.0.0.2\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"hypervisorversion\": \"8.0.0.3\",\r\n      \"maxdatavolumeslimit\": 59\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.

Description\r\n\r\nAn ICMP ACL rule should not be able to have code and type null. This PR fixes an edge case, that can be reproduced by:\r\n\r\n- Creating a VPC and an ACL.\r\n- Creating a TCP rule.\r\n- Calling the API with `updateNetworkACLItem` and parameters `protocol=icmp`, `partialupgrade=false`, `cidrlist=\"\"` and `traffictype=ingress`.\r\n\r\nIt will then set the rule with null ICMP code and type and the VR will face problems. \r\n\r\nThis PR just extends the validation made when `partialupgrade` is false.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature

Description\r\n\r\nWhen listing disk offerings through the UI, IOPS and read/write data for these offerings is not presented, making it difficult to access information about them.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, `Disk Read Rate (IOPS)`, `Disk Write Rate (IOPS)`, `Disk Read Rate (BPS)`, `Disk Write Rate (BPS)` and `Max IOPS` data has been added to the disk offering details.\r\n\r\n### Types of

I created a disk offering with max IOPS using the `storage` QoS type in the creation form;\r\n3. I accessed these disk offerings and verified that the `Disk Read Rate (IOPS)`, `Disk Write Rate (IOPS)`, `Disk Read Rate (BPS)`, `Disk Write Rate (BPS)` data were in the disk offering created in the step 1 and the `Max IOPS` data was in the disk offering created in the step

functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [X] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the libvirt event processing to handle changes in Libvirt domains (and other events if registered).\r\n\r\nThere is some history around this. Initially it seems there was an event loop initialization added in an earlier [PR](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7408) that supports live block copy. This introduced `Library.initEventLoop();` to `LibvirtConnection`, however it never polled for events, and this caused the keepalive issue warned about by libvirt doc [here](https://libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt-event.html#virEventRegisterDefaultImpl):\r\n\r\n```\r\nFor proper event handling, it is important that the event implementation is registered before a connection to the Hypervisor is opened.\r\n\r\nOnce registered, the application has to invoke [virEventRunDefaultImpl](https://libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt-event.html#virEventRunDefaultImpl)() in a loop to process events. Failure to do so may result in connections being closed unexpectedly as a result of keepalive timeout.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus it was found that long running VM migrations would fail due to keep alive issues, which resulted in https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7945\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, [support for detecting out of band VM shutdowns](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/pull/7963) was being developed to also utilize events, and in parallel was relying on the above `Library.initEventLoop();` in `LibvirtConnection`.  This new feature added the missing polling, but ultimately doesn't work (fails gracefully to provide new event handling) because `Library.initEventLoop()` was lost in parallel.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the thread responsible for running the Libvirt event loop out of LibvirtComputingResource and into LibvirtConnection, and reintroduces `Library.initEventLoop()`, which shouldn't result in keep alive errors now that we are properly polling for events. It also sets up the event loop before any Libvirt connection as documentation requires.\r\n\r\nFinally, when a connection is tested using `conn.getVersion()`, if an exception is thrown we simply create a new connection (but no attempt is made to clean up the old connection). This was resulting in file handle leaks in cases such as the keep alive timeout that was causing connections to go stale, so now we try to close the connection before creating a new one.\r\n\r\n###

max user data content to 1048576 bytes (the size can be configurable through _vm.userdata.max.length_ setting, max 1048576), but it's limited due to the default Jetty max content size, which is 200000

Description\r\n\r\nDuring management server initialization, some `EmptyStackException` and `BeansException` exceptions are always thrown; These exceptions do not affect ACS, however, they can cause confusion when observing the management server startup logs with DEBUG level on. The causes of the exceptions have been addressed.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [X] Trivial\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nWithout the change, I started the MGMT server with debug logs on and saw the exceptions being logged.\r\nWith the change, I started the MGMT server and saw that no exceptions

Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fix ensures that when you have at least one Zone with a specific hypervisor type (e.g. KVM), then when adding a new Zone with the same hypervisor type, even if the systemVM template for that hypervisor (when registered in the original Zone) is not marked as cross_zone=1 (in vm_template table) - i.e. when it's not marked for \"ALL ZONES\" - CloudStack will created the record in the template_zone_ref table, and the rest of the work will be done by the automatic systemVM template installation script (that runs when a first Secondary Storage is added inside a new Zone)\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes moves resources stuck in transition state during async job cleanup\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\nDuring maintenance of the management server, other servers in the cluster or the same server after a restart initiate async job cleanup. However, this process leaves resources in a transitional state. The only recovery option currently available is to make direct database changes.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nThis PR introduces a resolution by changing  Volume, Virtual Machine, and Network resources from their transitional states. This adjustment enables the reattempt of failed operations without the need for manual database modifications.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally

Description\r\n\r\nFeature spec: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Granular+Resource+Limit+Management\r\n\r\nIntroduces the concept of tagged resource limits for granular resource limit management. Limits can be enforced on accounts and domains for the deployment of entities for a tagged resource. Current tagged resource limits can be used for the following resource types,\r\n\r\nHost limits\r\n    - user_vm\r\n    - cpu\r\n    - memory\r\n\r\nStorage limits\r\n    - volume\r\n    - primary_storage\r\n\r\nFollowing global settings can used to specify tags for which limit needs to be enforced,\r\n\r\n    Host: `resource.limit.host.tags`\r\n    Storage: `resource.limit.storage.tags`\r\n\r\nOption for specifying tagged resource limits and viewing tagged resource usage are made available in the UI.\r\n\r\nEnhances the use of templatetag for VM deployment and template creation\r\n\r\nAdds option to list service/compute offerings that can be used with a given template. A new parameter named `templateid` has been added.\r\n\r\nAdds option to list disk offering with suitability flag for a virtual machine. A new parameter named `virtualmachineid` has been added to the listDiskOfferings API which when passed returns `suitableforvirtualmachine` param in the response.\r\n\r\n**ToDo: Schema changes to be moved in 4.20 upgrade path**\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which

Description\r\n\r\nAfter re-creating a VR from a domain VPC, ACS will not apply static nat, port forward and load balancer rules to IPs that are not associated to the account that owns the VPC.\r\nAn adjustment was made to make sure that these rules are applied for all IPs when performing the following procedures:\r\n\r\n* VR restart\r\n\r\n* VPC restart\r\n\r\n* VPC restart with cleanup\r\n\r\n* recreate VR when health-check fails\r\n\r\n* recreate VR on failover\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [x]

Severity\r\n\r\nimprove the following issues\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/cloudstack/issues/8266\r\n\r\nFor vmstats data, the default global settings will cause a large amount of data to be stored in the database. When accessing the instance page, vmstats data will be requested, causing the page to open extremely slowly. Especially when multiple users access the instance page at the same time, the problem will be exacerbated.\r\nMy environment has about 200 running instances.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [x] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document -->\r\nBecause it is a modification of global settings, the test method is to directly modify the global parameters. The corresponding code modifications are for new deployments.

Description\r\n\r\nQuota tariffs have been extended to make it possible to define the order of their execution. To achieve this, the `position` parameter was added to the `quotaTariffCreate` and `quotaTariffUpdate` APIs. This parameter is used to define the tariff execution sequence of tariffs with the same usage type. This order is ascending, that is, a tariff with `position` equal to 1 will be executed before a tariff with `position` equal to 2. If two tariffs of the same usage type have equal positions, the most recent one will be executed first.\r\n\r\nDuring the processing of Quota tariffs, ACS will execute them in the defined order and inject the values ​​into subsequent rates. To enable tariff injection, the preset variable `lastTariffs` was created. It will have a list of objects containing the `id` and `value` attributes of the tariffs executed before it.

Description\r\n\r\nWhen a public IP gets removed from quarantine, the removal reason gets saved to the database; however, it may also be useful for operators to know who removed the public IP from quarantine. For that reason, this PR extends the public IP quarantine feature so that the account that deliberately removed a IP from quarantine also gets saved to the database. \r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. I set the configuration `public.ip.address.quarantine.duration` to 60 minutes;\r\n2. Through CloudMonkey, I logged into the domain admin account `A`, acquired an IP and released it. Then, I called `removeQuarantinedIp` to remove the IP from quarantine. Finally, I called `listQuarantinedIps` with `showremoved=true` and verified that the field `removeraccountid` in the corresponding quarantine entry contained `A`'s uuid;\r\n3. Through CloudMonkey, I logged into account `A`, acquired an IP and released it. Then, I logged into the root admin account and called `removeQuarantinedIp` to remove the IP from quarantine. Finally, I called `listQuarantinedIps` with `showremoved=true` and verified that the field `removeraccountid` in the corresponding quarantine entry contained the root admin's uuid.\r\n4. In account `A`, I acquired a public IP, released it and acquired it again.

Description\r\n\r\nAdmins are able to lock and unlock users through the APIs `lockUser` and `enableUser`; however, this feature is not currently available in the UI. To address this issue, this PR adds a button to the page of `Enabled` users which allows admins to lock them through the UI. Furthermore, when a user is `Locked`, the \"Enable User\" button is now visible for admins.\r\n\r\nThis PR also makes some changes in `AutogenView.vue` to allow the replacement of placeholders in `message`s and `successMessage`s of confirmation dialogs.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [X] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/25729641/54f6a80f-1de6-48f2-ab2a-72ceb7f8e74f)\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/assets/25729641/eb5dc680-ee4d-4ed7-98ac-8a3eda3cc456)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n1. In the root admin account, I accessed the page of an `Enabled` user and verified that the \"Lock User\" button was available;\r\n2. I clicked the \"Lock User\" button and verified that the user's state changed to `Locked`;\r\n3. I verified that the \"Enable User\" button was now visible.\r\n4. I clicked the \"Enable User\" button and verified that the user's state changed to `Enabled`;\r\n5. In an account that had the role `User`, I accessed the user's own page and verified that the \"Lock User\" button was not visible.\r\n\r\nRegarding the replacement of placeholders in `message`s and `successMessage`s of confirmation dialogs:\r\n- I verified that the warning (`message`) and success messages (`successMessage`) showed the user's name when locking a user;\r\n- I verified that existing dialogs did not change when the `message` field consisted of only a label;\r\n- I verified that existing dialogs did not change when the `message` field consisted of a function that returns a label;\r\n- I verified that existing dialogs did not change when the `successMessage` field consisted of only a

Description\r\n\r\nSometimes the hostStats object of the agents becomes null in the management server. It is a rare situation, and we haven't found the root cause yet, but it occurs occasionally in our CloudStack deployments with many hosts.\r\n\r\nThe hostStat is null, even though the agent is UP and hosting multiple VMs. It is possible to access the VM consoles and execute tasks on them.\r\n\r\nThis pull request doesn't address the issue directly; rather it displays those hosts in Prometheus so we can restart the agent and get the necessary information.\r\n\r\n<!--- Describe your changes in DETAIL - And how has behaviour functionally changed. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- For new features, provide link to FS, dev ML discussion etc. -->\r\n<!-- In case of bug fix, the expected and actual behaviours, steps to reproduce. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- When \"Fixes: #<id>\" is specified, the issue/PR will automatically be closed when this PR gets merged -->\r\n<!-- For addressing multiple issues/PRs, use multiple \"Fixes: #<id>\" -->\r\n<!-- Fixes: # -->\r\n\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n<!--- NOTE: AUTOMATION USES THE DESCRIPTIONS TO SET LABELS AND PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION. -->\r\n<!--- PLEASE PUT AN 'X' in only **ONE** box -->\r\n<!--- ******************************************************************************* -->\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [x] Major\r\n- [ ] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe in detail how you tested your changes. -->\r\n<!-- Include details of your testing environment, and the tests you ran to -->\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Set `prometheus.exporter.enable` to `true`.\r\n2. Execute `curl localhost:9595/metrics` on management server to make sure that prometheus is working.\r\n3. Stop any agent.\r\n4. Run `curl localhost:9595/metrics | grep cloudstack_host_missing_info` you get nothing in output cause the host state is still there. (If you wait for couple of minutes management server may remove it)\r\n5. Restart the management server to remove cashed host stats objects in the memory.\r\n6. Run `curl localhost:9595/metrics | grep cloudstack_host_missing_info` again to get the following output:\r\n```\r\ncurl localhost:9595/metrics | grep cloudstack_host_missing_info\r\ncloudstack_host_missing_info{zone=\"testZone1\",hostname=\"node01\",filter=\"hostStats\"} -1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\n<!-- see how your change affects other areas of the code, etc. -->\r\n\r\nThe change wouldn't affect other area of code as the prometheus module is somehow an independent part of the CloudStack.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) document

conventions\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nUpdates AutoScaleManager/AutoScaleManagerImpl so that getNextVmHostName and checkAutoScaleVmGroupName can be overridden in derivative implementations to allow for custom naming conditions and restrictions.  If possible, would like to include this in 4.19 since it is a trivial change.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Feature/Enhancement Scale\r\n\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [x] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nExtended implementation class with different VM names and tested for shorter auto-scale names.\r\n\r\n#### How did you try to break this feature and the system with this change?\r\n\r\nUse group names longer than the extended code allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please read the

Description\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the problem of not being possible to edit the Public property of a default role through the UI, since it sets the other fields as parameters of the API call and results in a `Default roles cannot be updated (with the exception of making it private/public).` error. \r\n\r\nIt solves this by simply limiting the available fields for default roles, since they are not possible to be edited in the first place and should not show up anyway. It does not change the window for non-default roles.\r\n\r\n### Types of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)\r\n- [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [ ] Enhancement (improves an existing feature and functionality)\r\n- [ ] Cleanup (Code refactoring and cleanup, that may add test cases)\r\n- [ ] build/CI\r\n\r\n### Feature/Enhancement Scale or Bug Severity\r\n\r\n#### Bug Severity\r\n\r\n- [ ] BLOCKER\r\n- [ ] Critical\r\n- [ ] Major\r\n- [X] Minor\r\n- [ ] Trivial\r\n\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate):\r\n\r\n\r\n### How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nIn the User default role, I verified that only the Public field showed up.
