Either way, we should fatally throw a more clear exception so the user can know what is wrong.\r\nI personally spent more time than I'm comfortable sharing debugging this issue and I'd like to see it improved.\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\nOn the first read of a `PlaintextTransportLayer` channel, we check against the pre-defined TLS alert headers, which consist of the alert byte `0x15` and the TLS version `0301`,`0302`, `0303`.\r\n\r\nI believe that it should be alright to close such responses since we would never expect to receive a 3mb response on the first response in a newly-established connection since we should at least verify `API_VERSIONS` first.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely certain whether this warrants creation of a KIP since we are raising a new exception - `InvalidTransportLayerException`.

java application now supports synchronous blocking sends to produce messages to kafka brokers.\r\n\r\nTill now, performance producer application supported only asynchronous sends with a callback function registered.\r\nthis would be enough when trying to load the kafka brokers without bothering much on the replication & producer responses.\r\n\r\nBut when kafka brokers replication capacity has to be loaded, asynchronous sends would not suffice.\r\nSo synchronous blocking send calls are now supported with all the existing metrics calculation of producer performance.\r\n\r\nA boolean command line flag --synchronous-send has been added to enable/disable this feature.\r\nBlocking .get() calls are now done upon each send, and as of this commit ResultMetadata is not being used or logged.\r\nA new function has been introduced in the Stats class to update and get the iteration counter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTests done:\r\n\r\nComparison tests were done with and without synchronous sends.\r\n\r\nbelow were the configurations of kafka cluster:\r\nNo of brokers: 3\r\nCPU per broker: 10 cores\r\nMemory : 32GB\r\nTopic partitions : 1\r\nreplication factor : 3\r\nmin.insync.replicas: 1 (default).\r\nproducer acks level : 1(default),  response after only leader write.\r\n\r\nSimilar configurations were given for performance producer with & without synchronous sends enabled.\r\nIt was observed that, synchronous producer was producing records approximately 5 times slower than asynchronous producer\r\nbut with guarantee of replication before subsequent sends.\r\n\r\nSo this clearly indicates the impact of replication in brokers. And these tests would help optimise resources in \r\nkafka broker from replication performance point of view.\r\n\r\nAttached results snapshot of performance producer run with/without synchronous send

Kafka Streams system tests fail with some regularity due to a timeout starting the broker.\r\n\r\nThe initial start is quite quick, but many of our tests involve stopping and restarting nodes with data already loaded, and also while processing is ongoing.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, it seems to be normal for the broker to take about 25 seconds to start, which makes the 30 second timeout pretty close for comfort.\r\nI have seen many test failures in which the broker successfully started within a couple of seconds after the tests timed out and already initiated the failure/shut-down sequence.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

and make sure the topic either exists or it's gone by using a delay.\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in the InternalTopicManager that makes the client believe that a topic exists even though it doesn't, it occurs mostly in those few seconds between when a topic is marked for deletion and when it is actually deleted. In that timespan, the Broker gives inconsistent information, first it hides the topic but then it refuses to create a new one therefore the client believes the topic was existing already and it starts polling for metadata.\r\n\r\nThe consequence is that the client goes into a loop where it polls for topic metadata and if this is done by many threads it can take down a small cluster or degrade greatly its performances.\r\n\r\nThe real life scenario is probably a reset gone wrong. Reproducing the issue is fairly simple, these are the steps:\r\n\r\nStop a Kafka streams application\r\nDelete one of its changelog and the local store\r\nRestart the application immediately after the topic delete\r\nYou will see the Kafka streams application hanging after the bootstrap saying something like: INFO  Metadata - Cluster ID: xxxx\r\n \r\n\r\nI am attaching a patch that fixes the issue client side but my personal opinion is that this should be tackled on the broker as well, metadata requests seem expensive and it would be easy to craft a DDOS that can potentially take down an entire cluster in seconds just by flooding the brokers with metadata requests.\r\n\r\nThe patch kicks in only when a topic that wasn't existing in the first call to getNumPartitions triggers a TopicExistsException. When this happens it forces the re-validation of the topic and if it still looks like doesn't exists plan a retry with some delay, to give the broker the necessary time to sort it out.\r\n\r\nI think this patch makes sense beside the above mentioned use case where a topic it's not existing, because, even if the topic was actually created, the client should not blindly trust it and should still re-validate it by checking the number of partitions. IE: a topic can be created automatically by the first request and then it would have the default partitions rather than the expected ones.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

recently needed to port the `Utils.murmur` hash function to Go for a project I'm working on. I realized there were no definite test cases for the Java implementation that I could use to tell me whether my ported implementation was correct and returned the same results as the code in this project. And although there is test coverage of this hash function by way of a caller in the `testKeyPartitionIsStable` unit in `DefaultPartitionerTest`, the granularity of the test there is not sufficient for any developer to write a reliable port in another language of choice.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I found someone who ran into the same trouble as me:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/48582589/porting-kafkas-murmur2-implementation-to-go\r\n\r\nwho provided test cases with their solution. I took the test cases from the above and codified them as unit test cases for this hash function in `UtilsTest`. In this way, any developer writing a custom Kafka client or server in any language can look at these reference cases to confirm the correctness of their implementations with absolute confidence that keys hashed with this murmur function (modulo some number of partitions) land on the right partition.\r\n\r\nAn open question to the maintainers (and to anyone with expertise in non-cryptographic hashing): do the cases I've given add enough surface area to cover the complete inner workings of this function's mappings?","created_at":"2018-11-18T19:29:45Z","updated_at":"2019-06-25T05:43:12Z","closed_at":"2019-06-25T05:43:12Z","merged_at":"2019-06-25T05:43:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"55707adaee992e835a67920e016376235b92b70f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5926/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5926/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5926/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/d3986589c8699ee8749c783aa52d5ca74a80513d","head":{"label":"natemurthy:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"d3986589c8699ee8749c783aa52d5ca74a80513d","user":{"login":"natemurthy","id":1788878,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODg4Nzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1788878?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy","html_url":"https://github.com/natemurthy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/natemurthy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"bebcbe3a049f78c4184404f2dfb8b4150233856e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

Selector currently reads all requests available on the socket when the socket is ready for read. These are queued up as staged receives. This can result in excessive memory usage when socket read buffer size is large. We mute the channel and stop reading any more data until all the staged requests are processed. This behaviour is slightly inconsistent since for the initial read we drain the socket buffer, allowing it to get filled up again, but if data arrives slighly after the initial read, then we dont read from the socket buffer until pending requests are processed. \r\n\r\nTo avoid holding onto requests for longer than required, this PR removes staged receives and reads one request at a time even if more data is available in the socket buffer. This is especially useful for produce requests which may be large and may take long to process. Additional data read from the socket for SSL is limited to the pre-allocated intermediate SSL buffers.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and

is a system test for doing a rolling upgrade of a topology with a named repartition topic.\r\n\r\n1. An initial Kafka Streams application is started on 3 nodes.  The topology has one operation forcing a repartition and the repartition topic is explicitly named.\r\n2. Each node is started and processing of data is validated\r\n3. Then one node is stopped (full stop is verified)\r\n4. A property is set signaling the node to add operations to the topology _**before**_ the repartition node which forces a renumbering of all operators (except repartition node)\r\n5. Restart the node and confirm processing records\r\n6. Repeat the steps for the other 2 nodes completing the rolling upgrade \r\n\r\nI ran two runs of the system test with 25 repeats in each run for a total of 50 test runs.\r\nAll test runs passed\r\n\r\n### [First 25 test

is a new system test testing for optimizing an existing topology.  This test takes the following steps\r\n\r\n1. Start a Kafka Streams application that uses a `selectKey` then performs 3 `groupByKey()` operations and 1 `join` creating four repartition topics\r\n2. Verify all instances start and process data\r\n3. Stop all instances and verify stopped\r\n4. For each stopped instance update the config for  `TOPOLOGY_OPTIMIZATION` to `all` then restart the instance and verify the instance has started successfully also verifying Kafka Streams reduced the number of repartition topics from 4 to 1\r\n5. Verify that each instance is processing data from the `aggregation`, `reduce`, and `join` operation\r\n6. Stop all instances and verify the shut down is complete.\r\n\r\nFor testing I ran two passes of the system test with 25 repeats for a total of 50 test runs.  \r\n\r\nAll test runs passed\r\n### [First

Previously, Connect would pass many of its worker configuration properties into the producer, consumer, and admin client used for internal topics, resulting in lots of log warnings about unused config properties.\r\n\r\nWith this change, Connect attempts to filter out the worker’s configuration properties that are not applicable to the producer, consumer, or admin client used for _internal_ topics. (Connect is already including only producer and consumer properties when creating those clients for connectors, since those properties are prefixed in the worker config.)\r\n\r\nFor the most part, this is relatively straightforward, since there are some top-level worker-specific properties that can be removed, and most extension-specific properties have Connect-specific properties. Unfortunately, the REST extension is the only type of connect extension that uses unprefixed properties from the worker config, so any it is not possible to remove those from the properties passed to the producer, consumer, and admin clients. Hopefully, REST extensions are prevalant yet, and this will mean most users may not see any warnings about unused properties in the producer, consumer, and admin client.\r\n\r\nRemoving the Connect worker configs is one step. The other is to remove the any properties for the producer that are specific to the consumer and admin client. Likewise, for the consumer we have to remove any properties that are specific to the producer and admin client, and for the admin client remove any properties that are specific to the producer and consumer. Note that any property that is unknown (e.g., properties for REST extension, interceptors, metric reporters, serdes, partitioners, etc.) must be passed to the producer, consumer, and admin client. All of these — except for the REST extension properties — should be used by both the producer and consumer. But, since the admin client only supports metric reporters, any properties for interceptors, serdes, partitioners and REST extension will also be logged as unused. Connect configures the serdes for the producers, so we're left with any custom properties for interceptors and partitioners still getting passed to the AdminClient, but this is about the best we can do at this point.\r\n\r\nAll of this filtering logic was added to the `ConnectUtils` class, allowing the logic to be easily unit tested and minimize changes to other existing code. All changes are limited to Kafka Connect, and will work with all client and Connect extensions (passing them to the clients if they are unknown). Also, note that when configuring the producers and consumers for connectors, Connect only uses the properties that begin with the `producer.` and `consumer.` prefixes, respectively.\r\n\r\nThis supersedes #5867 and #5802.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

when brokers join/leave the cluster without any partition states changes, controller will send out UpdateMetadataRequests containing the states of all partitions to all brokers. But for existing brokers in the cluster, the metadata diff between controller and the broker should only be the \"live_brokers\"/\"offline_replicas\" info. Only the brokers with empty metadata cache need the full UpdateMetadataRequest. Sending the full UpdateMetadataRequest to all brokers can place nonnegligible memory pressure on the controller side, especially for large clusters with many brokers and a large number of partitions.\r\n\r\nLet's say in total we have N brokers, M partitions in the cluster and we want to add 1 brand new broker in the cluster. With RF=2, the memory footprint per partition in the UpdateMetadataRequest is ~200 Bytes. In the current controller implementation, if each of the N RequestSendThreads serializes and sends out the UpdateMetadataRequest at roughly the same time (which is very likely the case), we will end up using (N+1)*M*200B memory. However, we only need to send out one full UpdateMetadataReuqest in this case. More detail can be found in the jira ticket KAFKA-7537.\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids sending out full UpdateMetadataReuqest in the following scenarios:\r\n1. On broker startup, send out full UpdateMetadataRequest to newly added brokers and only send out UpdateMetadataReuqest with empty partition states to existing brokers.\r\n2. On broker failure, if it doesn't require leader election, only include the states of partitions that are hosted by the dead broker(s) in the UpdateMetadataReuqest instead of including all partition states.\r\n\r\n_Note that after partition state change and replica state change, UpdateMetadataReuqests still need to be sent and this behavior remains unchanged after this PR._\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a minor optimization in the MetadataCache update to avoid copying the previous partition states upon receiving UpdateMetadataRequest with no partition states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###

These can be very misleading, because some conventional configuration properties for custom interceptors, key or value (de)serializers, metrics reporters, and partitioner are not actually defined by ConfigDefs and are thus all considered unused and logged as warnings.\r\n\r\nAlso, some client applications (such as Connect) do not determine the subset of properties that can be passed to one of these clients, since there are these custom extensions. This causes extra properties to be logged as warnings, which is concerning for new users.\r\n\r\nThese unused configurations should be logged at DEBUG level instead to reduce the number of unexpected warnings in many client application logs.\r\n\r\n### Backporting\r\nThis is a usability improvement that affects only this particular log message.

PR adds a new ConsumeBenchSpec field - \"consumerCount\". \"consumerCount\" will be spawned over \"consumerCount\" threads in the ConsumeBenchWorker.\r\nSince \"consumerCount\" will be 1 by default, these changes are backwards compatible\r\n\r\nIt's now questionable how existing fields such as \"targetMessagesPerSec\", \"maxMessages\", \"consumerGroup\" and \"activeTopics\" should work.\r\n\r\nWith \"activeTopics\", we need to decide whether they should be split over the consumers or not.\r\nI see 4 cases which I believe we should address like this:\r\n\r\n1. Random group, subscribe to topics - N unique groups all subscribed to all topics\r\n2. Specifed group, subscribe to topics - 1 group subscribed to all topics. Consumers share workload.\r\n3. Random groups, assign partitions - X groups all subscribed to all partitions\r\n4. Specified group, assign partitions - Throw an exception. Only one consumer can read from a specific partition within the context of a consumer group. It is then unclear how and whether at all we should split the partitions across the consumers. At this phase, I believe it's best to not support this.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe \"targetMessagesPerSec\", \"maxMessages\" should account for each consumer individually. This would ease implementation by a ton, too.\r\n\r\n\r\nI haven't written tests yet since I want to flesh out the design first.

Consumers share workload.\r\nRandom groups, assign partitions - X groups all subscribed to all partitions\r\nSpecific group, assign partitions - 1 group all subscribed to part of the partitions (split in a round-robin style)\r\nI believe \"targetMessagesPerSec\", \"maxMessages\" should account for each consumer individually. This would ease implementation too.","created_at":"2018-10-31T23:21:34Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T23:22:18Z","closed_at":"2018-10-31T23:22:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5863/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5863/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5863/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ff10cf94f2c143a01cb55ecb0ac7b9a87da76a10","head":{"label":"stanislavkozlovski:KAFKA_7514-consumer-bench-multiple-threads","ref":"KAFKA_7514-consumer-bench-multiple-threads","sha":"ff10cf94f2c143a01cb55ecb0ac7b9a87da76a10","user":{"login":"stanislavkozlovski","id":13639618,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNjM5NjE4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13639618?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski","html_url":"https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/stanislavkozlovski/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:trunk","ref":"trunk","sha":"8065a0bef41b6f3d0f8b0fcc01a008d7916ac5c6","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":2211243,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjExMjQz","name":"kafka","full_name":"apache/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/kafka","description":"Mirror

been seeing some hanging builds recently (see KAFKA-7553). Consistently the culprit seems to be a test case in PlaintextConsumerTest. This patch doesn't fix the underlying issue, but it eliminates a few places where these test cases could block:\r\n\r\n1. It replaces several calls to the deprecated `poll(long)` which can block indefinitely in the worst case with `poll(Duration)` which respects the timeout.\r\n2. It also fixes a consume utility in `TestUtils` which can block for a long time depending on the number of records that are expected to be consumed.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-30T20:39:54Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T22:51:03Z","closed_at":"2018-10-31T22:51:03Z","merged_at":"2018-10-31T22:51:03Z","merge_commit_sha":"8065a0bef41b6f3d0f8b0fcc01a008d7916ac5c6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5859/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5859/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5859/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/1198014b7845799d9ce9f4aa2933f8e20d85f610","head":{"label":"hachikuji:minor-fix-blocking-consumer-test","ref":"minor-fix-blocking-consumer-test","sha":"1198014b7845799d9ce9f4aa2933f8e20d85f610","user":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35842084,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTg0MjA4NA==","name":"kafka","full_name":"hachikuji/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji/kafka","description":"Mirror

believe that it'll be useful for debugging purposes to know which IP addresses are consistently failing authentication.\r\nApplications that consistently fail authentication can introduce CPU pressure to the broker and as such, I think it is useful for Ops teams to have the needed information to quickly block.\r\n\r\nI've left these logs on `DEBUG` level since I presume that most common cases won't require to know this information.

when we call KafkaConsumer.poll(), it will fetch data from Kafka asynchronously and is put in to a local buffer (completedFetches).\r\nIf now we pause some TopicPartitions and call KafkaConsumer.poll(), we might throw away any buffered data that we might have in the local buffer for these TopicPartitions. Generally, if an application is calling pause on some TopicPartitions, it is likely to resume those TopicPartitions in near future, which would require KafkaConsumer to re-issue a fetch for the same data that it had buffered earlier for these TopicPartitions. This is a wasted effort from the application's point of view.\r\n\r\nThe current patch does not throw away the already buffered data for paused partitions, but stores it in a separate buffer (pausedCompletedFetchesPerTopicPartition). If we have data in this separate buffer for a recently resumed partition, it is given higher preference as compared to other partitions.\r\n \r\nThe patch also makes sure that if we have data in this separate buffer (pausedCompletedFetchesPerTopicPartition) for a recently resumed partition, it will not send out another fetch request for that TopicPartition until that buffered data has been processed. This guarantees that we would have at the most 1 completedFetch buffered for a paused TopicPartition.\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-26T01:26:36Z","updated_at":"2019-08-02T00:12:50Z","closed_at":"2019-08-02T00:12:49Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ac19d6c19b6e96ba12f2ace760133fde8f798a65","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5844/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5844/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5844/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f6782834a1aa601651522e3d18a4c03a7e4abccf","head":{"label":"MayureshGharat:KAFKA-7548","ref":"KAFKA-7548","sha":"f6782834a1aa601651522e3d18a4c03a7e4abccf","user":{"login":"MayureshGharat","id":4326831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjY4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4326831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat","html_url":"https://github.com/MayureshGharat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43786685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mzc4NjY4NQ==","name":"kafka","full_name":"MayureshGharat/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MayureshGharat","id":4326831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjY4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4326831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat","html_url":"https://github.com/MayureshGharat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MayureshGharat/kafka","description":"Mirror
