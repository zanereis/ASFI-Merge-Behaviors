new script is proposed as part of Python integration testing to improve following aspects:\r\n- Support integration tests with Jenkins default configuration and customized configurations.\r\n- Many command line flags are provided to support more use cases.\r\n- Easy to integrate to Gradle.\r\n- Easy to add the support of running validates runner and validates container tests.\r\n\r\nBased on the new script, I created a Gradle task `integrationTest` which hopefully can be an ideal entry point to run any integration test. This task automatically setup the vertualenv, generate tar ball and run `run_integration_test.sh` with provided args. \r\n\r\nBy adding `integrationTest` task, Perfkit benchmark can use it to run integration tests with simpler setup. We can also get rid of [Beam virtualenv setup on Jenkins](https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/master/.test-infra/jenkins/CommonJobProperties.groovy#L343-L351) which currently fails [Python benchmark job](https://builds.apache.org/view/A-D/view/Beam/job/beam_PerformanceTests_Python/1433/). Corresponding changes to Perfkit is available [here](https://github.com/markflyhigh/PerfKitBenchmarker/pull/2/files).\r\n\r\nCommand built from Perfkit could be as simple as:\r\n```\r\n./gradlew beam-sdks-python:integrationTest \\\r\n-Pattr=IT \\\r\n-Ptests=apache_beam.examples.wordcount_it_test:WordCountIT.test_wordcount_it \\\r\n-PpipelineOptions=<pipeline options>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFuture work includes move rest of features in `run_postcommits.sh` to `run_integration_test.sh`, use `integrationTest` task in Jenkins Postcommit and performance jobs.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.\r\n - [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an Apache [Individual Contributor License

was a bug occurring when a Pipeline ran with portability enabled\r\nand a Combine.GroupedValues that wasn't wrapped in a Combine.PerKey.\r\nThe code for translating the Combine.GroupedValues would attempt to\r\ntranslate the parent as if it was a Combine.PerKey because it assumed\r\nthat all Combine.GroupedValues would be subtransforms.\r\n\r\nTo avoid that issue I'm adding a clause to the PTransformOverride for\r\nthat translation, so the translation will only occur if the parent of\r\nthe Combine.GroupedValues is a Combine.PerKey. Essentially, I'm forcing\r\nthe assumption to be true.\r\n\r\nAlong with those changes I'm also bundling in a few code quality,\r\nnaming, and comment changes to make the code I touched easier to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

particular, this change\r\n\r\n* Simplifies the aging out of old data. Not only was the old formula hard to\r\n  understand, but it meant that bad data could stick around and poison the\r\n  estimates forever.\r\n* Adds a variance parameter allowing the batch size to vary over a fixed\r\n  range giving a broader base for the linear regression.\r\n* Uses numpy when available to do the regression.  This is both much more\r\n  efficient and allows for less error-prone expression of more complicated\r\n  analysis.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm was also changed to:\r\n\r\n* Eliminates outliers, both using Cook's distance and just throwing out the\r\n  top (often high-variance and high-influence) 20% when there is sufficient\r\n  data.\r\n* Weight by the inverse of batch size, to provide a more stable fixed size\r\n  estimate (which the default \"overhead\" target is sensitive to).\r\n\r\nThese changes were tested against a large TFT pipeline and found to produce\r\nmore uniform batch sizes and similar, possibly slightly improved, total\r\nruntimes and total costs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

changes in this commit:\r\n  * Decoupled rendering from pipeline_graph into pipeline_graph_renderer\r\n  * Enabled setting render options when instantiating an interactive_runner.\r\n\r\nThe options include\r\n  * mute: not render anything\r\n  * text: render the pipeline graph as text\r\n  * graph: render the pipeline graph using pydot. This option is\r\ndependent on  graphviz\r\n\r\nThe default behavior prior to this commit is to use the third option\r\n(graph), which is problematic when the users are running the IPython\r\nkernel in an environment without graphviz.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

can be used to force processing to wait for another stage to complete, when a direct PCollection dependency does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe unit test only checks pass-through correctness.  I have tested the actual sequencing on DirectRunner and FlumeRunner, and believe the mechanism should be portable to other runners.\r\n\r\nThis could also be added as a call on ParDo, but providing a standalone PTransform seemed cleaner.\r\n\r\nThe series of operations adds more to the execution graph than I'd like; a dotted-line dependency would be better.

many Java portable VR tests by improving the check for primitive transforms, per Slack discussion with @lukecwik \r\n\r\nSeveral unittests are still failing; I've marked them with `@Ignore` to flag for discussion here. I fixed several tests by making sure every transform has a spec with a URN set, but I'm not clear what URN to use in some of the remaining cases (and it's possible some that I've added are misleading, e.g. [for side-inputs](https://github.com/apache/beam/pull/6328/files#diff-c7f0848ce3c30d2707ca5cc6d8e33b8aR949)).\r\n\r\nHere are the results of running the Java Flink portable VR

the moment, there is only `HadoopInputFormatIO` in Beam. To provide a support of different writing IOs, that are not yet natively supported in Beam (for example, Apache Orc or HBase bulk load), this PR adds new Java IO `HadoopOutputFormatIO` which allows to write data to any sink which implements Hadoop OutputFormat. \r\n\r\nIt is developed as a separate IO module `hadoop-output-format` to avoid a confusion with a name of already existed module `hadoop-input-format`. Perhaps, in the next versions of Beam we should merge them into one common `HadoopFormatIO` module.\r\n\r\nIt was tested by unit tests and integration test (with `DBOutputFormat`) that were incorporated into this PR as well.\r\n\r\nUPD: Following a discussion on dev@ it was decided to merge the modules `hadoop-input-format` and `hadoop-output-format` into one module, it will be called just `hadoop-format`. Also, in the end, we will have one IO class called `HadoopFormatIO` which supports `Write` and `Read` by using `InputFormat` and `OutputFormat` accordingly. This PR is the first step in this merging - it creates new module `hadoop-format` which supports only `Write` for the moment. Next step will be to move the code from `hadoop-input-format` into this module and add support of `Read` too, `hadoop-input-format` will become deprecated after that. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily:\r\n\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.
