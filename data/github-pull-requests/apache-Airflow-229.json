a fresh install of Windows Subsystem for Linux (Ubuntu 20.04), created a conda environment and tried to follow the above guide  to install airflow but was getting gcc errors.

caching is now default strategy when building\r\nthe Production image.\r\n\r\nYou can still change it to pulled - similar to CI builds\r\nby providing the right build flag and this is what\r\nis used in CI by default. The flags in Breeze are now updated\r\nto be more eplanatory and friendly (build-cache-*) and a flag\r\nfor \"disabled\" cache option is added as well.\r\n\r\nAlso the Dockerfile and Dockerfile.ci files are not needed\r\nany more in the docker context. They used to be needed when\r\nwe built the Kubernetes image in the container, but since\r\nwe are now using production image directly - we do not need\r\nthem any nmore.\r\n\r\nCombining setting the default strategy to local and removing\r\nthe Dockerfile from the context has the nice effect that you\r\ncan iterate much faster on the Production image without\r\ntriggering rebuilds of half of the docker image\r\nas soon as the Dockerfile changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit

       This is to emit the true scheduling delay stats, which is defined as the time when the first\r\n        task in DAG starts minus the expected DAG run datetime. This method will be used in the update_state method\r\n        when the state of the DagRun is updated to a completed status (either success or failure).\r\n        The method will find the first started task within the DAG and calculate the expected DagRun start time (\r\n        based on dag.execution_date & dag.schedule_interval), and minus these two to get the delay.\r\n\r\n        The emitted data may contains outlier (e.g. when the first task was cleared, so the second task's start_date\r\n        will be used), but we can get ride of the the outliers on the stats side through the dashboards.\r\n\r\n        Note, the stat will only be emitted if the DagRun is a scheduler triggered one (i.e. external_trigger is False).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is all useful when you want to even measure executor delays, considerations for adding more capacity, adding more scheduling processes, etc. Measuring just the delay in the dagrun from its start time to expected time is just one of the measurement, but measuring from the dag run to its first real running job is important as well.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above

PR adds another option to update DAGs for the official helm chart for Airflow. It uses [git-sync](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync) to update DAGs.\r\n\r\n**Related ISSUE**: [issue #9528](https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/9528)\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you use the official [Airflow Helm Chart](https://github.com/apache/airflow/tree/master/chart) the only way to update DAGs is to build a new Airflow image. Building a new Airflow Image and deploying every time when there is a change in DAG seems like overkill. So I propose updating DAGs by using [git-sync](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync)\r\n>git-sync is a simple command that pulls a git repository into a local directory. It is a perfect \"sidecar\" container in Kubernetes - it can periodically pull files down from a repository so that an application can consume them.\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below

to change colors**:\r\n\r\nCreate `airflow_local_settings.py` file and put in on PYTHONPATH. (example put that file under `$AIRFLOW_HOME/config/airflow_local_settings.py` with the following contents:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nSTATE_COLORS = {\r\n    \"queued\": 'darkgray',\r\n    \"running\": '#01FF70',\r\n    \"success\": '#2ECC40',\r\n    \"failed\": 'firebrick',\r\n    \"up_for_retry\": 'yellow',\r\n    \"up_for_reschedule\": 'turquoise',\r\n    \"upstream_failed\": 'orange',\r\n    \"skipped\": 'darkorchid',\r\n    \"scheduled\": 'tan',\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Screenshots with the above

accepted](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/eb403beea2d1035635b7bea24c49b6b964313e51/airflow/models/baseoperator.py#L359), it need not be mentioned in the docstring here since it is referring to

fixes the bug reported in https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/9514\r\n\r\nWhat happened:\r\n\r\nIn example_external_task_marker_dag.py, after the Dags have been run over multiple dates, when the user clears parent_task on the first execution_date with Future, Downstream and Recursive selected, the current behaviour is that Airflow clears the parent dag tasks over all execution_dates, but only clears the first execution_date of the child dag.\r\n\r\nWhat you expected to happen:\r\nAirflow should clear all tasks on the parent DAG and child DAG over all execution_dates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR: [x]\r\n\r\n- [x] Description above provides context of the change\r\n- [x] Unit tests coverage for changes
