However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin \n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n##

this pull request, I have implemented the TaskAllocationStrategy to schedule tasks equally on cluster. \nI ran multiple tests on my cluster including the PI example and my own algorithm and everything

In the screenshot you can see the equal distribution in cluster with each machine only running 2 tasks.\n![roundrobin-18 tasks-9
