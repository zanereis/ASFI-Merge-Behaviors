converter doesn't gracefully handle the situation when a pytorch op has multiple outputs but the converter function only returns a single output.\r\n\r\n* Fix specific case I encountered for `aten::max_pool2d_with_indices` by adding converter which returns a second dummy output.\r\n* Also, improve handling of the situation by using `outputs[_get_output_name(op_node)] = relay_out` instead of `outputs[node_name] = relay_out` so that the assert in `_get_output_name` will be hit instead of a confusing key error later on. When a pytorch op has multiple outputs, node_name is a concatenation of all of the output names so downstream operators would never be able to find the specific output in `outputs` that they

PR introduces WebGPU support to tvm. The WebGPU runtime is directly built in javascript(as WebGPU is a first-class js API) and exposes back to the tvm's runtime via PackedFuncs.\r\n\r\nOne important note is that `ctx.sync` is now async. This is due to the fact that WebGPU is a purely async API and we cannot block in the web environment.\r\n\r\nSo the current best way to use the js api is to wrap things in an async function. When copy a GPU array to CPU, `await ctx.sync()` need to be called to wait for copy completion.\r\n\r\nWe use a AsyncIO rpc server to serve the async functions to the clients.\r\n\r\n## Limitation\r\nSo far the webgpu runtime only takes in buffer arguments(so not dynamic shape arguments like n)\r\n\r\nRight now we use the SPIRV to generate shaders that can be accepted by Chrome and Firefox.\r\n\r\n- Obtain a browser that support webgpu.\r\n  - So far only Chrome Canary on MacOS works\r\n  - Firefox should be close pending the support of Fence.\r\n- Download and build tvm with vulkan SDK (1.1 or higher) that supports SPIRV 1.3\r\n- Start the WebSocket RPC in the browser\r\n- run `python tests/node/webgpu_rpc_test.py`","created_at":"2020-05-08T17:33:17Z","updated_at":"2020-05-09T23:59:19Z","closed_at":"2020-05-09T23:59:19Z","merged_at":"2020-05-09T23:59:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"cdc7ae492e1ce30f6080d9567eecf89c97ed939f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5545/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5545/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5545/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/23fbdeb26b4b9669110d152d7e40e80eedee01b4","head":{"label":"tqchen:webgpu","ref":"webgpu","sha":"23fbdeb26b4b9669110d152d7e40e80eedee01b4","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.gi

the RPCServer is in the async IO mode, it is possible for the server\r\nto directly serve async function that may return its value via a callback in the future.\r\nThis mode is particular useful to the web environment, where blocking is not an option.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the Async support to the RPCSession, allowing the AsyncIO driven servers\r\nto serve the async functions. These functions will still be presented as synchronized version\r\non the client side.\r\n\r\nFollowup PR will refactor the web runtime to make use of this

Implement `getNextString` to break up ~~`std::string`~~`stringstream` into words. Operator `>>` on `stringstream` just doesn't work on Android.\r\n- `string::find_last_of` doesn't look for the last substring, but the last character from a given string.\r\n- Use `SIGTERM` to terminate processes (this isn't necessary, but using `SIGKILL` is not a good practice).\r\n- Convert `./rpc` to a full path.

objects that the raw pointers point to can be deallocated and new objects can be allocated at the same address, all while these pointers are still in the cache. This can lead to unexpected behavior, for example to calculated bound conflicts with previously cached values.\r\n\r\nInternally, we have observed build failures caused by this with a message like\r\n```\r\nTVMError: Check failed: (val->second->min_value == res.min_value && val-second->max_value == res.max_value) || (val->second->min_value == everything.min_value && val->second->max_value == everything.max_value): Detected bound for 31conflicts with memorization\r\n```\r\n\r\nNone of the below is applicable anymore.  The patch is reduced to simply replacing the raw pointers with `PrimExpr` objects, which is sufficient on its own.  The additional features have been removed.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\nCaching `ObjectPtr` will prevent the objects from being deallocated while the cache is active.\r\n\r\nThis PR has a few parts:\r\n1. Allowing `ObjectPtr` objects to point to `const` objects.  Since most object pointers are const-qualified, this will avoid casting constness away.  The reference counter was explicitly marked as `mutable` to allow counting references for const objects as well.\r\n2. Allowing `GetObjectPtr` to automatically create `ObjectPtr` with the type corresponding to the input argument.  Explicit template arguments still work as before, but are no longer needed when the `ObjectPtr` simply wraps the argument type.\r\n3. Finally, caching `ObjectPtr<const PrimExprNode>` in the bound analyzer.","created_at":"2020-05-06T19:46:25Z","updated_at":"2020-05-07T18:23:17Z","closed_at":"2020-05-07T18:18:27Z","merged_at":"2020-05-07T18:18:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"f05b9119e0612df59172301bdfbe4fabcd8605e9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5533/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5533/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5533/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/5be426be0bee718605be3b9c669d8aff1452c4aa","head":{"label":"kparzysz-quic:memo","ref":"memo","sha":"5be426be0bee718605be3b9c669d8aff1452c4aa","user":{"login":"kparzysz-quic","id":48801706,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4ODAxNzA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48801706?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic","html_url":"https://github.com/kparzysz-quic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kparzysz-quic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"900254d3425ba728dacbf8e5e0ce29fce8eccd3f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

working on TFLite Frontend ops, It was observed that most of the common code can be refactored to a single place.\r\nFor example below are few redundant things:\r\n- Input and Output tensor checks\r\n- Getting operator options\r\n- Getting Relay expressions for input tensors\r\n- Quantized check\r\n- Fusing activation functions\r\n\r\nThis PR is a POC to refactor tflite frontend. It adds a decorator which does all the things mentioned above. Currently, this PR demos the decorator for one operator only. I would like to hear opinions from the community about this approach and then once we decide on an approach/design we can refactor all the operators.\r\n\r\nThis change will allow new developers to quickly add new operators. Plus it will help reviewers also as new devs like me can not make obvious mistakes.

plan on sending an RFC tomorrow on the greater refactor but my goal is to restructure the current Rust code into 4 crates:\r\n- `tvm-sys` containing the lowest level bindings to `libruntimetvm.dylib`\r\n- `tvm-rt` a layer which provides a ergonomic Rust layer over the primitive concepts exposed by `tvms-sys`.\r\n- `tvm` a high level crate for using the full TVM library including the compiler components. \r\n- `tvm-graph-rt` previously the `runtime` a library a ABI compatible Rust implementation of the graph runtime. \r\n\r\nI was attempting to refactor this in one go, but have found my current branch is rapidly reaching a few thousand lines.\r\n\r\nI will first send it in pieces to be reviewed and merged, and then follow up with connecting PRs to put the pieces together, turn on CI, and replace the existing code. \r\n@binarybana @robo-corg @mwillsey @vegaluisjose @MarisaKirisame @mbrookhart

plan on sending an RFC tomorrow on the greater refactor but my goal is to restructure the current Rust code into 4 crates:\r\n- `tvm-sys` containing the lowest level bindings to `libruntimetvm.dylib`\r\n- `tvm-rt` a layer which provides a ergonomic Rust layer over the primitive concepts exposed by `tvms-sys`.\r\n- `tvm` a high level crate for using the full TVM library including the compiler components. \r\n- `tvm-graph-rt` previously the `runtime` a library a ABI compatible Rust implementation of the graph runtime. \r\n\r\nI was attempting to refactor this in one go, but have found my current branch is rapidly reaching a few thousand lines.\r\n\r\nI will first send it in pieces to be reviewed and merged, and then follow up with connecting PRs to put the pieces together, turn on CI, and replace the existing code.

is a draft PR and only for discussion but not for merging as is.\r\n\r\nThese are a couple of commits that show a proof of concept about how we could restructure and improve the tflite frontend. I've lightly tested these by compiling a couple of tflite models to give me some confidence that they work.  If this looks reasonable I'm happy to pull things out into separate individual pull requests that could allow us to migrate to this with newer operators that get added and refactor the existing operators in a piecemeal fashion with time and availability of folks.\r\n\r\nThe first commit tries to make the tflite operator table more data driven, the observation being that the common case is that of input and output operands being subject to an equality check that we can commonize into the top level. This means we can reduce the number of individual checks in every helper function and thus making it simpler for our developers to add new operators.\r\n\r\nThe second commit here shows another aspect of the tflite frontend which is the use of asserts instead of using tvm.error . If we have a set of errors that can be raised by the various frontends attached to tvm, we should use them more efficiently. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRamana\r\n\r\n@tqchen , @anijain2305 , @FrozenGene -

PR introduces a brand new TVM web runtime based on the WASM standard API.\r\nMain highlights:\r\n\r\n- The new runtime is rewritten using the Typescript.\r\n- The new runtime now directly interfaces with WebAssembly's standard API,\r\n  instead of relying on emscripten's API.\r\n  This change will make the js runtime more portable to runtime variants.\r\n  For example, we could also try to make it interface with the tvm's rust runtime implementation.\r\n- System library can be provided through WASI\r\n  - We also build a hack to enable Emscripten to generate a WASI like\r\n    bundle for runtime environment on the Web.\r\n- The wasm generation now uses the mainlin LLVM.\r\n- Dynamic link(dlopen) is not used due to limitation of wasm,\r\n  instead we rely on the recent new RPC refactor to directly\r\n  restart a new session for each wasm binary sent to the RPC.","created_at":"2020-05-04T04:28:52Z","updated_at":"2020-05-14T15:11:10Z","closed_at":"2020-05-07T20:47:37Z","merged_at":"2020-05-07T20:47:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"702fd0f0f4ef283dedac3e65e71455ca4661a8e3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5506/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/5506/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/5506/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/bbe428c717cb3d3da863c452fb42e8b2059bd09b","head":{"label":"tqchen:web","ref":"web","sha":"bbe428c717cb3d3da863c452fb42e8b2059bd09b","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100638323,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2MzgzMjM=","name":"tvm","full_name":"tqchen/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen/tvm","description":null,"fork":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm","forks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/forks","keys_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/keys{/key_id}","collaborators_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/collaborators{/collaborator}","teams_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/teams","hooks_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/hooks","issue_events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/events{/number}","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/events","assignees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/assignees{/user}","branches_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/branches{/branch}","tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/tags","blobs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/blobs{/sha}","git_tags_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/tags{/sha}","git_refs_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/refs{/sha}","trees_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/trees{/sha}","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/statuses/{sha}","languages_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/languages","stargazers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/stargazers","contributors_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contributors","subscribers_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscribers","subscription_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/subscription","commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/commits{/sha}","git_commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/git/commits{/sha}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/comments{/number}","issue_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/issues/comments{/number}","contents_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/contents/{+path}","compare_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/compare/{base}...{head}","merges_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/merges","archive_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/{archive_format}{/ref}","downloads_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/tqchen/tvm/downlo

PR refactors the RPC protocol to make it more modularized.\r\n\r\n- RPCSession: represent a set of features that need to be implemented\r\n- RPCEndPont: End point that forwards the RPCSession requests over a communication channel.\r\n- RPCModule: Exposes an RPCSession as an rpc device in the TVM Runtime API.\r\n\r\nIn the new design, the local machine is presented as a special case of RPCSession.\r\nThe remote is just another client session that calls into RPCEndPoint.\r\nThe RPC communication path is as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclient -> ClientSession -> EndPoint[client@n0]\r\n-> networking[between n0 <=> n1]\r\n-> EndPoint[server@n1] -> LocalSession[@n1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the new modular design, we can now chain more sessions together.\r\nFor example, we can now run the following proxy setup (testcase in test_runtime_rpc.test_session_constructor).\r\n\r\n```\r\nclient -> ClientSession -> Endpoint[client@n0]\r\n-> networking[between n0 <=> n1]\r\n-> Endpoint[server@n1] -> ClientSession -> Endpoint[client@n1]\r\n-> networking[between n1 <=> n2]\r\n-> Endpoint[server@n2] -> LocalSession[@n2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can also implement other types of Sessions.\r\nFor example, we could make uTVM session a special case of the RPCSession\r\nand use the same mechanism for session management.\r\n\r\nWe also add more comments about the internal of the RPC.\r\nThe communication protocol is simplfied using a similar convention as PackedFunc.\r\nThis allows us to further reduce the amount of special remote syscalls.\r\n\r\nDue to the major improvement and simplification, we are making a non-compatible update to the RPC protocol. It means that the client and server needs to be upgraded to together in order for it to function correctly.\r\n\r\nThis PR also introduces a versioning mechanism to the current RPC procotol,\r\nso

Several Points\r\n1.

If ref A is put in META, ref B is contained in A, then when we need to print ref B we print its META.\r\n3. Now only the `node` in `AttrStmt` may be put in META except that `node` is `StringImm/Var/Buffer/IterVar`.\r\n4. Print the Type of vars when we first encounter them on the tree.\r\n5. This PR hasn't combine relay's printer with tir's printer. I put several choices here for combined API for discussion.\r\n- add an `astext` member function for IRModule: we only do mix printing when printing an IRModule. Keep `relay.astext` and `tir.astext` separate for other uses.\r\n- merge relay's printer & tir's printer into one printer and use only one API `ir.astext`\r\n\r\ncc @tqchen @Hzfengsy \r\n\r\n##

PR does multiple things\r\n\r\n* **FP32 object detection model** - Adding test for TFLite FP32 object detection. The model is uploaded to dmlc/web-data with this PR - https://github.com/dmlc/web-data/pull/247\r\n* **Quantized object detection model**\r\n   * **Fused activations** - Added the code for fused activations. It calculates the clip off points given scale and zero point\r\n   * **End to end test** - Added the TFLite hosted quantized coco model - https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/object_detection/overview\r\n* **Flexbuffer parsing** - Flexbuffer parsing is improved\r\n\r\n#### Caveats\r\n* Though TVM and TFLite output for quantized model is close (all bounding boxes are predicted correctly with close probability scores and bounding box locations), they are not exactly equal. Therefore, I had to lower the tolerance to 1e-2. This is because of differences in TFLite and TVM rounding which is getting tackled here - https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/pull/4828. Additionally, the output tensors are sorted based on scores, but there can be different TVM and TFLite ordering when multiple bounding boxes have exactly the same score (typically for low scores). Therefore, the test compares only those bounding boxes which have score > 0.6 (a threshold is typically used in end to end applications to discard low score bounding boxes)\r\n\r\n* We cannot run the quantized TFLite test in CI due to a known LLVM bug - https://discuss.tvm.ai/t/segfault-in-llvm/3567. We can resolve this by adding device flags like `mcpu=core-avx2', but this does not work well with CI. Therefore, the test is skipped for now.\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-30T00:46:24Z","updated_at":"2020-05-08T03:18:54Z","closed_at":"2020-05-08T03:18:19Z","merged_at":"2020-05-08T03:18:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"786dfb6ab62094911202578acb23bea612dd4a91","assignee":{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"FrozenGene","id":7287321,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyODczMjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7287321?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene","html_url":"https://github.com/FrozenGene","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/FrozenGene/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":858776587,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTg3NzY1ODc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/labels/status:%20accepted","name":"status:

added a new pass to convert `tvm_if_then_else` intrinsics to `IfThenElse` statments. For example:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\na[i] = tvm.te.if_then_else(x < y, x, y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nis now\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nif (x < y) {\r\n    a[i] = x;\r\n} else {\r\n    a[i] = y;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\n\r\n- `tvm_if_then_else` intrinsics can now enjoy the optimizations of the `LoopPartition` pass after tagged as `likely`. (My condition-heavy sparse application gains up to 2.85x speedup)\r\n- Code lines containing `tvm_if_then_else` is often too long to read. This improves readability.\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- Add an `IfThenElseIntrinToStmt` pass, which runs just before `LoopPartition`. (**Question 1: Should I run this pass with `simple_mode` on?** Currently no. I don't know if the users like the IR to be more similar to what they write, or the lines to be not too long)\r\n- Added a test for the pass.\r\n- Enable access to the `likely` node in the Python API.\r\n- Fixed the breaking `ThreadSync` pass since it did not allow synchronizing threads in a conditional branch, which may be legal when there are synchronizations in both the then-case and the else-case, like the code piece below. Currently I simply deleted the branch check. (**Question 2: Any better way?**)\r\n```cuda\r\nif (...) {\r\n    __syncthread();\r\n    a[i] = x;\r\n} else {\r\n    __syncthread();\r\n    a[i] = y;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n- Fixed the breaking `LowerWarpMemory` pass by adding an extra branching, which handles the situation where there are only allocates of but no stores into a warp memory.\r\n\r\nAlgorithm for `IfThenElseIntrinToStmt`:\r\n\r\n1. Find a statement.\r\n2. Find the out-most `tvm_if_then_else` intrinsic in it.\r\n3. Put the statement into a new `IfThenElse` statement, and remove the out-most `tvm_if_then_else` intrinsic.\r\n4. Recurse until no more `tvm_if_then_else`.\r\n\r\nRequesting reviews and thanks in advance. @tqchen @ZihengJiang
