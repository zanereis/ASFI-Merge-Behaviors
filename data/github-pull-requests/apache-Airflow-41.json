https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/40039\r\n\r\n## What\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40478, we introduce a new class `DatasetAlias`, which allows emitting `DatasetEvent`s or creating `Dataset`s in a task. This PR allows us to schedule a DAG run based on `DatasetAlias`.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith DAG(dag_id=\"dataset-producer\"):\r\n    @task(outlets=[Dataset(\"example-alias\")])\r\n    def produce_dataset_events():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\nwith DAG(dag_id=\"dataset-alias-producer\"):\r\n    @task(outlets=[DatasetAlias(\"example-alias\")])\r\n    def produce_dataset_events(*, outlet_events):\r\n        outlet_events[\"example-alias\"].add(Dataset(\"s3://bucket/my-task\"))\r\n\r\nwith DAG(dag_id=\"dataset-consumer\", schedule=Dataset(\"s3://bucket/my-task\")):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nwith DAG(dag_id=\"dataset-alias-consumer\", schedule=DatasetAlias(\"example-alias\")):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the example above, before the DAG \"dataset-alias-producer\" is executed, the dataset alias `DatasetAlias(\"example-alias\")` is not yet resolved to `Dataset(\"s3://bucket/my-task\")`. Consequently, completing the execution of the DAG \"dataset-producer\" will only trigger the DAG \"dataset-consumer\" and not the DAG \"dataset-alias-consumer\". However, upon triggering the DAG \"dataset-alias-producer\", the `DatasetAlias(\"example-alias\")` will be resolved to `Dataset(\"s3://bucket/my-task\")`, and it will produce a dataset event that triggers the DAG \"dataset-consumer\". At this point, `DatasetAlias(\"example-alias\")` is resolved to `Dataset(\"s3://bucket/my-task\")`. Therefore, completing the execution of either DAG \"dataset-producer\" or \"dataset-alias-producer\" will trigger both the DAG \"dataset-consumer\" and \"dataset-alias-consumer\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

This feature was present in the sync mode, but was not originally included into the deferrable mode.\r\n\r\n- Update the return values of the operators in the deferrable mode to return only the model data instead of the training pipeline data.

above the dashes. -->\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nI recently had a huge pain point with Airflow running on ECS via the official airflow Docker image (`apache/airflow:2.9.2`).\r\n\r\nFor the configuration I have a scheduler (4 vCPU, 8 Gib), some workers (4 vCPU, 8 Gib) and a webserver (2 vCPU, 4 Gib).\r\n\r\nEvery containers are sharing the same environment variables to apply the same configuration anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that at some point, the scheduler were non-stop crashing with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFile \"\"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job_runner.py\"\", line 1738, in _find_zombies\r\n self.job.executor.send_callback(request)\r\nFile \"\"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/airflow/executors/base_executor.py\"\", line 499, in send_callback\r\n self.callback_sink.send(request)\r\nFile \"\"/home/airflow/.local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/airflow/callbacks/pipe_callback_sink.py\"\", line 47, in send\r\n self._get_sink_pipe().send(callback)\r\nFile \"\"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/multiprocessing/connection.py\"\", line 206, in send\r\n self._send_bytes(_ForkingPickler.dumps(obj))\r\nFile \"\"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/multiprocessing/connection.py\"\", line 427, in _send_bytes\r\n self._send(header + buf)\r\nFile \"\"/usr/local/lib/python3.12/multiprocessing/connection.py\"\", line 384, in _send\r\n  n = write(self._handle, buf)\r\n     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nBlockingIOError: [Errno 11] Resource temporarily unavailable\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first attempt was to increase the maximum file descriptor for the `airflow` user from 1000 (default) to 65535 (root limit) which works some time but after some days the problem came back.\r\n\r\nAfter many (many) unsuccessful attempts, I saw some content related with this error and the gevent patching.\r\n\r\nThe webserver is using `AIRFLOW__WEBSERVER__WORKER_CLASS=gevent` so it naturally came with `_AIRFLOW_PATCH_GEVENT=1`.\r\n\r\nAs the environment variables are shared between all containers, it means that the `_AIRFLOW_PATCH_GEVENT` environment variable was applied on the webserver but **also on the scheduler**.\r\n\r\nI'm not a Python expert but the conclusion was that the gevent patching was affecting the `multiprocessing` module via the duplex sockets then causing troubles on the scheduler internal communications.\r\n\r\nAs it was a painful problem to solve I'm proposing this documentation upgrade to warn anyone to apply this setup.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it's the right way to do it but feel free to take/modify/close this merge request the way you want, as it can already serve anyone searching for this error via Google.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful

This is a preparation for a new PR that will introduce an SQLInsertRowsOperator, which will be a convenient operator allowing you to insert rows using an operator instead of the need to use a PythonOperator in combination with the already existing insert_rows method of the DbApiHook, that way it will be directly possible to pass an XCom containing the rows to persist to the operator which aren't directly feasible by using the GenericTransfer operator, for example in the case of have to download data from a REST endpoint and persisting it directly to a database.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

This was already done within the DbApiHook itself in the fix for [PR 40615](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/40615).

even though reattach_states={'PENDING', 'RUNNING'} parameter is set and Job is still running, ValueError: Job already begun is thrown.\r\n\r\nAttaching to DONE job, which according to documentation shouldn't be possible (from airflow doc: if job with given id already exists then it tries to reattach to the job if its not done and its state is in reattach_states. If the job is done the operator will raise AirflowException.), but throws an error, as well as with any other Job type because of the validation in [job._begin() call](https://github.com/googleapis/python-bigquery/blob/cf920f458bf2779b66656640ab730534bcf7b567/google/cloud/bigquery/job/base.py#L731) and fails if it's different than None.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by adding checks of the current state before going to execute the Job in deferrable or synch mode.\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

default, a botocore session creates and caches an instance of JSONDecoder which consumes a lot of memory.  This issue was reported here https://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/3078. In the context of triggers which use boto sessions, this can result in excessive memory usage and as a result reduced capacity on the triggerer.  We can reduce memory footprint by sharing the loader instance across the sessions.\r\n\r\nIdea for the solution here comes from this comment:\r\nhttps://github.com/boto/botocore/issues/3078#issuecomment-1847613111\r\n\r\nDef let me know if you see any concerns with this.\r\n\r\nBelow here is memory utilization shown before and

release manager does not accept version change, they can select a new \"type\" of change to override one coming from the individual change assesment. The previous version applied the change-selection first and then further bump was based on that original update which lead to the case that when something was classified as feature first, and bugfix later had both - minor and patchlevel versions upgraded.\r\n\r\nThis change preserves the original content of provider yaml and in case of selecting \"no\" by the release manager, the original yaml content is used to make a subsequent version bump. We need to restore the original content and clear package metadata cache in order to restore the old version.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

Users now need to click back to return to the UI, it gets more tricky when you've clicked so many links on the docs page. This is same for the [prompt ](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/e827bfbd2c79f3432411e14351c245a06410766a/chart/values.yaml#L247)that comes up when no webserverSecretKey has been set. \r\n\r\n**Included**: Also open provider links in new tab.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\nSimply enrich the <a href></a> html tags to open in a new tab, easier to modify this via jinja.\r\n\r\n**Concerns:** As at today, we have very few external links directly in the Menu Bar. Coincidentally containing \"apache\", if this changes in future, then users would experience the same issue.\r\n- For third party provider links, this implementation ensures that no referrer/origin information is sent to the external website, improving security of user platforms.\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request Guidelines](https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/main/contributing-docs/05_pull_requests.rst#pull-request-guidelines)** for more information.\r\nIn case of fundamental code changes, an Airflow Improvement Proposal ([AIP](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/Airflow+Improvement+Proposals)) is needed.\r\nIn case of a new dependency, check compliance with the [ASF 3rd Party

dynamic determination of which extra link to include for the EmrServerlessStartJobOperator does not work with templated fields, since that evaluation was happening at DAG parsing time. This dynamic determination has been completely removed because:\r\n\r\n1) If using templated fields for some inputs it needed, DAG parsing\r\n   would fail.\r\n2) Changing the DAG definition relating to those links, would often\r\n   remove links for all previous DAG runs.\r\n3) It overly complicates the code.\r\n\r\nThe new behaviour is to add all links to the TI and only those that are enabled will be \"persisted\" (i.e. actually have a link) and those that are not will be present but greyed out and will link back to the TI (the Airflow default).\r\n\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-07-05 10-50-23](https://github.com/apache/airflow/assets/65743084/01df1ba6-4db1-4211-83b3-8cbcd9f59051)\r\n\r\nfixes #40103\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

The most use case after these changes do not work.\r\nFor example in one of our system tests for video intelligence operator we have this operation for GCSToGCS:\r\n```\r\nsrc_Bucket=B1, src_file=video/cat.mp4\r\nto dst_Bucket=B2, dst_file=video.mp4\r\n```\r\nand now the result of this operation is `B2/video.mp/cat.mp4`, but the expected result should be `B2/video.mp4`.\r\n\r\n<!--

If we like what I did here, I'll do the same for the others.  Please triple check my unit test changes to make sure I didn't inadvertently break the underlying mocks.\r\n\r\nFor the tenacity part of the change, note that I did away with the idea of using exponential backoff from the previous attempt (for now??) and just re-implemented the existing sleep(2) as a tenacity retry to align it with the other methods in this module which were already converted to tenacity.  We may go back to trying different retry periods later, but for now that part of the change is just for consistency.\r\n\r\n@dstandish and @potiuk :  You both made good suggestions in the previous attempt at this, let me know what you think.

doesn't support query parameters. Query parameters should always be supported to discourage string-formatting, which can introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nThe attack surface of BigQueryCheckOperator is basically non-existent. However, using query parameters everywhere is a matter of common sense and good housekeeping. A user of the module shouldn't have to choose query parameters for one operator and string formatting for the other; we should always support the safe route, which is through query parameters.\r\n\r\nTo add support, we'll imitate BigQueryExecuteQueryOperator's approach of adding a `query_params` argument to the constructor of BigQueryCheckOperator. An alternative approach would have been to make it possible to pass in `configuration` as  BigQueryInsertJobOperator does, but that would have other breaking changes (like making the `sql` argument redundant).\r\n\r\nCloses:

This PR adjusts it, so that the behaviour is the same regardless of deferrable mode being on or off.\r\nThis PR also adds ExternalQueryRunFacet for Athena job and fixes the problem where the whole extraction failed if one of the columns in Athena was missing a description.\r\n\r\nThere is also something i'd like to discuss. Right now, the output datasets are different between START and COMPLETE events. When passing `output_location=\"s3://<bucket>/dir/` to AthenaOperator, \r\n\r\nin START event we get one output: `Dataset(namespace=\"s3://<bucket>\", name=\"dir\")`\r\n\r\nin COMPLETE event we get two outputs: `Dataset(namespace=\"awsathena://athena.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\", name=\"AwsDataCatalog.<db>.<table>\")` and `Dataset(namespace=\"s3://<bucket>\", name=\"dir/tables/2ee1bfeb-4c67-4f50-a49d-df5deeb5f034\")`.\r\n\r\nIt's because in COMPLETE we are using the output from the API, so we know the exact location in S3 where the output has been saved so we replace whatever user has provided with what we get from the API. I wonder if it's something we expected and should stay like this or maybe we should somehow change that, to make it consistent in both events? I believe some people are using this first dataset based on [this](https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/issues/2699) issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes.

`providers.amazon.aws.hooks.s3.S3Hook`, it is currently not possible to run the `copy_object` method without an ACL policy.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the doc, the copy_object method will default to the canned ACL \"private\". Despite the capability to not write ACL in load/upload methods, It is not possible to copy without an ACL when implemented as such.\r\n\r\nThis change adds the capability to not write ACL on the destination object.\r\nSince many users may rely on the default value being private, I suggest we used an explicit value that would remove the ACL.\r\nThe explicit value suggested: \"no-acl\". This value is not a [Canned ACL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/acl-overview.html#canned-acl) so we are not conflicting with any provider value.
