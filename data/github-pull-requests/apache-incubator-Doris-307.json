Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #13615 \r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThe pr implements the function:\r\n1. Added parsing of grouping sets, rollup and cube.\r\n2. grouping sets that implement the new optimizer.\r\n3. Implement grouping and grouping_id functions.\r\n\r\n**TODO**:\r\n\r\n1. Implementation of cube and rollup.\r\n2. Scenarios for groupBy with predicate pushdown added.\r\n\r\n**Implementation details:**\r\nAdd the abstract class of LogicalGroupBy in the new optimizer, and the subsequent LogicalGroupingSets, LogicalGroupCube and LogicalRollUp will inherit from this abstract class.\r\n\r\nAdd the LogicalGroupBy operator between aggregate and scan, and finally convert the operator into RepeatNode in PhysicalPlanTranslate.\r\n\r\n**Eg:**\r\n```sql\r\nselect sum(k2), grouping(k1) from t1 group by grouping sets((k1));\r\n```\r\nparse:\r\n```\r\nLogicalProject \r\n->\r\nLogicalAggregate \r\n(outputExpressions: sum(k2), grouping(k1); groupByExpressions: empty)\r\n ->\r\nLogicalGroupBy \r\n(outputExpressions: sum(k2), grouping(k1); groupingSets: k1; groupByExpressions: k1)\r\n-> \r\nLogicalScan\r\n```\r\n\r\nanalyze:\r\n```\r\nLogicalProject \r\n->\r\nLogicalAggregate \r\n(outputExpressions: sum(k2), grouping(k1); groupByExpressions: k1, GROUPING_ID(), GROUPING_PREFIX(k1))\r\n ->\r\nLogicalGroupBy \r\n(outputExpressions: sum(k2), grouping(k1); groupingSets: k1; groupByExpressions: k1, GROUPING_ID(), GROUPING_PREFIX(k1))\r\n-> \r\nLogicalScan\r\n```\r\n\r\nrewrite:\r\n```\r\nLogicalProject \r\n->\r\nLogicalAggregate \r\n(outputExpressions: sum(k2), grouping(k1); groupByExpressions: k1, GROUPING_ID(), GROUPING_PREFIX(k1))\r\n ->\r\nLogicalProject\r\n(projections: k1, k2, GROUPING_ID(), GROUPING_PREFIX(k1))\r\n->\r\nLogicalGroupBy \r\n(outputExpressions: k1, k2, GROUPING_ID(), GROUPING_PREFIX(k1); groupingSets: k1; groupByExpressions: k1, GROUPING_ID(), GROUPING_PREFIX(k1))\r\n-> \r\nLogicalScan\r\n```\r\ntranslate:\r\n```\r\n * The function of toLongValues is to display the virtual value corresponding to virtualSlot.\r\n * For extra generated columns:\r\n *  Rule: The column corresponding to groupingIdList is a non-null column,\r\n *        and the value is 0, and the rest are null columns, and the value is 1.\r\n *\r\n * For groupingFunc columns:\r\n *  Rules:\r\n *      grouping: Only one parameter is allowed,\r\n *                when the column is an aggregation column, it is set to 1, otherwise it is 0.\r\n *      grouping_id: Multiple columns are allowed,\r\n *                   and the decimal result is returned based on the bitmap of the aggregated column.\r\n *\r\n * eg:\r\n * select k1, grouping(k1), grouping(k1, k2) from t1 group by grouping sets ((k1), (k1, k2), (k3) ());\r\n * nonVirtualGroupingExprs: [k1, k2, k3]\r\n * virtualSlotRefs: GROUPING_ID(), GROUPING_PREFIX_K1(k1), GROUPING_PREFIX_K1_K2(k1, k2)\r\n * bitSetAll: {0, 1, 2}\r\n * groupingIdList: [{0}, {0, 1}, {2}, {}]\r\n *\r\n * GROUPING_ID():\r\n * For {0}: k1 is set to 0, k2 and k3 are set to 1.\r\n * +----+----+----+\r\n * | k1 | k2 | k3 |\r\n * +----+----+----+\r\n * | 0  | 1  | 1  |\r\n * +----+----+----+\r\n * convert binary to decimal, the result is 3.\r\n *\r\n * And so on, The corresponding list of GROUPING_ID() is [3, 1, 6, 7]\r\n *\r\n * GROUPING_PREFIX_K1(k1):\r\n * For {0}:\r\n * +----+\r\n * | k1 |\r\n * +----+\r\n * | 0  |\r\n * +----+\r\n * And so on, The corresponding list GROUPING_PREFIX_K1(k1) is [0, 0, 1, 1]\r\n *\r\n * GROUPING_PREFIX_K1_K2(k1, k2):\r\n * For {0}:\r\n * +----+----+\r\n * | k1 | k2 |\r\n * +----+----+\r\n * | 0  | 1  |\r\n * +----+----+\r\n * convert binary to decimal, the result is 1.\r\n *\r\n * And so on, The corresponding list GROUPING_PREFIX_K1_K2(k1, k2) is [1, 0, 3, 3]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n3. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n4. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n6. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nCurrently, Doris has a variety of readers for different file formats,\r\nsuch as parquet reader, orc reader, csv reader, json reader and so on.\r\n\r\nThe interfaces of these readers are not unified, which makes it impossible to call them through a unified method.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I added a `GenericReader` interface class, and other Readers will implement this interface class\r\nto use the `get_next_block()` method.\r\n\r\nThis PR currently only modifies `arrow_reader` and `parquet reader`.\r\nOther readers will be modified one by one in subsequent PRs.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n    - [x] No Need\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick

Proposed changes\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n`ParquetReader` spends a lot time on hdfsSeek:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19337507/189920276-1a185c72-424b-4815-8dcc-05051cba237c.png)\r\nThere are two reasons why the hdfs reader frequently trigger the seek function:\r\n1.  The `readAt` and `seek` function of `HdfsFileReader` don't reset the right file position after reading or seeking.\r\n2.  `ParquetColumnReader`s of a row group reuse the same `HdfsFileReader`, the file position must seek to the each column when reading a page.\r\n### Solution\r\n1. Fix the bug of file position of `HdfsFileReader`\r\n2. Create a new file reader for the column. To prevent too many connections to hdfs, build a file readers pool, the column will reuse the previous file reader when the pool if full\r\n### Effect\r\nThe end-to-end query time of TPCH-Q1 has been reduced from 48s to 18s. The hdfsSeek disappears on the flame diagram:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19337507/189923778-1532cff8-269f-4ffd-b230-ae03ff9b8fee.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n4. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n5. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n6. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n7. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] Yes (If Yes, please explain WHY)\r\n    - [x] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at [dev@doris.apache.org](mailto:dev@doris.apache.org) by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered,

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\n当前的doris的version信息就是一个可以自定义的字符串，对于有进行版本信息比较的场景不太友好。目前根据之前的命名规则，以及可能得其他信息，对version信息进行了拆分，分成了prefix、major、minor、patch、rc信息等几个单独的信息。\r\n并且在fe和be上各增加了两个http接口，方便用户获取与版本相关的所有信息，用户可以根据这些信息去进行版本判断、分析、比较等行为。\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] No\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n3. Has document been added or modified:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n4. Does it need to update dependencies:\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n5. Are there any changes that cannot be rolled back:\r\n    - [ ] No\r\n\r\n## Further comments\r\n\r\nIf this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion at

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIn an earlier PR #11976 , we add shuffle join and bucket shuffle support. But if join's right child's distribution spec satisfied join's require, we do not add distribute on right child. Instead of, do it in plan translator.\r\nIt is hard to calculate accurate cost in this way, since we some distribute cost do not calculated.\r\nIn this PR, we introduce a new shuffle type BUCKET, and change the way of add enforce to ensure all necessary distribute will be added in cost and enforcer job.\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSupport function registry.\r\n\r\nThe classes:\r\n- BuiltinFunctions: contains the built-in functions list\r\n- FunctionRegistry: used to register scalar functions and aggregate functions, it can find the function by name\r\n- FunctionBuilder: used to resolve a BoundFunction class, extract the constructor, and build to a BoundFunction by arguments(`List<Expression>`)\r\n\r\nRegister example: you can add built-in functions in the list for simplicity\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class BuiltinFunctions implements FunctionHelper {\r\n    public final List<ScalarFunc> scalarFunctions = ImmutableList.of(\r\n            scalar(Substring.class, \"substr\", \"substring\"),\r\n            scalar(WeekOfYear.class),\r\n            scalar(Year.class)\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    public final ImmutableList<AggregateFunc> aggregateFunctions = ImmutableList.of(\r\n            agg(Avg.class),\r\n            agg(Count.class),\r\n            agg(Max.class),\r\n            agg(Min.class),\r\n            agg(Sum.class)\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- Currently, we only support register scalar functions add aggregate functions, we will support register table functions.\r\n- Currently, we only support resolve function by function name and difference arity, but can not resolve the same arity override function, e.g. `some_function(Expression)` and `some_function(Literal)`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\nOriginally, Order By Limit returned a maximum of 65535 rows of data by default during the query, but now many businesses do not apply this limit. It is necessary to add larger data after the query statement to complete the full data query, which is extremely inconvenient, so adjustments have been made.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I added the variable DEFAULT_ORDER_BY_LIMIT to the SessionVariable, the default value is -1, if the user does not use the LIMIT keyword or the LIMIT value is a negative integer, the default query return value is Long.MAX_VALUE. If the corresponding maximum query value is set, the number of data items is returned according to the maximum query value or the value followed by the LIMIT keyword.\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nDescribe your changes.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\nFirst step of #12303 \r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nThis is the first step for supporting rollup index selection for aggregate/unique key OLAP table.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to select rollup index when the aggregate node is present and the aggregate function matches the value type. So pre-aggregation is turned on by default.  Cases that pre-aggregation should be turned off will be addressed in the next PR.\r\n\r\nMain steps for rollup index selection: \r\n\r\n1. filter rollup indexes with all the required columns.\r\n2. filter rollup indexes that match the key prefix most.\r\n3. order the rollup indexes by row count, column count, rollup index id.\r\n\r\nTODO remaining:\r\n1. address cases that pre-aggregation should be turned off. (next PR)\r\n2. add more test cases. \r\n\r\nRefactor\r\n- Add `Project.getSlotToProducer` to extract a map from the project output slot to its producing expression.\r\n- Add `Filter.getConjuncts` to split the filter condition to conjunctive predicates.\r\n- Move the usage of `ExpressionReplacer` to `ExpressionUtils.replace(expr, replaceMap)` to simplify the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1.

Proposed changes\r\n\r\nIssue Number: close #xxx\r\n\r\n## Problem summary\r\n\r\nIn Nereids, we could not distinguish two relation from same table in one PlanTree.\r\nThis lead to some trick code to process them when do plan. Such as a separate branch to do equals in GroupExpression.\r\nThis PR add RelationId to LogicalRelation and PhysicalRelation. Then all relations equals function will compare RelationId to help us distinguish two relation from same table.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\nadd relation id to UnboundRelation, UnboundOneRowRelation, LogicalOneRowRelation, PhysicalOneRowRelation.\r\n\r\n## Checklist(Required)\r\n\r\n1. Does it affect the original behavior: \r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] I don't know\r\n2. Has unit tests been added:\r\n    - [ ] Yes\r\n    - [x] No\r\n    - [ ] No Need\r\n3.
