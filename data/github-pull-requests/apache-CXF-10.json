PR adds support for Micrometer Observation instrumentation of Apache CXF.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This PR is heavily influenced by Brave's implementation.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n- Adds micrometer tracing\r\n- Adds zipkin sender\r\n\r\nCXF metrics project\r\n- Now also does tracing (TODO: maybe this should be done in a separate module?)\r\n- Adds dependency on `rt-management` since metrics will now also be related to tracing \r\n- Adds dependency to Micrometer Observation\r\n- Is a copy of the Brave Tracing module but adopted to Micrometer Observation API\r\n- Uses low and high cardinality tags basing on OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions for RPC and HTTP (JaxRs) from 19.07.2023. VERY IMPORTANT: This doesn't mean that this project is OTel Semantic Convention compliant!!!\r\n- Uses `ObservationDocumentation` that using https://micrometer.io/docs/observation#_documentation_generation could generate asciidoctor documentation of observability data\r\n\r\nSpring Boot\r\n- adds `MicrometerObservationAutoConfiguration` that registers `Feature`s as beans\r\n\r\nTests\r\n- reused existing Brave tests with Micrometer Observation, altered existing tagging and naming defaults to make the test pass with Brave tagging and naming defaults\r\n- reused existing Boot tests to additionally assert observation based metrics and traces\r\n\r\nTODO ? :\r\n- maybe the code shouldn't be in CXF metrics module but a completely separate one?\r\n- add Javadocs?\r\n- add documentation - where should it be added?\r\n\r\nScreenshots from Zipkin:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-07-19

This reverses a change from <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a> that inadvertently led to stricter validation of some URI values. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1705\">#1705</a></li>\n<li>Gracefully handle invalid URIs when fingerprinting. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1694\">#1694</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.4 - 24 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema file to the latest from <a href=\"https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/123e95847b13fbdd4cbe2120fa5e33355d4a042b/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json\">oasis-tcs/sarif-spec</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a></li>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May 2023 that will disable Python dependency installation for new users of the CodeQL Action. This improves the speed of analysis while having only a very minor impact on results. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1676\">#1676</a></li>\n<li>We are improving the way that <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">CodeQL bundles</a> are tagged to make it possible to easily identify bundles by their CodeQL semantic version. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1682\">#1682</a>\n<ul>\n<li>As of CodeQL CLI 2.13.4, CodeQL bundles will be tagged using semantic versions, for example <code>codeql-bundle-v2.13.4</code>, instead of timestamps, like <code>codeql-bundle-20230615</code>.</li>\n<li>This change does not affect the majority of workflows, and we will not be changing tags for existing bundle releases.</li>\n<li>Some workflows with custom logic that depends on the specific format of the CodeQL bundle tag may need to be updated. For example, if your workflow matches CodeQL bundle tag names against a <code>codeql-bundle-yyyymmdd</code> pattern, you should update it to also recognize <code>codeql-bundle-vx.y.z</code> tags.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove the requirement for <code>on.push</code> and <code>on.pull_request</code> to trigger on the same branches. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1675\">#1675</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.3 - 04 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1664\">#1664</a></li>\n<li>You can now configure CodeQL within your code scanning workflow by passing a <code>config</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action. See <a href=\"https://aka.ms/code-scanning-docs/config-file\">Using a custom configuration file</a> for more information about configuring code scanning. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1590\">#1590</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.2 - 27 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.1 - 26 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.0 - 21 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1649\">#1649</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.8.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1618\">#1618</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.12 - 13 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Include the value of the <code>GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT</code> environment variable in the telemetry sent to GitHub. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1640\">#1640</a></li>\n<li>Improve the ease of debugging failed runs configured using <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically\">default setup</a>. The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup.

href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases\">unboundid-ldapsdk's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java 6.0.9</h2>\n<p>We have just released version 6.0.9 of the <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk\">UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</a>. It is available for download from <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/releases\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/files/\">SourceForge</a>, and it is available in the <a href=\"https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/com.unboundid/unboundid-ldapsdk/6.0.9\">Maven Central Repository</a>.</p>\n<p>As announced in the previous release, the LDAP SDK source code is now maintained only at GitHub. The SourceForge repository is still available for its <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/ldap-sdk/discussion/1001257/\">discussion forum</a>, <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/ldap-sdk/mailman/\">mailing lists</a>, and <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/ldap-sdk/files/\">release downloads</a>, but the source code is no longer available there.</p>\n<p>You can find the release notes for the 6.0.9 release (and all previous versions) at <a href=\"https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html\">https://docs.ldap.com/ldap-sdk/docs/release-notes.html</a>, but here’s a summary of the changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We made it possible to customize the set of result codes that the LDAP SDK uses to determine whether a connection may no longer be usable. Previously, we used a hard-coded set of result codes, and that is still the default, but you can now override that using the <code>ResultCode.setConnectionNotUsableResultCodes</code> method.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>HTTPProxySocketFactory</code> class that can be used to establish LDAP and LDAPS connections through an HTTP proxy server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>SOCKSProxySocketFactory</code> class that can be used to establish LDAP and LDAPS connections through a SOCKSv4 or SOCKSv5 proxy server.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the <code>ldap-diff</code> tool to add a <code>--byteForByte</code> argument that can be used to indicate that it should use a byte-for-byte comparison when determining whether two attribute values are equivalent rather than using a schema-aware comparison (which may ignore insignificant differences in some cases, like differences in capitalization or extra spaces). Previously, the tool always used byte-for-byte matching, but we decided to make it a configurable option, and we determined that it is better to use schema-aware comparison by default.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We fixed an issue in which a non-default channel binding type was not preserved when duplicating a GSSAPI bind request. We also added a <code>GSSAPIBindRequest.getChannelBindingType</code> method to retrieve the selected channel binding type for a GSSAPI bind request.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a <code>ResultCode.getStandardName</code> method that can be used to retrieve the name for the result code in a form that is used to reference it in standards documents.  Note that this may not be available for result codes that are not defined in known specifications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a mechanism for caching the derived secret keys used for passphrase-encrypted input and output streams so that it is no longer necessary to re-derive the same key each time it is used. This can dramatically improve performance when the same key is used multiple times.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the <code>StaticUtils.isLikelyDisplayableCharacter</code> method to consider additional character types to be displayable, including modifier symbols, non-spacing marks, enclosing marks, and combining spacing marks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>StaticUtils.getCodePoints</code> method that can be used to retrieve an array of the code points that comprise a given string.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>StaticUtils.unicodeStringsAreEquivalent</code> method that can be used to determine whether two strings represent an equivalent string of Unicode characters, even if they use different forms of Unicode normalization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>StaticUtils.utf8StringsAreEquivalent</code> method that can be used to determine whether two byte arrays represent an equivalent UTF-8 string of Unicode characters, even if they use different forms of Unicode normalization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We added a new <code>StaticUtils.isValidUTF8WithNonASCIICharacters</code> method that can be used to determine whether a given byte array represents a valid UTF-8 string that contains at least one non-ASCII character.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the client-side support for the collect-support-data administrative task to make it possible to specify the start and end times for the set of log messages to include in the support data archive.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We updated the documentation so that the latest versions of draft-melnikov-sasl2 and draft-melnikov-scram-sha-512 are included in the set of LDAP-related specifications.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Changelog</summary>\n<p><em>Sourced from <a href=\"https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/blob/master/docs/release-notes.html\">unboundid-ldapsdk's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre><code>          &lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>${TARGET=&quot;offline&quot;}                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LDAP SDK Home Page<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n${TARGET=&quot;offline&quot;}                <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Product Information<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<pre><code>          &lt;h2&gt;Release Notes&lt;/h2&gt;\n<pre><code>      &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Version 6.0.9&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;\n\n      &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n        The following changes were made between the 6.0.8 and 6.0.9 releases:\n      &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n      &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          The LDAP SDK source code will now only be updated on GitHub and will no longer\n          be maintained on SourceForge.  The SourceForge repository will still be\n          available for historical releases, but the trunk has been replaced with a README\n          file indicating that updated code is now only on GitHub.  It required effort to\n          keep both repositories in sync, and GitHub is removing its support for acting as\n          a Subversion repository, which that synchronization process relied upon.  The\n          SourceForge project will still be updated with downloads for new releases, and\n          the discussion forums and mailing lists will remain available.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Added an option for customizing the set of result codes that the LDAP SDK may\n          use to determine whether a connection may no longer be usable.  Previously, it\n          used a hard-coded set of result codes for this purpose, and that set is still\n          the default, but it is now possible to override that with a provided set of\n          result codes.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Added a new HTTPProxySocketFactory class that can be used to allow establishing\n          LDAP and LDAPS connections through an HTTP proxy server, and added a new\n          SOCKSProxySocketFactory class that can be used to allow establishing connections\n          through a SOCKSv4 or SOCKSv5 proxy server.  Communication with the proxy server\n          itself must be unencrypted (although communication with the target LDAP server\n          may optionally be end-to-end encrypted with TLS), and the proxy server must not\n          require authentication.\n          &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;\n        &amp;lt;/li&amp;gt;\n\n        &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;\n          Updated the ldif-diff tool to add a --byteForByte argument that can be used to\n          indicate that it should not ignore differences between source and target entries\n</code></pre>\n<p></code></pre></p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This reverses a change from <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a> that inadvertently led to stricter validation of some URI values. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1705\">#1705</a></li>\n<li>Gracefully handle invalid URIs when fingerprinting. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1694\">#1694</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.4 - 24 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated the SARIF 2.1.0 JSON schema file to the latest from <a href=\"https://github.com/oasis-tcs/sarif-spec/blob/123e95847b13fbdd4cbe2120fa5e33355d4a042b/Schemata/sarif-schema-2.1.0.json\">oasis-tcs/sarif-spec</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1668\">#1668</a></li>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in May 2023 that will disable Python dependency installation for new users of the CodeQL Action. This improves the speed of analysis while having only a very minor impact on results. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1676\">#1676</a></li>\n<li>We are improving the way that <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases\">CodeQL bundles</a> are tagged to make it possible to easily identify bundles by their CodeQL semantic version. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1682\">#1682</a>\n<ul>\n<li>As of CodeQL CLI 2.13.4, CodeQL bundles will be tagged using semantic versions, for example <code>codeql-bundle-v2.13.4</code>, instead of timestamps, like <code>codeql-bundle-20230615</code>.</li>\n<li>This change does not affect the majority of workflows, and we will not be changing tags for existing bundle releases.</li>\n<li>Some workflows with custom logic that depends on the specific format of the CodeQL bundle tag may need to be updated. For example, if your workflow matches CodeQL bundle tag names against a <code>codeql-bundle-yyyymmdd</code> pattern, you should update it to also recognize <code>codeql-bundle-vx.y.z</code> tags.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove the requirement for <code>on.push</code> and <code>on.pull_request</code> to trigger on the same branches. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1675\">#1675</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.3 - 04 May 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.1. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1664\">#1664</a></li>\n<li>You can now configure CodeQL within your code scanning workflow by passing a <code>config</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action. See <a href=\"https://aka.ms/code-scanning-docs/config-file\">Using a custom configuration file</a> for more information about configuring code scanning. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1590\">#1590</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.3.2 - 27 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.1 - 26 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.3.0 - 21 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.13.0. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1649\">#1649</a></li>\n<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.8.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1618\">#1618</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.12 - 13 Apr 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Include the value of the <code>GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT</code> environment variable in the telemetry sent to GitHub. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1640\">#1640</a></li>\n<li>Improve the ease of debugging failed runs configured using <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/configuring-code-scanning-for-a-repository#configuring-code-scanning-automatically\">default setup</a>. The CodeQL Action will now upload diagnostic information to Code Scanning from failed runs configured using default setup. You can view this diagnostic information on the <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-the-tool-status-page\">tool status page</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1619\">#1619</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.2.11 - 06 Apr 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.2.10 - 05 Apr 2023</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Previously, when there is a restart on such a cluster, the cluster states were needed to be changed manually. For some cases, this might have led to data loss. Now, the shutdown process is automated.
