What is this PR for?\r\nIt would be nice if we could get PID of running interpreter, and group of paragraphs that running under that interpreter, using API and JMX.\r\n\r\nUsing this feature it will be easy to check CPU and memory load, etc. \r\nThis PR adds:\r\n* API method to get info about running interpreters (`/api/interpreter/running`)\r\n* API method to get info about running paragraphs grouped by interpreters (`/api/notebook/jobmanager/running`)\r\n* Few JMX methods which do the same as API.\r\n* Template for simple running paragraphs analysis using API.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR

What is this PR for?\r\n**New Java interpreter**\r\nThere are several Java libraries that could be used to leverage the Data Visualization & Collaboration features of Zeppelin hence the need of a Java interpreter to run any java code / library with no further dependencies.\r\nDependencies to any java library can be added by the end users in the Java Zeppelin interpreter Dependencies settings section.\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n* Feature\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* Any feedback from reviewers\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* [ZEPPELIN-3653]\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nManually\r\n* Start the Zeppelin server\r\n* Create a new note with the java interpreter binding\r\n* Write some java code as per documentation (docs/interpreter/java.md)\r\nUnit tests\r\n* Run unit tests (JavaInterpreterTest.java and JavaInterpreterUtilsTest.java)\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?\r\nNo, the dependency on com.thoughtworks.qdox was already added as part of the Beam Interpreter.\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?\r\nNo.\r\n* Does this needs documentation?\r\nYes, it has been added to the PR, see

What is this PR for?\r\nThis PR enables the interpolation of ZeppelinContext objects into the paragraph text of BigQuery cells. It also introduces a new interpreter-level configuration parameter named `zeppelin.bigquery.interpolation`. This new parameter is `false` by default, and must be set to `true` to enable object interpolation. The default value of `false` guarantees backward compatibility for users who are not aware of the new feature.\r\n\r\nThe implementation takes the same approach that was followed in PR [2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898) and [2903](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2903).\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[ Feature ]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3438\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nTwo new unit test classes have been added: [BigQueryInterpolationDisabled.java](https://github.com/sanjaydasgupta/zeppelin/blob/572c2aaa7a96eca98cdef4c77044dfc7a359f89f/bigquery/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/bigquery/BigQueryInterpolationDisabled.java), and [BigQueryInterpolationEnabled.java](https://github.com/sanjaydasgupta/zeppelin/blob/572c2aaa7a96eca98cdef4c77044dfc7a359f89f/bigquery/src/test/java/org/apache/zeppelin/bigquery/BigQueryInterpolationEnabled.java).\r\n\r\nAlso, the code in this PR merely causes the BigQuery interpreter to \"opt-in\" to the implementation of z-variable interpolation already existing in the Interpreter base class - described in [PR-2898](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/pull/2898). The unit tests necessary for testing z-variable interpolation in detail are already present in PR-2898\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?  No\r\n* Is there breaking changes for older versions?  No\r\n* Does this needs documentation?  Yes, documentation changes provided in

What is this PR for?\r\n> It's information in resourcePool, but it is only available for viewing. It would be nice if we can save this data to SQL via JDBC Driver.\r\n\r\nNow you can access to `ResourcePool` data from SQL query. For example, if you write `SELECT * FROM {ResourcePool.note_id=SOME_NOTE_ID.paragraph_id=SOME_PARAGRAPH_ID};` and it will be correct SQL query.\r\nHow it works:\r\n1. Creates and fills a table named like a `PARAGRAPH_ID`;\r\n2. Expression `{*}` replaces with actual table name;\r\n3. Updated SQL query is running.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can not specify the note_id, then the note_id of the current notebook will be used.

User can specify the paragraph level properties after the repl name (e.g. `%spark(pool=p1, imageWidth=200)`)\r\n\r\nThe jdbc interpreter is another example (like `%jdbc(hive)`, but we use other kind of hack method for that before. This PR also update jdbc interpreter to adopt the paragraph level properties. \r\n\r\nThis PR just allow user to specify paragraph level properties and pass them to interpreter. It is interpreter's responsibility to use these paragraph level properties. So there will be some follow up work to customize interpreter at paragraph level. E.g. allow spark interpreter to specify the queue for paragraph. \r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Feature]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n* [ ] - Task\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\n* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-3348\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\n* CI pass\r\n\r\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\r\n\r\n### Questions:\r\n* Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\r\nNotebooks of any size can be exported and saved, but the import facility only accepts notebooks up to 1Mb in size. Allowing notebooks bigger than 1Mb to be saved silently (without any warning or error notification) is therefore a dangerous trap for users.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that notebooks bigger than 1Mb are rare and unusual, but a saved notebook also contains the displayed output - and can contain large volumes of tabular data, and even images from matplotlib output. Large notebooks can be common when zeppelin is used for presentation of visual analysis.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a popup dialog which is displayed when the user attempts to export a notebook that has a size exceeding 1Mb. A screenshot of the popup is shown below.\r\n\r\n![popup-dialog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/477015/41522941-cb2c5c7c-72f5-11e8-83e6-b3f6f29ee834.png)\r\n\r\n### What type of PR is it?\r\n[Bug Fix]\r\n\r\n### Todos\r\n\r\n### What is the Jira issue?\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-2605\r\n\r\n### How should this be tested?\r\nCI pass\r\nManual testing.

So that each interpreter can specify its own timeout threshold without restarting the zeppelin server in case he hit the timeout issue. Besides that I change the default timeout to be 60 seconds. This is what zeppelin did before. Although the default timeout is 30 seconds before, but RemoteInterpreterManagedProcess will still wait for 2 times of timeout threshold.
