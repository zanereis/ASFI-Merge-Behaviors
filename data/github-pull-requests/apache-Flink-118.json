What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently, ExecNode#getOutputType always returns RowType. But some nodes do not return RowData, such as BatchExecSink and StreamExecSink. The output type of ExecNode should be consistent with the type parameter T. So ExecNode#getOutputType should return LogicalType instead of RowType, each subclass cast the LogicalType to specific type when using it.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Change ExecNode#getOutputType's return type from RowType to LogicalType*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a refactoring rework covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUnalignedCheckpointITCase may timeout because of some invalid assumptions and rare issues caused by overloading of the test machines.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nImproves UnalignedCheckpointITCase in the following ways to avoid running into rare issues or better deal with them:\r\n- Reduce load on test machine: Executing a test with p=10 may spawn up to 70 tasks that until backpressured can potentially lead to a full load on 70 cores. This may causes larger GC pauses and other JVM freezes that will trigger the rare PartitionNotFound exception. Now, sources are throttled until the sink backpressures.\r\n- Avoid relying completely on notifyCheckpointComplete to finish test: notifyCheckpointComplete is not guaranteed to be called but the test completely relied on it. This may lead to indefinite test runs: Some sources are finished while others are still running, but new checkpoints are canceled because of the finished sources. Thus, too many aborted checkpoints will also lead to a completed test.\r\n- Readding splits to enumerator (after FLINK-20290 has been fixed). Any unexpected failure may have caused all splits to be dropped, which causes indefinite running tests.\r\n- Removing test-class level timeout - AZP has its own timeout that also provides thread dumps - something that would require a tremendous effort in JUnit4.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nStabilizing test.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis adds a name-based field mode to the `Row` class. It simplifies the handling of large rows (possibly with hundreds of fields) and will make it easier to switch between DataStream API and Table API.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation of Row:\r\n\r\n```\r\n * <p>Fields of a row can be accessed either position-based or name-based. An implementer can decide\r\n * in which field mode a row should operate during creation. Rows that were produced by the framework\r\n * support a hybrid of both field modes (i.e. named positions):\r\n *\r\n * <h1>Position-based field mode</h1>\r\n *\r\n * <p>{@link Row#withPositions(int)} creates a fixed-length row. The fields can be accessed by position\r\n * (zero-based) using {@link #getField(int)} and {@link #setField(int, Object)}. Every field is initialized\r\n * with {@code null} by default.\r\n *\r\n * <h1>Name-based field mode</h1>\r\n *\r\n * <p>{@link Row#withNames()} creates a variable-length row. The fields can be accessed by name using\r\n * {@link #getField(String)} and {@link #setField(String, Object)}. Every field is initialized during\r\n * the first call to {@link #setField(String, Object)} for the given name. However, the framework will\r\n * initialize missing fields with {@code null} and reorder all fields once more type information is\r\n * available during serialization or input conversion. Thus, even name-based rows eventually become\r\n * fixed-length composite types with a deterministic field order.\r\n *\r\n * <h1>Hybrid / named-position field mode</h1>\r\n *\r\n * <p>Rows that were produced by the framework (after deserialization or output conversion) are fixed-length\r\n * rows with a deterministic field order that can map static field names to field positions. Thus, fields\r\n * can be accessed both via {@link #getField(int)} and {@link #getField(String)}. Both {@link #setField(int, Object)}\r\n * and {@link #setField(String, Object)} are supported for existing fields. However, adding new field\r\n * names via {@link #setField(String, Object)} is not allowed. A hybrid row's {@link #equals(Object)}\r\n * supports comparing to all kinds of rows. A hybrid row's {@link #hashCode()} is only valid for position-based\r\n * rows.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Update `Row`\r\n- Update `RowSerializer`\r\n- Update `RowRowConverter`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- `RowTest`\r\n- `RowSerializerTest`\r\n- `DataStructureConverterTest`\r\n- `RowFunctionTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: yes\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`native-k8s` command has been removed in https://github.com/apache/flink-docker/pull/49.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Currently, we introduce ExecGraphGenerator to translate a graph of FlinkPhysicalRel to a ExecNode graph. While as more and more ExecNode supported, ExecGraphGenerator is hard to maintain. So we introduce FlinkPhysicalRel#translateToExecNode to create specific ExecNode in each physical RelNode, and ExecGraphGenerator is used to build the whole graph based on the translated ExecNode, including connecting the input/output nodes, handling the rel visitor, handle some special nodes (such as, Exchange), etc.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Introduce translateToExecNode method for FlinkPhysicalRel*\r\n  - *ExecGraphGenerator does not create ExecNode any more*\r\n  - *add setInputNodes method for ExecNodeBase, which could help ExecGraphGenerator building ExecNode graph before ExecEdge supports `source`/`target`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a refactoring rework covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the error doc in

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixed JsonRowFormatFactory support for the format.ignore-parse-errors property, so that data that does not conform to the json specification can be automatically ignored.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add JsonValidator.FORMAT_IGNORE_PARSE_ERRORS property to the JsonRowFormatFactory#supportedFormatProperties method*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, the *JsonRowFormatFactoryTest*.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, users need to use a `collector` to collect the output of their ProcessFunction. We should use yield to make it more efficient that avoid using an array buffer to store the collected data, and it would be more pythonic as well.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Remove the Collector class*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has test cases covered by test_process_function() and test_timestamp_assigner_and_watermark_strategy() in test_data_stream.py\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nRemove the extra space placed between `-D` and param which caused dynamic parameters failed to be passed in \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- remove extra space for properties to be passed in\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFlink scala shell does not work with Scala 2.12. But it still provides start-scala-shell.sh in bin folder. Need to hide it in scala 2.12 edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Changed flink-dist module. Now maven will only copy start-scala-shell.sh file to bin folder only when scala-2.11 profile is activated.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n- Compile Flink with: `mvn clean package -Dscala-2.11`. Verify the file start-scala-shell.sh should exist in bin folder.\r\n- Compile Flink with: `mvn clean package -Dscala-2.12`. File start-scala-shell.sh should not exist in bin folder.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers:no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  -

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen consuming from `LATEST`, the `KinesisDataFetcher` converts the shard iterator type into an `AT_TIMESTAMP` to ensure all shards start from the same position. When `LATEST` is used each shared would effectively start from a different point in the time.\r\n\r\nDynamoDB streams do not support `AT_TIMESTAMP` iterator type and consuming from latest is broken\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Remove shard iterator type transform for DynamoDB streams consumer to fix consume from `LATEST`\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Added unit test: `DynamoDBStreamsDataFetcherTest`\r\n- Deployed application to local Flink cluster and verified consumer works as expected\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe Kinesis EFO connector invokes `DescribeStream` during startup to acquire the stream ARN. This call also includes the shard information and has a TPS of 10. A similar service exists, `DescribeStreamSummary` that has a TPS of 20 and a lighter response payload size.\r\n\r\nDuring startup sources with high parallelism compete to call this service (in `LAZY` mode), resulting in backoff and retry. Essentially the startup time can grow by 1s for every 10 parallelism, due to the 10 TPS. Migrating to `DescribeStreamSummary` will improve startup time.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Migrate call to `DescribeStream` to use `DescribeStreamSummary` \r\n- Updated Kinesis Connector documentation to reflect this change\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n- Migrated unit tests, all pass\r\n- Deployed application to Flink cluster locally and verified working \r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIf user manually cancels a job when the job is failing(here failing means the job encounters unrecoverable failure and is about to fail), the job will hang in CANCELING state and cannot terminate. The cause is that DefaultScheduler currently will always try to transition from `FAILING` to `FAILED` to terminate the job. However, job canceling will change job status to `CANCELING` so that the transition to `FAILED` will not success. This PR is to fix this problem.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExecutionGraphRestartTest is reworked to be based on the new scheduler to verify it.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (**yes** / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

I61f5dd108eeb63ca243deeebaa197ef7f99111a2\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nImprove file system option description\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nCurrently, when users declare a TypeInfo in Python DataStream job it will create a Java TypeInfo instance when instantiating. We should make it in a lazy style that creates the Java TypeInfo instance only when calling TypeInformation.get_java_type_info().\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Removed WrapperTypeInfo*\r\n- *No need to create Java TypeInfo in Python TypeInfo constructor*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change has test case covered by all existing IT cases.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nTry to avoid the exception that log4j.properties and logback.xml are set wrongly when illegal mode or no mode is specified when running Flink Scala shell using start-scala-shell.sh\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added an additional if-else branch to set the default log4j.properties and logback.xml when  illegal mode or no mode is provided.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Travis CI to do that following [this guide](https://flink.apache.org/contributing/contribute-code.html#open-a-pull-request).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd compression support for ParquetAvroWriters.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Added overloaded versions for methods 'forSpecificRecord', 'forGenericRecord' and 'forReflectRecord', which need an extra CompressionCodecName parameter.\r\n  - Added corresponding unit tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Added extra unit test cases locates in ParquetStreamingFileSinkITCase, with methods named `testWriteParquetAvroSpecificWithCompression`, `testWriteParquetAvroGenericWithCompression` and `testWriteParquetAvroReflectWithCompression`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?  JavaDocs\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-16T03:18:53Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T03:39:29Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1274303759,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc0MzAzNzU5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Formats","name":"component=Formats","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":8006043121,"node_id":"LA_kwDOATokT88AAAAB3TKF8Q","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"D93F0B","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14395/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14395/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14395/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/966c45118322ce5b9610f5e898843d3997e41357","head":{"label":"paul8263:FLINK-16491","ref":"FLINK-16491","sha":"966c45118322ce5b9610f5e898843d3997e41357","user":{"login":"paul8263","id":7007327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDczMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7007327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263","html_url":"https://github.com/paul8263","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":321848988,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjE4NDg5ODg=","name":"flink","full_name":"paul8263/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"paul8263","id":7007327,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwMDczMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7007327?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263","html_url":"https://github.com/paul8263","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paul8263/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/paul8263/flink","description":"Apache

skip the processing of slot allocation that have already concluded by no longer relying on the cancellation of futures, as it is unreliable when using async operations since other operations may occur in-between, and instead using a set for tracking pending allocations and checking at the start of processing.\r\n\r\nBasically, in the current code the future to be cancelled can be completed without the async portion having run but being scheduled. If now some operation occurs that would lead to the future being cancelled, then the async portion still runs because a completed future cannot be cancelled.\r\n\r\nThis wasn't a problem in the old slot manager because it was a lot more lenient when it comes to changing slot states.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-15T16:57:37Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T22:01:10Z","closed_at":"2020-12-17T15:17:04Z","merged_at":"2020-12-17T15:17:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"5cabecb0f7b7ad25036badca40500782eacef848","assignee":{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"tillrohrmann","id":5756858,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NTY4NTg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5756858?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann","html_url":"https://github.com/tillrohrmann","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tillrohrmann/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994322,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MzIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Coordination","name":"component=Runtime/Coordination","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14393/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14393/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14393/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/0d433649f8b04bb456aeaf28fd13dfa82cbea936","head":{"label":"zentol:20605","ref":"20605","sha":"0d433649f8b04bb456aeaf28fd13dfa82cbea936","user":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20647396,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0NzM5Ng==","name":"flink","full_name":"zentol/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zentol","id":5725237,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MjUyMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5725237?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol","html_url":"https://github.com/zentol","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zentol/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.git

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nfix sql cli with hive catalog behaves right when create a function using jar specified by -j option\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- In CatalogFunctionImpl#isGeneric(), use thread context classloader to load class\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *build a new flink dist and start the cluster*\r\n  - *modify sql-client-defaults.yaml to add a hive catalog*\r\n  - *start sql cli with a -j point to user jar file*\r\n  - *use hive catalog and create a function using the udf class from user jar*\r\n  - *create successfully*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-15T15:50:50Z","updated_at":"2021-05-28T06:58:37Z","closed_at":"2020-12-30T09:25:54Z","merged_at":"2020-12-30T09:25:54Z","merge_commit_sha":"f17562e78526eb27398ab9699e8e4fb60501cc99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1333559280,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMzNTU5Mjgw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Client","name":"component=TableSQL/Client","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14392/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14392/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14392/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/a366565d2ef37c57eee2d17f5718b2f0e6f173a8","head":{"label":"AkisAya:FLINK-20606","ref":"FLINK-20606","sha":"a366565d2ef37c57eee2d17f5718b2f0e6f173a8","user":{"login":"AkisAya","id":15843126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya","html_url":"https://github.com/AkisAya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":194652510,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTQ2NTI1MTA=","name":"flink","full_name":"AkisAya/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"AkisAya","id":15843126,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1ODQzMTI2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15843126?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya","html_url":"https://github.com/AkisAya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AkisAya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/AkisAya/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis pull request fixes an error of multiple input types in udfs page.\r\nDemonstration error of multiple input types in FunctionHint: \r\n```\r\n@FunctionHint(\r\n  input = [@DataTypeHint(\"INT\"), @DataTypeHint(\"INT\")],\r\n  output = @DataTypeHint(\"INT\")\r\n)\r\n```\r\nshould be \r\n```\r\n@FunctionHint(\r\n  input = {@DataTypeHint(\"INT\"), @DataTypeHint(\"INT\")},\r\n  output = @DataTypeHint(\"INT\")\r\n)\r\n```\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  -  Fix an error in `flink/flink/docs/dev/table/functions/udfs.md` and `flink/flink/docs/dev/table/functions/udfs.zh.md`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-15T09:59:13Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T18:18:42Z","closed_at":"2020-12-17T12:16:34Z","merged_at":"2020-12-17T12:16:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"ec2bc631423febc5f9cde6f3d82336b2ee3e9a7f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1289893384,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg5ODkzMzg0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/API","name":"component=TableSQL/API","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14388/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14388/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14388/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/e88b034759b082dbd67aeb98da0a2685e057902d","head":{"label":"shizhengchao:FLINK-20607","ref":"FLINK-20607","sha":"e88b034759b082dbd67aeb98da0a2685e057902d","user":{"login":"shizhengchao","id":22866465,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyODY2NDY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22866465?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao","html_url":"https://github.com/shizhengchao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shizhengchao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5088b8acc5a28f1462ac185e21b286140da9b9f4","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nExpose `CONNECTION_CHECK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` as a configurable option in Jdbc connector\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-15T09:02:32Z","updated_at":"2022-03-17T18:18:43Z","closed_at":"2020-12-25T02:15:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1c32b05059baf1f5b710d8455d0531236a029b5e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1278775149,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjc4Nzc1MTQ5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/JDBC","name":"component=Connectors/JDBC","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1292353221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkyMzUzMjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","name":"component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14387/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14387/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14387/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/41ce4490c91979e9ec1e28f975439c29e545e48a","head":{"label":"xiaoHoly:pr_jdbcOption_holy","ref":"pr_jdbcOption_holy","sha":"41ce4490c91979e9ec1e28f975439c29e545e48a","user":{"login":"xiaoHoly","id":37236383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM2Mzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37236383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoHoly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":305929363,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDU5MjkzNjM=","name":"flink","full_name":"xiaoHoly/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xiaoHoly","id":37236383,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MjM2Mzgz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37236383?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly","html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoHoly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xiaoHoly/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xiaoHoly/flink","description":"Apache

Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSupport hive built-in functions for versions prior to 1.2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Use `FunctionInfo::isNative` to decide whether a function is built-in for hive version < 1.2.0\r\n  - Update shim classes\r\n  - Update hive module tests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nUpdated test cases\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis PR completes the envisioned design of FLIP-32 and FLIP-65. It makes implementing built-in\r\nfunctions as easy as implementing user-defined functions while keeping function definition and body (aka runtime\r\nimplementation) separately.\r\n\r\nIt introduces the concept of `SpecializedFunctions` to hook into the planning phase for generating\r\nruntime implementation lazily.\r\n\r\nFor proving the concepts, the PR implements two frequently requested functions: `TYPEOF()` and `IFNULL()`\r\n\r\nWith this PR, adding a built-in function requires changes in only 2 classes: `BuiltInFunctionDefinitions` for the definition and the class that contains the actual runtime logic.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nSee commit messages.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n- `FunctionITCase`\r\n- `MiscFunctionsITCase`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is

To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe Jdbc-connector's 'lookup.max-retries' option implementation is different from the meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nProtobuf is a structured data format introduced by google. Compared to json, protobuf is more efficient of space and computing. Nowadays, many companies use protobuf instead of json as data format in kafka and streaming processing.\r\n\r\nSo, we will introduce a new format which can derialize/serialize protobuf data in a fast speed.\r\nUser can use this format in SQL or Table API. \r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table source(\r\n....... column list\r\n) \r\n                with(\r\n                'connector' = 'kafka',\r\n                'format' = 'protobuf',\r\n                'protobuf.message-class-name' = '<message class name>'\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreate table sink(\r\n....... column list\r\n) \r\nwith(\r\n                'connector' = 'kafka',\r\n                'format' = 'protobuf',\r\n                'protobuf.message-class-name' = '<message class name>'\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nPbRowDeserializationSchema deserializationSchema = new PbRowDeserializationSchema(\r\n\t\t\trowType, //RowType of schema\r\n\t\t\tInternalTypeInfo.of(rowType), //TypeInformation<RowData> of schema\r\n\t\t\tSimpleProtoTest.class.getName(), //message class name\r\n\t\t\tfalse, // ignoreParseErrors\r\n\t\t\tfalse // readDefaultValues\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\tPbRowSerializationSchema serializationSchema = new PbRowSerializationSchema(\r\n\t\t\trowType, //RowType  of schema\r\n\t\t\tSimpleProtoTest.class.getName() //message class name\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\nAdd many unit tests to test of des/ser for different data type/structures of protobuf.\r\n\r\n## Benchmark\r\nPerformance test for pb object containing 200+ fields. Below is the consumed time of processing 10M rows.\r\nImplementation | Deserialize Speed | Serialize Speed\r\n-- | -- | --\r\njson | 110s | 120s\r\nDynamicMessage and Descriptor API | 152s | 206s\r\nCodegen(this PR) | 42s | 33s\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - New dependencies: Add protobuf dependency com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:3.12.2\r\n  - Public API: Add new format in Flink SQL\r\n  - The serializers: Add new PbRowDeserializationSchema and PbRowSerializationSchema\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): yes\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nConnector params:\r\n\r\n1. protobuf.message-class-name: Required option to specify the full name of protobuf message class. The protobuf class \r\nmust be located in the classpath both in client and task side.\r\n1. protobuf.read-default-values: Optional flag to read as default values instead of null when some field does not exist in deserialization; default to false. If proto syntax is proto3, this value will be set true forcibly because proto3's standard is to use default values.\r\n1. protobuf.ignore-parse-errors: Optional flag to skip rows with parse errors instead of failing; false by default..\r\n1. protobuf.write-null-string-literal: When serializing to protobuf data, this is the optional config to specify the string literal in protobuf's array/map in case of null values. By default empty string is used.\r\n\r\n## Notice\r\n\r\n### default values\r\nAs you know, if the protobuf syntax is proto2, the generated pb class has validity bit flags to indicate whether a field is set or not. We can use `pbObject.hasXXX()` method to know whether the field is set or not. So if syntax=2，the decoded flink row may contain null values. User can also set `protobuf.read-default-values` to control the behavior of handling null values.\r\nBut if the syntax is proto3, the generated protobuf class does not have `pbObject.hasXXX()` method and does not hold validity bit flags, so there is no way to tell if a field is set or not if it is equals to default value. For example, if `pbObj.getDim1()` returns 0, there's no way to tell if dim1 is set by 0 or it is not set anyway. So if message class is from proto3 syntax, the decoded flink row will not contain any null values.\r\n \r\nAlso pb does not permit null in key/value of map and array. We need to generate default value for them.\r\n\r\nrow value | pb value\r\n-- | --\r\nmap<string,string>(<\"a\", null>) | map<string,string>((\"a\", \"\"))\r\nmap<string,string>(<null, \"a\">) | map<string,string>((\"\", \"a\"))\r\nmap<int, int>(null, 1) | map<int, int>(0, 1)\r\nmap<int, int>(1, null) | map<int, int>(1, 0)\r\nmap<long, long>(null, 1) | map<long, long>(0, 1)\r\nmap<long, long>(1, null) | map<long, long>(1, 0)\r\nmap<bool, bool>(null, true) | map<bool, bool>(false, true)\r\nmap<bool, bool>(true, null) | map<bool, bool>(true, false)\r\nmap<string, float>(\"key\", null) | map<string, float>(\"key\", 0)\r\nmap<string, double>(\"key\", null) | map<string, double>(\"key\", 0)\r\nmap<string, enum>(\"key\", null) | map<string, enum>(\"key\", first_enum_element)\r\nmap<string, binary>(\"key\", null) | map<string, binary>(\"key\", ByteString.EMPTY)\r\nmap<string, MESSAGE>(\"key\", null) | map<string, MESSAGE>(\"key\", MESSAGE.getDefaultInstance())\r\narray<:string>(null) | array(\"\")\r\narray<:int >(null) | array(0)\r\narray<:long>(null) | array(0)\r\narray<:bool>(null) | array(false)\r\narray<:float>(null) | array(0)\r\narray<:double>(null) | array(0)\r\narray<:enum>(null) | array(first_enum_element)\r\narray<:binary>(null) | array(ByteString.EMPTY)\r\narray<:message>(null) | array(MESSAGE.getDefaultInstance())\r\n\r\n### OneOf field\r\nIn serialization process, there's no guarantee that the flink row fields of one-of group only contains at least one non-null value.\r\nSo in serialization, we set each field in the order of flink schema, so the field in high position will override then field of low position in the same one-of group.\r\n\r\n### Enum type\r\nEnum value of

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe Kinesis producer is loading some classes which register static final instance fields. These fields prevent the user code classloader from unloading, leading to pollution of the JVM Metaspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nI manually verified the behavior by monitoring the metaspace of a TaskManager. The initial spikes are caused by a Kinesis Producer implementation with the new changes applied (= using the classloader shutdown hook). Later, the TM gets killed by running out of JVM metaspace, when running the old Kinesis Producer implementation.\r\n<img width=\"606\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-12-12 at 12 27 30\"

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\nFix the `NOTE` tip style in process_function page:\r\nin `/docs/stream/operators/process_function.md`, line 252.  The `NOTE` css style is different from the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n1.

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Add PyFlink job submission section under the Advanced CLI section.*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- *Added a new section named \"Submitting PyFlink Jobs\" under Advanced CLI section*\r\n- *Corrected the reference links in datastream_tutorial.md and table_api_tutorial.md*\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44767915/101876361-3fcf1a00-3bc7-11eb-8966-b28bb2acdd39.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-11T07:41:15Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T02:57:09Z","closed_at":"2020-12-17T02:57:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"96f738b482f99eeb8480e181dfacefe90e7e9bdc","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273030665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMDMwNjY1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=API/Python","name":"component=API/Python","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14367/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14367/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14367/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d1f984ee907996303c30a9fba85ee177cc688855","head":{"label":"shuiqiangchen:FLINK-20352","ref":"FLINK-20352","sha":"d1f984ee907996303c30a9fba85ee177cc688855","user":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":157520857,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNTc1MjA4NTc=","name":"flink","full_name":"shuiqiangchen/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"shuiqiangchen","id":44767915,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0NzY3OTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44767915?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen","html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/shuiqiangchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/shuiqiangchen/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the

via JDBC\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n*Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Refactor verifyPlan method in TableTestBase as following:\r\n1. replace planBefore with ast in xml file. ast is \"Abstract Syntax Tree\", corresponding to \"Abstract Syntax Tree\" item in the explain result;\r\n2. remove planAfter, introduce optimized rel plan and optimized exec plan. optimized rel plan is the optimized rel plan, and is similar to \"Optimized Physical Plan\" item in the explain result. but different from \"Optimized Physical Plan\", optimized rel plan can represent either optimized logical rel plan (for rule testing) or optimized physical rel plan (for changelog validation, etc). optimized exec plan is the optimized execution plan, corresponding to \"Optimized Execution Plan\" item in the explain result. see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-20478 for more details about explain refactor\r\n3. keep verifyPlan method, which will print ast, optimized rel plan and optimized exec plan.\r\n4. add verifyRelPlan method, which will print ast, optimized rel plan\r\n5. add verifyExecPlan method, which will print ast and optimized exec plan.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Refactor verifyPlan method and update the related tests*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe AkkaRpcActor failed at sending asynchronous null responses because\r\nit did not wrap the null value in a Status.Success message for local messages.\r\nFor remote messages it ran into a NPE because it did not check the\r\nSerializedValue.getByteArray(). This commit fixes both problems so that Flink's\r\nRPC service now supports to respond with null values.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded `RemoteAkkaRpcActorTest` and `AkkaRpcActorTest.canRespondWithNullValueLocally` and `AkkaRpcActorTest.canRespondWithSynchronousNullValueLocally`.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nAdd documentation for `records-lag-max` metric.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix typo in [Cassandra Connector](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/dev/connectors/cassandra.html) docs. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix typo in [EXPLAIN Statements](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.12/dev/table/sql/explain.html) docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*Fix config 'state.savepoint.dir' into 'state.savepoints.dir' in docs*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Fix wrong config in `savepoints.zh.md`*\r\n  - *Fix wrong config in `flink-operations-playground.md`*\r\n  - *Fix wrong config in `flink-operations-playground.zh.md`*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a doc fix without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (not applicable)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-09T13:39:49Z","updated_at":"2020-12-10T05:49:43Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T14:38:43Z","merged_at":"2020-12-09T14:38:43Z","merge_commit_sha":"15837144ea416b0f71c917e581b2dac884922e42","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1272994186,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjcyOTk0MTg2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Documentation","name":"component=Documentation","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14349/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14349/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14349/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/6d485a7908b0ccc977a40ece426663277f5abf1a","head":{"label":"fornaix:savepoint_docs_fix","ref":"savepoint_docs_fix","sha":"6d485a7908b0ccc977a40ece426663277f5abf1a","user":{"login":"fornaix","id":20068214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDY4MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20068214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix","html_url":"https://github.com/fornaix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":319961669,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMTk5NjE2Njk=","name":"flink","full_name":"fornaix/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fornaix","id":20068214,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMDY4MjE0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20068214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix","html_url":"https://github.com/fornaix","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fornaix/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fornaix/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nUnalignedCheckpointITCase may timeout because of some invalid assumptions and rare issues caused by overloading of the test machines.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nImproves UnalignedCheckpointITCase in the following ways to avoid running into rare issues or better deal with them:\r\n- Reduce load on test machine: Executing a test with p=10 may spawn up to 70 tasks that until backpressured can potentially lead to a full load on 70 cores. This may causes larger GC pauses and other JVM freezes that will trigger the rare PartitionNotFound exception. Now, sources are throttled until the sink backpressures.\r\n- Keep track of restart attempts in split enumerator and sink with source instances. Only finish sources if the desired numbers of failures occurred to avoid finishing too quickly.\r\n- Avoid relying completely on notifyCheckpointComplete to finish test: notifyCheckpointComplete is not guaranteed to be called but the test completely relied on it. This may lead to indefinite test runs: Some sources are finished while others are still running, but new checkpoints are canceled because of the finished sources. Thus, too many aborted checkpoints will also lead to a completed test.\r\n- Readding splits to enumerator (after FLINK-20290 has been fixed). Any unexpected failure may have caused all splits to be dropped, which causes indefinite running tests.\r\n- Removing test-class level timeout - AZP has its own timeout that also provides thread dumps - something that would require a tremendous effort in JUnit4.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nStabilizing test.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (**not applicable** / docs / JavaDocs / not documented)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-09T13:36:03Z","updated_at":"2020-12-17T20:26:28Z","closed_at":"2020-12-17T20:26:24Z","merged_at":"2020-12-17T20:26:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"d07140c7a2dfe33a067454a7a802e25e81c0d168","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273376312,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzc2MzEy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/Checkpointing","name":"component=Runtime/Checkpointing","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14348/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14348/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14348/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/d13d56cb93c745ca2af5b7f5ef72a27027af43f1","head":{"label":"AHeise:FLINK-20433","ref":"FLINK-20433","sha":"d13d56cb93c745ca2af5b7f5ef72a27027af43f1","user":{"login":"AHeise","id":4559103,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTkxMDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4559103?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise","html_url":"https://github.com/AHeise","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AHeise/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"5cabecb0f7b7ad25036badca40500782eacef848","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":20587599,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDU4NzU5OQ==","name":"flink","full_name":"apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe e2e test `SQL Client end-to-end test (Old planner) Elasticsearch (v7.5.1)` runs fail on arm64. This patch fixed the failure.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n* Add Elasticsearch 7.x arm64 package download link\r\n* Make `xpack.ml.enabled: false` config option only works in Elasticsearch 6.X\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis is a test code change only for arm64. and it has been tested in openlab arm64 CI\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*(For example: This pull request makes task deployment go through the blob server, rather than through RPC. That way we avoid re-transferring them on each deployment (during recovery).)*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix typo in upsert kafka docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *The TaskInfo is stored in the blob store on job creation time as a persistent artifact*\r\n  - *Deployments RPC transmits only the blob storage reference*\r\n  - *TaskManagers retrieve the TaskInfo from the blob cache*\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n*(example:)*\r\n  - *Added integration tests for end-to-end deployment with large payloads (100MB)*\r\n  - *Extended integration test for recovery after master (JobManager) failure*\r\n  - *Added test that validates that TaskInfo is transferred only once across recoveries*\r\n  - *Manually verified the change by running a 4 node cluser with 2 JobManagers and 4 TaskManagers, a stateful streaming program, and killing one JobManager and two TaskManagers during the execution, verifying that recovery happens correctly.*\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / no)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / no / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / no)\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nConfigure partitioned index and filters options according to 'https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Partitioned-Index-Filters'.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n  - Add `state.backend.rocksdb.memory.partitioned-index-filters` option represent enable this feature\r\n  - Add `state.backend.rocksdb.block.metadata-blocksize` config can set partitioned index block size\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Add test `testGetColumnFamilyOptionsWithPartitionedIndex` in `RocksDBResourceContainerTest`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): ( no)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: ( no)\r\n  - The serializers: (no)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (no)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (no)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (no)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes )\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? (docs)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T19:01:12Z","updated_at":"2021-03-22T12:19:21Z","closed_at":"2021-03-04T04:30:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2ef512cd8833516a4f869c552e9cc324f430ab9b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273319732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMzE5NzMy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Runtime/StateBackends","name":"component=Runtime/StateBackends","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14341/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14341/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14341/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/604cc59c9b3c73826307be63896d35264997aefd","head":{"label":"liuyufei9527:FLINK-20496","ref":"FLINK-20496","sha":"604cc59c9b3c73826307be63896d35264997aefd","user":{"login":"liuyufei9527","id":51392299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzkyMjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51392299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyufei9527","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":197696713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTc2OTY3MTM=","name":"flink","full_name":"liuyufei9527/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liuyufei9527","id":51392299,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzkyMjk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51392299?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527","html_url":"https://github.com/liuyufei9527","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liuyufei9527/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liuyufei9527/flink","description":"Apache

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nFix the failure to generate plan for dynamic partition with order by.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Skip partition grouping in `BatchExecSinkRule` if input already defines a collation.\r\n  - Add test to verify the plan in `TableSinkTest`\r\n  - Add hive IT case\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nAdded test cases\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? no\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T13:26:18Z","updated_at":"2020-12-09T06:37:03Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T04:28:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"83ebfe75c59cddf6d3873484594ff6a5e89ae2ca","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1285080206,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjg1MDgwMjA2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Planner","name":"component=TableSQL/Planner","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14339/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14339/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14339/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/160b650c09a6ee33785349a5a8ed9df278cf8f61","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-20419-1.12","ref":"FLINK-20419-1.12","sha":"160b650c09a6ee33785349a5a8ed9df278cf8f61","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSome hive UDFs expect the type of string literal arguments to be `STRING`, while flink may consider them as `CHAR` which causes problems for such UDFs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Change the type of string literal argument to `STRING` for hive functions\r\n  - Add tests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting and added tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? NA\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T13:19:19Z","updated_at":"2021-01-28T08:34:24Z","closed_at":"2021-01-28T08:33:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"856c53c2ab230c6d980cf6c9f226888dd3850d56","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14338/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14338/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14338/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/872de3bf88035b995f466b2051d22416782c697e","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-20537-1.11","ref":"FLINK-20537-1.11","sha":"872de3bf88035b995f466b2051d22416782c697e","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nSome hive UDFs expect the type of string literal arguments to be `STRING`, while flink may consider them as `CHAR` which causes problems for such UDFs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Change the type of string literal argument to `STRING` for hive functions\r\n  - Add tests\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nExisting and added tests\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: no\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? no\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented? NA\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T12:39:22Z","updated_at":"2021-01-28T08:34:29Z","closed_at":"2021-01-28T08:33:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1edb924e961f6e6fd4380d1f321d6b18ccadc0c0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273410146,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczNDEwMTQ2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Hive","name":"component=Connectors/Hive","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14336/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14336/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14336/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/343aaeeb4a0a4b05f2c7797abf4ca3e9913a9ea0","head":{"label":"lirui-apache:FLINK-20537","ref":"FLINK-20537","sha":"343aaeeb4a0a4b05f2c7797abf4ca3e9913a9ea0","user":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":65453317,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NTQ1MzMxNw==","name":"flink","full_name":"lirui-apache/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"lirui-apache","id":5210788,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyMTA3ODg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5210788?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache","html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lirui-apache/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/lirui-apache/flink","description":"Mirror

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*In the origin test, it has 2 parallelisms and source will emit records to two producer threads. However, Kafka `DefaultPartitioner` hash strategy is slightly different from Flink `KeyGroupStreamPartitioner`, which causes the records in the different Flink partitions may be written into the same Kafka partition.  In the case above,  the Kafka partition is out-of-order and some records are late. This is the reason why we have the unstable test.* \r\n\r\n*Here we just reset the parallelism to 1 to fix the test.

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n*`FatalExitExceptionHandler` and `JvmShutdownSafeguard` use the same exit code (-17), making it impossible to distinguish the cause of an unexpected Flink JVM exit based on the exit code alone.  Enum `ExitCode` should be introduced that defines all possible exit codes in Flink. The exit codes are different for `FatalExitExceptionHandler` and `JvmShutdownSafeguard`.*\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - *Add `ExitCode` enum to indicate the associated process exit code.*\r\n  - *Change the exit code in `FatalExitExceptionHandler` to be different from `JvmShutdownSafeguard`.*\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature?

you very much for contributing to Apache Flink - we are happy that you want to help us improve Flink. To help the community review your contribution in the best possible way, please go through the checklist below, which will get the contribution into a shape in which it can be best reviewed.*\r\n\r\n*Please understand that we do not do this to make contributions to Flink a hassle. In order to uphold a high standard of quality for code contributions, while at the same time managing a large number of contributions, we need contributors to prepare the contributions well, and give reviewers enough contextual information for the review. Please also understand that contributions that do not follow this guide will take longer to review and thus typically be picked up with lower priority by the community.*\r\n\r\n## Contribution Checklist\r\n\r\n  - Make sure that the pull request corresponds to a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/issues). Exceptions are made for typos in JavaDoc or documentation files, which need no JIRA issue.\r\n  \r\n  - Name the pull request in the form \"[FLINK-XXXX] [component] Title of the pull request\", where *FLINK-XXXX* should be replaced by the actual issue number. Skip *component* if you are unsure about which is the best component.\r\n  Typo fixes that have no associated JIRA issue should be named following this pattern: `[hotfix] [docs] Fix typo in event time introduction` or `[hotfix] [javadocs] Expand JavaDoc for PuncuatedWatermarkGenerator`.\r\n\r\n  - Fill out the template below to describe the changes contributed by the pull request. That will give reviewers the context they need to do the review.\r\n  \r\n  - Make sure that the change passes the automated tests, i.e., `mvn clean verify` passes. You can set up Azure Pipelines CI to do that following [this guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/Azure+Pipelines#AzurePipelines-Tutorial:SettingupAzurePipelinesforaforkoftheFlinkrepository).\r\n\r\n  - Each pull request should address only one issue, not mix up code from multiple issues.\r\n  \r\n  - Each commit in the pull request has a meaningful commit message (including the JIRA id)\r\n\r\n  - Once all items of the checklist are addressed, remove the above text and this checklist, leaving only the filled out template below.\r\n\r\n\r\n**(The sections below can be removed for hotfixes of typos)**\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nIn the origin test, it has 2 parallelisms and source will emit records to two producer threads. However, Kafka `DefaultPartitioner` hash strategy is slightly different from Flink `KeyGroupStreamPartitioner`, which causes the records in the different Flink partitions may be written into the same Kafka partition.  In the case above,  the Kafka partition is out-of-order and some records are late. This is the reason why we have the unstable test. \r\n\r\nHere we just reset the parallelism to 1 to fix the test.  If users has the same problem, he/she can adjust the watermark strategy to tolerate the disorderness\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: (yes / **no**)\r\n  - The serializers: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: (yes / **no** / don't know)\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? (yes / **no**)\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-08T08:35:10Z","updated_at":"2021-03-17T12:02:30Z","closed_at":"2020-12-09T04:25:33Z","merged_at":"2020-12-09T04:25:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"b82585fb78309f45f421d932ad0b43ebf62150ea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1244454690,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjQ0NDU0Njkw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/review=description?","name":"review=description?","color":"bcf5db","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1273182709,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjczMTgyNzA5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=Connectors/Kafka","name":"component=Connectors/Kafka","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1292353221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjkyMzUzMjIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/labels/component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","name":"component=TableSQL/Ecosystem","color":"175fb7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14330/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/14330/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/issues/14330/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/flink/statuses/257dadab1e63c1b4b81df20825df6c1db60ba685","head":{"label":"fsk119:FLINK-20500","ref":"FLINK-20500","sha":"257dadab1e63c1b4b81df20825df6c1db60ba685","user":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":270591305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNzA1OTEzMDU=","name":"flink","full_name":"fsk119/flink","private":false,"owner":{"login":"fsk119","id":33114724,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMTE0NzI0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33114724?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119","html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fsk119/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/fsk119/flink","description":"Apache

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThis updates the `LookupTableSource` interface to the new type system.\r\n\r\n```\r\n * <p>By default, input and output data types are automatically extracted using reflection. This includes\r\n * the generic argument {@code T} of the class for determining an output data type. Input arguments are\r\n * derived from one or more {@code eval()} methods. If the reflective information is not sufficient, it\r\n * can be supported and enriched with {@link DataTypeHint} and {@link FunctionHint} annotations. See\r\n * {@link TableFunction} for more examples how to annotate an implementation class.\r\n *\r\n * <p>Note: Currently, asynchronous table functions are only supported as the runtime implementation\r\n * of {@link LookupTableSource}s for performing temporal joins. By default, input and output {@link DataType}s\r\n * of {@link AsyncTableFunction} are derived similar to other {@link UserDefinedFunction}s using the\r\n * logic above. However, for convenience, in a {@link LookupTableSource} the output type can simply be\r\n * a {@link Row} or {@link RowData} in which case the input and output types are derived from the\r\n * table's schema with default conversion.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nIt updates the code base to use a unified extraction logic for all kinds of functions.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nThis change is already covered by existing tests, such as `LookupJoinITCase` and `AsyncLookupJoinITCase`.\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows: `FunctionITCase.testLookupTableFunction`\r\n\r\n## Does this pull request potentially affect one of the following parts:\r\n\r\n  - Dependencies (does it add or upgrade a dependency): no\r\n  - The public API, i.e., is any changed class annotated with `@Public(Evolving)`: yes\r\n  - The serializers: no\r\n  - The runtime per-record code paths (performance sensitive): no\r\n  - Anything that affects deployment or recovery: JobManager (and its components), Checkpointing, Kubernetes/Yarn/Mesos, ZooKeeper: no\r\n  - The S3 file system connector: no\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n  - Does this pull request introduce a new feature? yes\r\n  - If yes, how is the feature documented?
