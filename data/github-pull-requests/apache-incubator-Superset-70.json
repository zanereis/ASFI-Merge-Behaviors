SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nSuperset can't smoothly switch between visualizations and can not safe switching. When you change visualizations, all your work on Explore is about to be lost. For example, there are 3 metrics on the `line chart`, then switching to the `big number`, the `3 metrics` will be lost, after then switching back to the `line chart`, the `3 metrics` was also gone.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a simple data structure to maintain different viz switching and save switching history. The new data structure is called `Standardized Form Data`.  The SFD will auto-mapping _form_data_ when triggered viz changing action. Each `controlPanel` in plugins provided `denormalizeFormData` function. The function supports a manual mapping approach when plugins have to map some control from `Standardized Form Data`.\r\n\r\nNote that the `Standardized Form Data` is intentionally designed not to persist, but to be hidden in the client's browser memory. In the other words, if the user closes the browser or refreshes the page, the viz changing history state will lose.\r\n\r\nThis PR has supported\r\n- Table\r\n- Pivot Table v2\r\n- Pie\r\n- Big Number Total\r\n- Big Number with Trendline\r\n- Line Chart v2 (Echart)\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/08016e60cc594578b105ec1ab9847b4a?sharedAppSource=personal_library\r\n\r\n#### After\r\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/603dccc033d6496d9399811180842a16?sharedAppSource=personal_library\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds a browser confirmation modal (similar to the one that we have in dashboard edit mode) when user makes a change in control panel and then tries to close Explore (either by closing the tab or moving to another page) without clicking Save button.\r\nCurrently, that modal is not customizable. However, when we implement Single Page Application in Superset, we'll probably be able to customize the modal when navigating within Superset.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<img width=\"1792\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/167422541-da6709f4-605b-4740-8cb5-80f693b956ea.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nChanges made without saving:\r\n1. Open a chart\r\n2. Make some changes in control panel\r\n3. Try to leave the page (close tab or navigate to another page)\r\n4.

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSave which tabs are selected in permalink state and restore the tab selection so we can restore the same tab selection when users open a dashboard using permalink.\r\n\r\nAlso renamed properties in the dashboard permalink state to make them easier to understand.\r\n\r\nThis is in preparation for https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19354 where we allow users to set tab selection when generating email reports for dashboards. The next step is to generate dashboard screenshots from permalink as well and attach the permalink to the email reports (we will generate a new permalink in the backend based on reports metadata). The next next step is to allow saving filter states in dashboard reports, too.\r\n\r\nDepends on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/19966\r\n\r\nThis PR includes a db migration where we renamed a couple of properties in permalink states. The migration should be fairly low risk since we are only updating permalinks for dashboards. At Airbnb, after running Superset with the new permalink feature for 3 weeks, there are only about 1400 links generated.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Go to a tabbed dashboard with multiple tabbed sections\r\n2. Switch more than one tab sections and copy a permalink for some tab\r\n3. When opening the permalink, the previous tab selection should be retained\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if

SUMMARY\r\nWith SIP68 we will be deprecating the ConnectorRegistry and instead having a fixed set of datasources. We currently pass both a dataset_id and datasource_type in the form_data, but we are only passing in the dataset_id to the api itself. In cases where there is no form data, we usually default to a \"table\" datasource, but this PR allows us to be more flexible about having different types of datasources in the future and changes the api to pass in both the datasource_type and id. We are introducing the intent to start using more datasources in [SIP81.](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/19953)\r\n\r\nThe goal with the cache keys and temporary explore state is to be able to read from the existing format (dataset_id) but write to the new format (datasource_id and datasource_type). Any existing keys in the old format would default to a type of 'table'.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo visual changes\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nExisting tests have been updated and a few new tests added to account for existing form_data cache structure. \r\nTo test, you should be able to go through the entire explore flow without any issues. \r\n\r\n###

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThe select all functionality was removed previously, but our users rely on this useful feature in the chart explorer, so this PR is for bringing back that feature. \r\n\r\nWith the way things currently are, the user must manually select columns one by one by clicking or dragging and dropping into the columns field when building a query in the explore view.  When the user is initially creating a chart, it is often the case that they want to query all the possible fields to identify what is relevant and narrow it down. This becomes tedious when dealing with data-sets that have many columns (100+).\r\n\r\nWe have had to create a temporary solution in our fork just to allow our users who rely on it to use the chart explorer. This design aims to reintroduce the select all functionality in a non disruptive way while keeping the UX clean. It is only shown in the columns select when in the raw records query mode in the explore view on the 'table plugin', since this is the place where it is needed by our users.\r\n\r\nThoughts and feedback are appreciated!\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n#### <ins>Drag and Drop Feature Enabled:<ins/>\r\n**SELECT ALL**\r\nWhen the columns field is empty, the select all button can be clicked to populate the columns field with all available options.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/167172650-8bca2bde-a248-4d9d-806d-79ce72075538.png)\r\n\r\n**DESELECT ALL** \r\nOnce any option(s) have been selected, the button text changes to deselect all. If it is clicked in this state, it empties the columns field (and the button text changes back to 'SELECT ALL').\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/167172736-867516b4-9338-49ec-b09e-e8dc8f405466.png)\r\n\r\n#### <ins>Drag and Drop Feature Disabled:</ins>\r\n\\* the columns field is \"full\" when all options are currently selected (list of selected values equals list of options)\r\n**SELECT ALL** \r\nWhen the columns field is not full\\*, the select all button can be clicked to add all remaining options. Since there is already a 'clear' button built in to select control when the Drag and Drop Feature is disabled, the select all button does not turn into a deselect all button when an item is added. This allows a user to select all options without first clearing the values and then selecting all. The user can still clear the values at any time with the 'clear' button. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/167187482-38a6a3ed-359f-4a85-96af-db521af1a280.png)\r\n\r\n**SELECT ALL Disabled** \r\nWhen the columns field is full\\*, the select all button is disabled because all options are currently selected. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102618419/167187631-b9998843-5c24-4d91-8d4b-403f018470dd.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required! What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\n#### <ins>Drag and Drop Feature enabled</ins>\r\n - Explore a chart that uses the 'Table' viz type. \r\n - In the 'Data' tab, under the 'Query' drop down, select 'Raw Records' as the 'Query Mode'.\r\n - For the 'Columns' selector, you should see a 'Select All' or 'Deselect All' button. \r\n - Clicking it should select all options when the button is in select all mode, and should deselect all buttons when in deselect mode.\r\n\r\n#### <ins>Drag and Drop Feature disabled</ins>\r\n - Explore a chart that uses the 'Table' viz type. \r\n - In the 'Data' tab, under the 'Query' drop down, select 'Raw Records' as the 'Query Mode'.\r\n - For the 'Columns' selector, you should see a 'SELECT ALL' button. \r\n - If all options are selected, the button should be disabled. \r\n - Otherwise, the button should be enabled and should select all remaining options.\r\n - The clear button in the selector component should still clear all selected values.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [x] Has

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn `random` and `square` mode, the words rotation of a word cloud chart should be assigned randomly, and be different for each word. Before this PR, all words use the same rotation (derived from the first randomly generated number by seedRandom()).\r\nThis PR fixes that behaviour, and restores the randomness of each word's rotation.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n**Before:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1301204/167131996-c4fa246d-5d0a-4ea8-8658-5701dc1225f8.png)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n**After:**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1301204/167131634-246bc01f-bf47-4178-af8e-14958a75ec6a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCreate a word cloud chart, and select a square or random rotation.

SUMMARY\r\nDue to some missing memoization, table chart was rerendering even on actions unrelated to table itself, like switching tab from Data to Customize or adding a search box to the chart, causing those actions to be laggy. That was especially visible in large tables (with thousands of visible cells). This PR fixes that behaviour.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/167116369-486a72e5-5204-4ab2-9397-e54c287b4516.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/167116410-ebdd7c73-679c-4e79-a249-1c166d6624d5.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n`d3-svg-legend` version 2 is incompatible with `d3` version 3 (see: https://github.com/susielu/d3-legend/issues/58), causing the Heatmap chart to fail to render. I contemplated the option of bumping `d3` to version 4, but decided against it due to the following reasons:\r\n- The API has been totally overhauled in `d3` version 4 and would have required fairly big changes\r\n- `d3` is now on version 7\r\n- `d3-svg-legend` has been stale for 4 years\r\n\r\nInstead I think we should just migrate this plugin to `d3` version 7 or the equivalent ECharts version (https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=heatmap-cartesian) while migrating this plugin to the v1 chart data endpoint.\r\n\r\nRelated PR: #19846\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\n<img width=\"1186\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/167073379-5c5bcef8-f653-44c8-8dea-2bf6dc6c64e8.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\n<img width=\"1185\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/167073502-375494f1-56e1-4be3-a064-c74a8707790c.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThe database connection modal fires a callback when a db is successfully connected.\r\nThe problem is, the database list cannot listen to that callback when the modal is displayed/shown outside of the container.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables that functionality via query params, so that the database list can be notified and refreshed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/167051414-66692bdf-5035-445e-bf54-bca263a71c15.mov\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/167051400-c73503c1-2306-4f44-9354-220f89a0f157.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nGo to the dashboard list and connect a new database from the top \"plus button\" menu.\r\nEnsure you can see the newly connected database without refreshing the page.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in

SUMMARY\r\nHello there,\r\nI'm the author of `sqlalchemy-trino`, which is _[Trino](https://trino.io/) (f.k.a PrestoSQL) dialect for SQLAlchemy._\r\nSince trinodb/trino-python-client#81, all its code of is merged into upstream project. And `sqlalchemy-trino` is deprecated.\r\nSo SuperSet should switch from `sqlalchemy-trino` to `trino-python-client`\r\n\r\nThis PR also update `trino.mdx` docs from #17593, which may being lost during refactoring.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

reducer for `ReportModal` and improve error handling:\r\n\r\n1. Reduce indirectness in the state reducer\r\n2. Refactor `getClientError` to more consistently handle validation `message` from Marshmallow (set the default `\"error\"` message to be the first error of the first validated field).\r\n3. Update the error message for name uniqueness to include the referred duplicate name, to make it sound more friendly\r\n4. Editing a report will also display errors in an inline Alert instead of in a toast\r\n5. Create TS types based on backend enums\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n####

issue with the alert feature, specifically the execution log reports different alert values for different states within the same execution run. Per [this](https://apache-superset.slack.com/archives/G013HAE6Y0K/p1651543102805559) Slack thread the underlying issue is the report schedule synopsis‚Äîfrom which the execution log is created, i.e., a point-in-time snapshot‚Äîis when the state is `WORKING` the `last_value` and `last_value_row_json` need to be cleared otherwise they incorrectly reflect the values of the previous execution run.\r\n\r\nI‚Äôm actually not sure whether there‚Äôs any value logging the `WORKING` state to the execution log. Does it provide any relevant information to the user?\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n#### Before Migration\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1335\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 8 06 09 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/166618425-b871ea01-6897-4d23-986b-7c2fd9fcfec1.png\">\r\n\r\n#### After Migration\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1348\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 8 06 37 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4567245/166618440-76d38a6d-abc3-43bb-896a-f31f34f26f27.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests and migration.

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nIn some of the views we're caching `DatasourceName` namedtuples to Redis using the `memoized_func` decorator. We found that in certain cases the object that comes back from the cache is a list of `[table, schema]`, instead of `DatasourceName(table=table, schema=schema)`, which breaks the view.\r\n\r\nI changed the code in `models/core.py` so that the return value from the memoized functions is a primitive (a tuple of `(table, schema)`), and we rebuild the namedtuple in `views/core.py`, to prevent this bug from happening.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nSome time ago #13622 introduced support for emitting temporal filters from native/cross filters. This caused a regression that was fixed in #16634, which itself caused another regression #17143. The original feature, which relied on creating a custom temporal type that can be used to compile temporal expressions in SQLAlchemy queries proved to be problematic, in part due to the fact that it required using the `DATETIME` type which isn't natvely supported by Presto.\r\n\r\nFor these types of use cases, the documentation recommends creating a custom class that extends `TypeDecorator` and implementing `process_bind_param` and/or `process_literal_value`: https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/custom_types.html#typedecorator-recipes. However, during testing this was shown to not work universally, as some dialects expected the return value to be a `date`/`datetime`, while others expected it to always be a `str`.\r\n\r\nA simpler and universally supported solution is to just use `literal_column`. This simplifies the codebase and should ensure that temporal adhoc filters always work. The temporal conversion functions for Presto, Trino and Athena are also updated to use the recommended casts from the docs (note how `from_iso8601_*` is no longer recommended):\r\n- https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/datetime.html (Presto db. The AWS Athena docs also point to this: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/presto-functions.html)\r\n- https://docs.starburst.io/latest/functions/datetime.html (Starburst)\r\n- https://trino.io/docs/current/functions/datetime.html (Trino)\r\n\r\nNote that this change might be seen as making the `filter_values_handler` helper function slightly messy with the added arguments. However, the function can be streamlined once the native Druid connector is removed and the helper can  be made more specific to the SQLAlchemy model.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't add new tests, as this test covers these changes: https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/aff10a7fad0b6a48c578e70d2746d04bdf4d753c/tests/integration_tests/charts/data/api_tests.py#L359-L397\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a number of issues (some cosmetic) with the SQL username. Specifically:\r\n\r\n1. The username was referred to  as both `username` and `user_name`. The inconsistency added undue complexity.\r\n2. It a number of places the `g.user.username` was passed as the `username` argument of the `get_sqla_engine` function (or similar) even when it was the default fallback. This added unnecessary complexity, i.e., from reading the code it wasn't apparent when/why the username would be overridden. In reality it mostly isn't, i.e., it should always be the logged in user unless the query is being executed from Celery‚Äîwhere there is no user logged in.\r\n3. The logic introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/17499 wasn't suffice, in actuality it likely added more complexity, as although it tried to ensure that the `get_df` for the alert was executed by the passed in user, if the underlying query used Jinja templating for fetching the the latest partition or similar those queries were executed by the user defined in the SQLAlchemy URI (if defined; falling back to the system user)‚Äîleveraging the SQLAlchemy inspector‚Äîper [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/aff10a7fad0b6a48c578e70d2746d04bdf4d753c/superset/models/core.py#L511-L514). \r\n\r\nThe fix for (1) was to rename `user_name` to `username` where possible. For (2) and (3) the combined fix was to actually remove overriding the username in functions given the level of nesting, etc. and rely simply on using `g.user.username`, i.e., the logged in user, as the user (or effective user) for all queries. Given we're using globals via `flask.g`‚ÄîFlask's versions of globals which persist for the duration of the request‚Äîwhy not update it rather than passing around another username everywhere. For instances where there was no user logged in: alerting, async SQL Lab queries, etc. we simply temporarily override the `g.user` using the provided username. Hopefully this approach simplified the code and brought more transparency.\r\n\r\nThe one doubt I had was with how the app context works with Celery and whether `flask.g` is thread safe, though per [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/blob/060b5c0e177b89eff9b6ace83b7df235f25cc198/superset/initialization/__init__.py#L102-L105) it seems we create a new app context for every task.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nCI.

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR enables the popovers in the explore to be closed when hitting the escape key.\r\nAlso, improves the locking of the explore scroll, so that the popovers are pinned to the triggering div until they're closed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo way to visually show the difference, so this is the actual result:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17252075/166059870-309451f9-3eeb-4db5-bb15-f593a2011819.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nIn the explore:\r\n* Try to edit the Data, be it metrics, columns, dimensions, filters, etc, and ensure it continues to work as before\r\n* Hit the escape key while a popover is open and ensure it closes\r\n* Ensure you can still interact with the popver (type, click, etc).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2022-04-29T19:52:00Z","updated_at":"2024-03-13T17:45:32Z","closed_at":"2022-05-13T18:28:39Z","merged_at":"2022-05-13T18:28:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"dbc653d442e48078546210a76df5eb216b30b707","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":3927051516,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs7qEgz8","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/Preset-Patch","name":"Preset-Patch","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":4122192135,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs71s6kH","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/preset:2022.19","name":"preset:2022.19","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":6577531558,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiA0qpg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%9A%A2%202.0.0","name":"üö¢

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adjusts the metrics popover in Explore to:\r\n* When editing the title, hitting enter should save the title as well\r\n* Adjust the size of the view & edit modes so that they take the same height and prevent the popover from changing positions\r\n\r\nAdditionally, took the opportunity to:\r\n* Refactor the file involved to use typescript\r\n* Refactor the tests to use react

SUMMARY\r\nWhen editing a metric in the Explore, the title label that's automatically set when using the Custom SQL mode gets reset if you hover over it/change tabs/interact with the popover.\r\n\r\nThe reason is because the component is always being rerender, and in that case, the metric get's a new id and the label state is lost.\r\n\r\nThis PR caches the metric component so that it only rerenders when needed.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

issue we (Airbnb) were facing after upgrading to Python 3.9. Per https://github.com/boto/s3transfer/issues/197#issuecomment-1016026027 there seems to be an s3 threading with Python 3.9+ causing the transfer to fail. Disabling threading seems to mitigate the issue. Note it's unclear what the potential performance impact is, especially when uploading large files.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable

SUMMARY\r\nThe \"Allow this database to be explored\" setting should be checked by default in the Database Connection UI.\r\n\r\n**Description**\r\nWhen creating a new database connection, users are able to control which actions should be allowed on this database:\r\nBy default, Allow this database to be explored is un-checked, however this functionality is enabled on the application.\r\n\r\nThe functionality of Exploring from SQL Lab should match the Database connection UI checkbox. Since the functionality is enabled, the checkbox should be checked by default when creating a new connection.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBEFORE:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47900232/165761337-588d83db-a192-4e2d-997c-191388536a7d.mov\r\n\r\nAFTER:\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47900232/165761311-a7c1c606-6613-44b3-8e27-2119d06d78f4.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n**How to reproduce the bug**\r\n\r\n1. Create a new Database connection. (Google sheets is a quick one to create)\r\n2. Expand the SQL Lab section under the ADVANCED tab, and make sure that Allow this database to be explored is disabled.\r\n3. Save the connection.\r\n4. However, the functionality is working as if the box was checked:\r\n5. Navigate to SQL Lab > SQL Editor on the top navigation bar.\r\n6. Execute a query on this newly connected database.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing

SUMMARY\r\nAdd some polish to the new Handlebars plugin:\r\n- add debounce to template and style controls to avoid rerendering on each keypress\r\n- fix height and width to fix buggy overflow + default to auto scroll\r\n- add `stringify` helper to make it more convenient to inspect the rows in the data array\r\n- update example template and CSS code to be more intuitive\r\n- avoid resetting controls when switching between aggregate and raw mode\r\n- clean up dependencies\r\n- remove redundant comments/code\r\n\r\n###

SUMMARY\r\nThe metric tooltip gets in the way of re-ordering metrics, dragging over to lower the metric in the list doesn't work.\r\n\r\nThere's an architecture already in place to handle the dragging for other scenarios. This PR expands that to include the metrics, by disabling the tooltip on drag.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nThis PR adds a class to all dashboard charts, referencing their `chartID` as `dashboard-chart-id-{X}` as seen here:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"665\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2022-04-26_at_11_28_15_PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/165609687-0edc7129-a13b-45dc-a9b7-ffb7b05a90a3.png\">\r\n\r\nThis allows you to more reliably target a particular chart and do wacky CSS things with it, like so:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1219\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-04-26 at 11 26 10 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/812905/165610573-46ff3a7d-8114-41ef-8baf-733348d6adad.png\">\r\n\r\nWhat you do with this new found power is up to you, and at your own risk... but it's easier to do it for a particular chart now, anyway, even if someone moves charts around on a dashboard, which was the main point of fragility in `nth-of-type` selector approaches.\r\n\r\nThe world is now your oyster\r\n<img width=\"314\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-04-26 at 11 26 45 PM\"

What steps can be taken to manually verify the changes? -->\r\nPoke around at it!

SUMMARY\r\nMultiple small cosmetic tweaks to Explore:\r\n- Use the `alert` color for the \"Altered\" pill instead of the current mustardy one\r\n- Add `alert` type to `Label` component. I didn't migrate the `AlteredSliceTag` to the new component yet as the dark colors are slightly off in the `alert` color (the outline is set to the dark color if the label has a click handler). Will do it in a follow up once the colors are sorted out.\r\n- Remove redundant tooltip from `RowCount` pill\r\n- Remove `suffix` prop from `RowCount` component for consistency and make `rowCount` prop optional\r\n- Use pluralized translation for `RowCount`: when row count is one, the result is \"1 row\", otherwise \"2 rows\" etc\r\n- Capitalize \"cached\" to \"Cached\" to be in line with \"Altered\" pill\r\n- Convert some tests from JS to TS and migrate from Enzyme to RTL.\r\n\r\n### AFTER\r\nChanges after (\"1 row\"/\"4 rows\" (pluralized), same `RowCount` for Results and Chart container, no tooltip for `RowCount` pill, capitalized \"Cached\", yellow \"Altered\" pill)\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/165481521-b76dc8a3-e508-4514-93c4-f7fc231fdd05.mp4\r\n\r\nThe new `Label` storybook with `alert` type:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"929\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/165688434-18fb3651-1abb-469f-87c5-1fdc0d2e98e8.png\">\r\n\r\nThe new `RowCount` storybook with singular/plural entries and removed `suffix`:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"111\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/165482863-a97b3b6a-604f-46ab-acc0-05267d351e7a.png\">\r\n\r\n### BEFORE\r\nChanges after (\"1 rows\"/\"4 rows\" (always pluralized), different `RowCount` for Results and Chart container, redundant tooltip for `RowCount` pill, uncapitalized \"cached\", mustardy \"Altered\" pill)\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/165482105-0d6e814d-53b9-4219-843c-0d764d5b449f.mp4\r\n\r\nPrevious storybooks:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"830\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/165482298-6279cca9-59bd-435f-9be7-78f924750f17.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"89\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/165482671-ff2d56c8-17d5-4469-a14d-60484e5f3545.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWe hit this error internally because we allow non owners to view dashboards that are in draft mode, but then when the report DAO returned a dashboard not found error, it crashed the page. While the true fix for us is overriding the access controls for draft mode dashboards, this is also a clear bug where the error payload may not contain a `name` attribute, and thus trying to get the first element of that isn't possible.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI, will test in our local environment to verify\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR introduces a Github workflow to test the Storybook Netlify instance nightly (at midnight).\r\n\r\nThe flow works as follows:\r\n\r\n- Netlify builds a Storybook on every push on master. The built Storybook instance is publicly available here: [Superset Storybook](https://superset-storybook.netlify.app/). No action is required from our side as Netlify watches the repo and does the build automatically\r\n- The Github workflow included in this PR will test the Storybook instance nightly at midnight using Applitools\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated
