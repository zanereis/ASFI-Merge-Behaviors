of C++ library compiles with RTTI enabled. LLVM by default compiles with ```fno-rtti```. This creates some trouble of direct linking tvm from existing libraries which need RTTI.\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to resolve this issue by\r\n- Compile the llvm related code with ```fno-rtti```\r\n- Compile other code with RTTI enabled\r\n- Because Internally TVM interacts with LLVM related module via minimum interface (Module) codegen, in theory this could work as long as TVM resolve this cross linking issue.\r\n\r\nThe assumption is that ```no-rtti``` code can still inheritate and use data structure from code compiled with rtti, (this is true as long as the vtable data structure is the same). Note that it is not possible other way around.

linux.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-30T21:43:28Z","updated_at":"2017-05-31T04:18:02Z","closed_at":"2017-05-31T04:17:53Z","merged_at":"2017-05-31T04:17:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"560463e9dca6d1ebced9411836947bc98fa47f81","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/161/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/161/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/161/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/4679c5982b8d708c620ea0ab2bf4e67b5a31cba7","head":{"label":"tqchen:master","ref":"master","sha":"4679c5982b8d708c620ea0ab2bf4e67b5a31cba7","user":{"login":"tqchen","id":2577440,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Nzc0NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2577440?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen","html_url":"https://github.com/tqchen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tqchen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"1efc4ca005e534233d77de1a1c4dddaf69510dad","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":70746484,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MDc0NjQ4NA==","name":"tvm","full_name":"apache/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/tvm","description":"Open

PR gives a basic example for cross compile test workflow, see https://github.com/tqchen/tvm/blob/master/tests/python/unittest/test_codegen_cross_llvm.py#L34\r\n\r\nThe workflow\r\n- Compile TVM with runtime only on the target board\r\n   - Add ```BUILD_TARGETS = lib/libtvm_runtime.so``` to config.mk\r\n   - Add TVM_USE_RUNTIME_LIB=1 to environment variable\r\n   - ```python -m tvm.exec.rpc_server```\r\n- Build target with specific flag\r\n- Save the .o file to the path\r\n- Upload the .o file to the remote RPC server, this case it is an arm board\r\n    - In this example we do the shared library creation on remote use gcc\r\n    - Optionally, we can use local cross compile tool to generate the .so file, and upload the shared library\r\n- Use tvm rpc to run the

many scenarios we want to target devices that do not necessarily have a TVM compiler stack, for example arm board or phones. In these cases, we still want to automate the test-flows in the same way we did for gpus. RPC runtime is used to solve this problem.\r\n\r\n- The target environment only need to have tvm runtime and rpc server, which is minimum\r\n- We run compiler on a host server, connect to the target board, and run tests on the target board\r\n\r\nExample workflow, see also https://github.com/dmlc/tvm/blob/master/tests/python/unittest/test_runtime_rpc.py\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm.contrib import rpc\r\n\r\ndef test_remote():\r\n    # build the code locally\r\n    n = tvm.convert(1024)\r\n    A = tvm.placeholder((n,), name='A')\r\n    B = tvm.compute(A.shape, lambda *i: A(*i) + 1.0, name='B')\r\n    s = tvm.create_schedule(B.op)\r\n    f = tvm.build(s, [A, B], target_of_board_arch, name=\"myadd\")\r\n    f.export_library(\"mylib.so\")\r\n    # connect to remote
