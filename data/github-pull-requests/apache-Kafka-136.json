However, this design could result in a lag which some users could not afford to let happen. For example, lets say a consumer crashed at offset 100, with the last checkpointed offset being at 70. When it recovers at a later offset (say, 120), it will be behind by an offset range of 50 (120 - 70). This is because the consumer restarted at 70, forcing it to reprocess old data. To avoid this from happening, one option would be to allow the current consumer to start processing not from the last checkpointed offset (which is 70 in the example), but from 120 where it recovers. Meanwhile, a new KafkaConsumer will be instantiated and start reading from offset 70 in concurrency with the old process, and will be terminated once it reaches 120. In this manner, a considerable amount of lag can be avoided, particularly since the old consumer could proceed as if nothing had happened. \r\n\r\nHere is the design doc for the pull request:

not update LogReadResult after it is initially populated when returning fetches immediately (i.e. without hitting the purgatory). This was done in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/3954 as optimization so that followers get most recent high watermark and log start offset. However, since many things can happen (like deleting old segments and advancing log start offset) between initial creation of LogReadResult and the update, we can hit issues like log start offset in fetch response being higher than the last offset in fetched records. \r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test

is possible for replica_verificaiton_test to fail with a `RemoteCommandError` when `self.stop_producer()` is called. This looks like a timing issue, as the implementation for `BackgroundThreadService#stop` is the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def stop(self):\r\n        alive_workers = [worker for worker in self.worker_threads.itervalues() if worker.is_alive()]\r\n        if len(alive_workers) > 0:\r\n            self.logger.debug(\r\n                \"Called stop with at least one worker thread is still running: \" + str(alive_workers))\r\n\r\n            self.logger.debug(\"%s\" % str(self.worker_threads))\r\n\r\n        super(BackgroundThreadService, self).stop()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the worker exits after the point `alive_workers` is constructed.\r\n\r\n`VerifiableProducer#stop` expects the process to exist, and sets `allow_fail` to `false`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def stop_node(self, node):\r\n        self.kill_node(node, clean_shutdown=True, allow_fail=False)\r\n\r\n        stopped = self.wait_node(node, timeout_sec=self.stop_timeout_sec)\r\n        assert stopped, \"Node %s: did not stop within the specified timeout of %s seconds\" % \\\r\n                        (str(node.account), str(self.stop_timeout_sec))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a wait to make sure the producer has finished before we try to stop it.","created_at":"2018-06-27T19:04:05Z","updated_at":"2019-05-07T05:29:47Z","closed_at":"2019-05-07T05:29:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d03a9cef547248677c17809f8be062512f942eeb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rajinisivaram","id":13164074,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMTY0MDc0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13164074?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram","html_url":"https://github.com/rajinisivaram","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rajinisivaram/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5304/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5304/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5304/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/68fda1d1a9f7305ed3802bcd1697fc2648718630","head":{"label":"dhruvilshah3:replica-verification","ref":"replica-verification","sha":"68fda1d1a9f7305ed3802bcd1697fc2648718630","user":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":121815241,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjE4MTUyNDE=","name":"kafka","full_name":"dhruvilshah3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dhruvilshah3","id":14958864,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTU4ODY0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14958864?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3","html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dhruvilshah3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dhruvilshah3/kafka","description":"Mirror

the current implementation of sticky assignor the leader does not cache the most recent calculated assignment. It relies on the fact that each consumer in the group sends its subscribed topics and also its current assignment when a rebalance occurs. This could lead to the issue described in [KAFKA-7026](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-7026), in which current assignment of a consumer is no longer valid and should be ignored. The solution implemented in this PR involves the leader caching the most recent assignment of each consumer, so the assignment reported by a consumer can be properly validated (and ignored if

if a client has assigned topics : T1, T2, T3 and calls poll(), the poll might fetch data for partitions for all 3 topics T1, T2, T3. Now if the client unassigns some topics (for example T3) and calls poll() we still hold the data (for T3) in the completedFetches queue until we actually reach the buffered data for the unassigned Topics (T3 in our example) on subsequent poll() calls, at which point we drop that data. This process of holding the data is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhen a client creates a topic, it takes time for the broker to fetch ACLs for the topic. But during this time, the client will issue fetchRequest for the topic, it will get response for the partitions of this topic. The response consist of TopicAuthorizationException for each of the partitions. This response for each partition is wrapped with a completedFetch and added to the completedFetches queue. Now when the client calls the next poll() it sees the TopicAuthorizationException from the first buffered CompletedFetch. At this point the client chooses to sleep for 1.5 min as a backoff (as per the design), hoping that the Broker fetches the ACL from ACL store in the meantime. Actually the Broker has already fetched the ACL by this time. When the client calls poll() after the sleep, it again sees the TopicAuthorizationException from the second completedFetch and it sleeps again. So it takes (1.5 * 60 * partitions) seconds before the client can see any data. With this patch, the client when it sees the first TopicAuthorizationException, it can all assign(EmptySet), which will get rid of the buffered completedFetches (those with TopicAuthorizationException) and it can again call assign(TopicPartitions) before calling poll(). With this patch we found that client was able to get the records as soon as the Broker fetched the ACLs from ACL store.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-06-25T20:21:45Z","updated_at":"2018-09-11T04:44:07Z","closed_at":"2018-09-11T04:44:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"90dd0e5df4bebe2602a2aaa4929edb15c81f2b1c","assignee":{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"lindong28","id":5873403,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NzM0MDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5873403?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28","html_url":"https://github.com/lindong28","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lindong28/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5289/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/5289/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/5289/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/ecb1a70308523598ce89a002f72f32bf1deb5a1e","head":{"label":"MayureshGharat:KAFKA-7096","ref":"KAFKA-7096","sha":"ecb1a70308523598ce89a002f72f32bf1deb5a1e","user":{"login":"MayureshGharat","id":4326831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjY4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4326831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat","html_url":"https://github.com/MayureshGharat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":43786685,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mzc4NjY4NQ==","name":"kafka","full_name":"MayureshGharat/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"MayureshGharat","id":4326831,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMjY4MzE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4326831?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat","html_url":"https://github.com/MayureshGharat","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MayureshGharat/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/MayureshGharat/kafka","description":"Mirror

an exception is caught in ConsumerGroupCommand command line utility it does not print the stack trace, this could lead to crucial information regarding the error to not be displayed to the user.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, when misconfiguring consumer configuration the user will only see the message:\r\n```\r\nError: Executing consumer group command failed due to Failed to construct kafka consumer\r\n```\r\nThis happens since [the code which instantiates this exception](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/2.0.0-rc0/clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/consumer/KafkaConsumer.java#L795) does not add all relevant information in the message but rather in the \"cause\" member.\r\n\r\nIn order to find out the issue I had to compile Kafka and debug this code to find out that the error was due to a misconfiguration of the consumer:\r\n```\r\nCaused by: org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigException: request.timeout.ms should be greater than session.timeout.ms and fetch.max.wait.ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuggested change is to simply print the stack traces since this is a command line utility (same as the error is printed in the line preceding this one). This will provide the user with the most information for cases like these when the exception message is not sufficient.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify

is an update `TopologyDescription.Sink` and `TopologyDescription.Source`.\r\n\r\nThe original intent for `TopologyDescription` was to provide users with an interface to perform runtime checking of Topologies. However, `TopologyDescription` has relied too heavily on returning strings as representations of various inner components of Topologies such as topics, topic pattern, etc. This PR instead changes the return types to that of the underlying object and relies on the `toString()` method of these objects to maintain their human readable representations.\r\n\r\nMore details are outlined in this PR's
