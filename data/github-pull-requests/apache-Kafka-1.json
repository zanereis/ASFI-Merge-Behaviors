the streams smoke test, flush records that are appended to the input topics, to advance the stream time so that all suppressed windows are flushed at the end of the test.

our organization, we use a custom Kafka authorizer that makes decisions based on client roles assigned by our IAM server. We've also implemented a custom `PlainServerCallbackHandler` that authenticates clients using their username and password through the IAM server. The IAM server also returns client info, such as assigned roles, but we're facing an issue—`PlainSaslServer` can only pass the authorizationID to the authorizer, meaning the client info is lost. To solve this, we want to extend `PlainSaslServer` so it can pass client info through the negotiated properties.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design

PR does the following:\r\n- Refactors ShareGroupMetrics out of SharePartitionManager as there are additional metrics need to be defined, as per KIP-1103, where ShareGroupMetrics is required to be pass to DelayedShareFetch, etc.\r\n- As the KIP-1103 defines metrics which are Histogram in ShareGroupMetrics, also the BrokerTopicMetrics are Yammer metrics hence to maintian consistency, I  moved existing ShareGroupMetrics (defined in KIP-932) also to Yammer metrics following Yammer metrics group naming convention i.e. from share-group-metrics to ShareGroupMetrics (this will require KIP-932 upadate where `share-acknowledgement` metric is already moved to BrokerTopicMetrics and other 2 in this PR to Yammer metrics).\r\n- Moved `record-acknowledgement-rate|count` to Yammer meter metric with name `RecordAcknowledgementPerSec`.\r\n- Moved `partition-load-time-avg|max` to Yammer histogram metric with name `PartitionLoadTimeMs`.\r\n- Corrects the way partition load time metrics was calculated. The load time of share partition should be considered when the state of share partition moves from `empty` which happens once mayBeInitialize finishes. The existing implementation is not much helpful now since share partition initialization is now async, at the time of this metric implementation the initialization of share partition was sync hence the metric needed correction.\r\n\r\nThis PR is first step to start implementing other ShareGroupMetrics as defined in KIP-1103.","created_at":"2025-02-06T22:50:36Z","updated_at":"2025-02-07T16:07:08Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3f913bf6b2faacec32db985e18d8aa0407281a1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"AndrewJSchofield","id":13795597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzNzk1NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13795597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield","html_url":"https://github.com/AndrewJSchofield","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AndrewJSchofield/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":838330122,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzgzMzAxMjI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/core","name":"core","color":"ed5a86","default":false,"description":"Kafka

PR handles slicing of fetched records based on acquire response for share fetch. There could be additional bytes fetched from log but acquired offsets can be a subset, typically with `max fetch records` configuration. Rather sending additional bytes of fetched data to client we should slice the file and wire only needed batches.\r\n\r\nNote: If the acquired offsets are within a batch then we need to send the entire batch within the file record. Hence rather checking for inidividual batches, PR finds the first and last acquired offset, and trims the file for all batches between (inclusive) these two offsets.

On `poll()`, if there is any locally-buffered data, the `ClassicKafkaConsumer` does not fetch _any_ new data and simply returns the buffered data to the user from `poll()`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the `AsyncKafkaConsumer` consumer splits its logic and network I/O between two threads, which results in a potential race condition during fetch. The `AsyncKafkaConsumer` also checks for buffered data on its application thread. If it finds there is none, it signals the background thread to create a fetch request. However, it's possible for the background thread to receive data from a previous fetch and buffer it before the fetch request logic starts. When that occurs, as the background thread creates a new fetch request, it skips any buffered data, which has the unintended result that those partitions get added to the fetch request's \"to remove\" set. This signals to the broker to remove those partitions from its internal cache.\r\n\r\nThis issue is technically possible in the `ClassicKafkaConsumer` too, since the heartbeat thread performs network I/O in addition to the application thread. However, because of the frequency at which the `AsyncKafkaConsumer`'s background thread runs, it is ~100x more likely to happen.\r\n\r\n# Options\r\n\r\nThe core decision is: what should the background thread do if it is asked to create a fetch request and it discovers there's buffered data. There were multiple proposals to address this issue in the `AsyncKafkaConsumer`. Among them are:\r\n\r\n1. The background thread should omit buffered partitions from the fetch request as before (this is the existing behavior)\r\n2. The background thread should skip the fetch request generation entirely if there are *any* buffered partitions\r\n3. The background thread should include buffered partitions in the fetch request, but use a small “max bytes” value\r\n4. The background thread should skip fetching from the nodes that have buffered partitions\r\n\r\nOption 4 won out. The change is localized to `AbstractFetch` where the basic idea is to skip fetch requests to a given node if that node is the leader for buffered data. By preventing a fetch request from being sent to that node, it won't have any \"holes\" where the buffered partitions should be.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Eviction rate testing\r\n\r\nHere are the results of our internal stress testing:\r\n\r\n- `ClassicKafkaConsumer`—after the initial spike during test start up, the average rate settles down to ~0.14 evictions/second ![CLASSIC](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b13c46a2-226f-44c9-a8c5-d6dc0d38d40e)\r\n- `AsyncKafkaConsumer`, (w/o fix)—after startup, the evictions still settle down, but they are about 100x higher than the `ClassicKafkaConsumer` at ~1.48 evictions/second ![CONSUMER-before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dca5ff7f-74bd-4174-b6e6-39c4e8479684)\r\n- `AsyncKafkaConsumer` (w/ fix)—the eviction rate is now closer to the `ClassicKafkaConsumer` at ~0.22 evictions/second ![CONSUMER-after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19009791-d63e-411d-96ed-b49605f93325)\r\n\r\n## `EndToEndLatency` testing\r\n\r\nThe bundled `EndToEndLatency` test runner was executed on a single machine using Docker. The `apache/kafka:latest` Docker image was used and either the `cluster/combined/plaintext/docker-compose.yml` or `single-node/plaintext/docker-compose.yml` Docker Compose configuration files, depending on the test. The Docker containers were recreated from scratch before each test.\r\n\r\nA single topic was created with 30 partitions and with a replication factor of either 1 or 3, depending on a single- or multi-node setup.\r\n\r\nFor each of the test runs these argument values were used:\r\n\r\n- Message count: 100000\r\n- `acks`: 1\r\n- Message size: 128 bytes\r\n\r\nA configuration file which contained a single configuration value of `group.protocol=<$group_protocol>` was also provided to the test, where `$group_protocol` was either `CLASSIC` or `CONSUMER`.\r\n\r\n### Test results\r\n\r\n#### Test 1—`CLASSIC` group protocol, cluster size: 3 nodes, replication factor: 3\r\n\r\n| Metric            | `trunk` | PR     |\r\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| Average latency   |  1.4901 | 1.4871 |\r\n| 50th percentile   |       1 |      1 |\r\n| 99th percentile   |       3 |      3 |\r\n| 99.9th percentile |       6 |      6 | \r\n\r\n#### Test 2—`CONSUMER` group protocol, cluster size: 3 nodes, replication factor: 3\r\n\r\n| Metric            | `trunk` | PR     |\r\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| Average latency   |  1.4704 | 1.4807 |\r\n| 50th percentile   |       1 |      1 |\r\n| 99th percentile   |       3 |      3 |\r\n| 99.9th percentile |       6 |      7 | \r\n\r\n#### Test 3—`CLASSIC` group protocol, cluster size: 1 node, replication factor: 1\r\n\r\n| Metric            | `trunk` | PR     |\r\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| Average latency   |  1.0777 | 1.0193 |\r\n| 50th percentile   |       1 |      1 |\r\n| 99th percentile   |       2 |      2 |\r\n| 99.9th percentile |       5 |      4 | \r\n\r\n#### Test 4—`CONSUMER` group protocol, cluster size: 1 node, replication factor: 1\r\n\r\n| Metric            | `trunk` | PR     |\r\n|-------------------|---------|--------|\r\n| Average latency   |  1.0937 | 1.0503 |\r\n| 50th percentile   |       1 |      1 |\r\n| 99th percentile   |       2 |      2 |\r\n| 99.9th percentile |       4 |      4 | \r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nThese tests did not reveal any significant differences between the current fetcher logic on `trunk` and the one proposed in this PR. Addition test runs using larger message counts and/or larger message sizes did not affect the result.","created_at":"2025-02-04T00:20:52Z","updated_at":"2025-02-08T02:39:45Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f96eaf87a331353ba7960dea7359ce9dcc279e99","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"jeffkbkim","id":19479897,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NDc5ODk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19479897?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim","html_url":"https://github.com/jeffkbkim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeffkbkim/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"lianetm","id":98415067,"node_id":"U_kgDOBd2x2w","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/98415067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm","html_url":"https://github.com/lianetm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lianetm/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851033232,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzMyMzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/consumer","name":"consumer","color":"bf6a03","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4771354362,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABHGUW-g","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/KIP-848","name":"KIP-848","color":"0E87F1","default":false,"description":"The

patch cherry-picks https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/18749 to 4.0 branch.\r\n\r\nCoordinatorRecordSerde does not validate the version of the value to check whether the version is supported by the current version of the software. This is problematic if a future and unsupported version of the record is read by an older version of the software because it would misinterpret the bytes. Hence CoordinatorRecordSerde must throw an error if the version is unknown. This is also consistent with the handling in the old coordinator.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage

of splitting the tests into \"new\", \"flaky\", and the rest. This consolidates build.gradle down to a single \"test\" target with some runtime properties to control what tests are run.\r\n\r\n* kafka.test.catalog.file: path to test catalog\r\n* kafka.test.run.quarantined: include auto-quarantined (i.e., \"new\") tests. this depends on the age of the test catalog\r\n* kafka.test.run.flaky: include tests marked as `@Flaky` (replaces the `excludeTags 'flaky'` directive)\r\n* maxTestRetries: how many retries to allow via Develocity retry plugin (default 0)\r\n* maxTestRetryFailures: how many failures to allow before stopping retries (default 0)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this is to simplify some of the build code (less duplication) as well as enable us to run a new PR validation job that only runs new tests. This new job would be run without retries to discourage the addition of flaky tests.\r\n\r\nFor trunk, we would continue to load the test catalog from 7 days prior. We would run two test jobs:\r\n\r\nTrunk Job 1: Main test suite\r\n====================\r\n```\r\nkafka.test.catalog.file=path/to/test-catalog-from-7-days-prior.txt\r\nkafka.test.run.quarantined=false\r\nkafka.test.run.flaky=false\r\nmaxTestRetries=1\r\nmaxTestRetryFailures=0\r\n```\r\nThis will run all tests not marked as flaky and tests not added within the last 7 days. Only one retry will be allowed per test.\r\n\r\nTrunk Job 2: Quarantined test suite\r\n==========================\r\n```\r\nkafka.test.catalog.file=path/to/test-catalog-from-7-days-prior.txt\r\nkafka.test.run.quarantined=true\r\nkafka.test.run.flaky=true\r\nmaxTestRetries=3\r\nmaxTestRetryFailures=0\r\n```\r\nThis will run all tests marked as flaky and tests which were added in the last 7 days. Up to three retries will be allowed per test.\r\n\r\nTest Catalog\r\n=========\r\nThe test catalog is built from trunk. The union of the results from trunk job 1 and trunk job 2 include all tests.\r\n\r\nPR Job 1: Main test suite\r\n====================\r\nThe same as trunk job 1. The same parameters are given so we can benefit from caching.\r\n\r\nPR Job 2: Flaky test suite\r\n====================\r\nThe same as trunk job 2. The same parameters are given so we can benefit from caching.\r\n\r\nPR Job 3: New test suite\r\n====================\r\nA new test job that only runs tests added by the PR. Unlike the quarantined job on trunk, we want this job to be conservative with retries. This will help us avoid adding flaky tests.\r\n```\r\nkafka.test.catalog.file=path/to/test-catalog-from-0-days-prior.txt\r\nkafka.test.run.quarantined=true\r\nkafka.test.run.flaky=false\r\nmaxTestRetries=0\r\nmaxTestRetryFailures=0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-31T17:53:45Z","updated_at":"2025-02-06T15:54:11Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4d07b90c4b70038892def8cb1a4822fa53b0a4ae","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"chia7712","id":6234750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzQ3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6234750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712","html_url":"https://github.com/chia7712","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":7388474305,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABuGMrwQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/build","name":"build","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"Gradle

exception stack trace shown in the ticket can happen when we are concurrently closing the producer because of an error and doing a regular close. This is not a bug in the test, but a real race condition that can happen in the production code.\r\n\r\nThe sequence is this:\r\n\r\nThread1: Enter PENDING_ERROR\r\nThread2: Check if state is already ERROR\r\nThread1: Transition to ERROR\r\nThread2: Check if state is already PENDING_ERROR\r\nThread2: Transition to PENDING_SHUTDOWN\r\n\r\nOne idea to fix this would be to synchronize the sequence performed by Thread1 using the state lock (this seems to be suggested in the ticket). However, this would require larger changes, since we cannot use the normal state transition method `setState` while owning the lock, as it calls user-defined callbacks. Calling the user-defined callback while owning the lock may create deadlocks. Also, the code would become more complex, since we cannot wait for state transitions while owning the lock - it's not as simple as putting a `synchronized(stateLock)` around everything.\r\n\r\nTo avoid adding more synchronization, this change proposes to fix it by _first_ attempting to transition to PENDING_SHUTDOWN, and _then_ checking whether another thread is already attempting to shut down (states PENDING_SHUTDOWN, PENDING_ERROR, ERROR, NOT_RUNNING), if the state transition fails. This way, we can react correctly to an already shutting down an application. `setState` acts as a test-and-set operation that prevents multiple threads from entering the critical section which starts the shutdown helper.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify

PR corrects the check which was introduced in https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/5332 where `position` is checked to be within boundaries of file. However the check `position > currentSizeInBytes - start`:\r\n1. shall always fail when the slice of file record has moved `start`, and `size` of the slice is lesser than `start` position.\r\n2. is incorrect, as the `position` is relative to `start` hence there can be data which could be further sliced but as `start` is subtracted from `size` then it might fail.\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids subtracting `start` from available `size` as the `position` for slicing is already relative to the start hence just checking if the `position` is lesser than the `size` confirms the boundary.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-31T00:14:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-31T23:43:51Z","closed_at":"2025-01-31T23:43:51Z","merged_at":"2025-01-31T23:43:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"484ba83f5968285a1a93bd1b3632e26bf5c21fb1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"ijuma","id":24747,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0NzQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24747?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma","html_url":"https://github.com/ijuma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ijuma/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"chia7712","id":6234750,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyMzQ3NTA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6234750?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712","html_url":"https://github.com/chia7712","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chia7712/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":7491388177,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABvoWDEQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/clients","name":"clients","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":7522931565,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABwGbTbQ","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/ci-approved","name":"ci-approved","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":7559660738,"node_id":"LA_kwDOACG9q88AAAABwpdEwg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/small","name":"small","color":"FEF2C0","default":false,"description":"Small
