NOT MERGE***\r\n\r\n@piiswrong @tqchen @mli \r\n\r\nThis branch is for engine refactor. Here is the change needed to fix the memory consumption problem mentioned in #4294 . This is the current solution (though not ideal). More details and thinkings on this problem are in the document I sent to you.\r\n\r\nBasic idea:\r\n* Assign a decreasing priority to operators based on their pushed order.\r\n* In such way, if pushed operators could be paralleled, their execution order will be close to the sequential order as much as possible.\r\n\r\nFor following example:\r\n```python\r\nx = mx.nd.zeros((128, 4096), ctx=mx.gpu(0))\r\ndy = mx.nd.zeros((128, 4096), ctx=mx.gpu(0))\r\ndw = mx.nd.zeros((4096, 4096), ctx=mx.gpu(0))\r\n\r\nfor i in range(10000):\r\n   dw += mx.nd.dot(x.T, dy)\r\n\r\ndw.wait_to_read()\r\n```\r\n\r\nPrevious engine will raise OOM error. This change will use <500 MB memory.\r\n\r\nI want to let MinPy use this version of MXNet in the future to make everything more stable. Please have a look.\r\n\r\nThanks.","created_at":"2017-01-02T16:17:01Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T14:47:41Z","closed_at":"2017-01-05T14:47:41Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"21ffbb7faa3986be33583e86fdfd6a83f732bcea","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4495/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/4495/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/4495/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/676494eff331569dbd9ed55f3870e74a2cf0878e","head":{"label":"apache:engine","ref":"engine","sha":"676494eff331569dbd9ed55f3870e74a2cf0878e","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34864402,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDg2NDQwMg==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"apache/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,
