got a bit confused and reckless on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31858 while dealing with a sizable merge conflict, proceeded to disable many cypress tests, many of which are or may be flaky at times, but in this instance were probably triggered by some real issues in that PR. \r\n\r\nRenabling them all and will monitor PRs and master merges to re-disable the ones flaking as needed.\r\n\r\nNote that prior to the PR issues I created on https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31858, there were all sorts of cypress issues that we couldn't pinpoint to any particular merges, and that led a few of us to make to call to \"disable all flaking tests\" with the intent to fix or replace with unit tests:\r\n<img width=\"851\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 9 41 17 PM\"

brought in an intricate issue while trying to style the ErrorBoundary. Somehow was triggering a loop of auto-height-expanding in the Explore app.\r\n\r\nAnother related issue was around introducing `Layout.Content` in the App.tsx file, was creating issues with SQL Lab rendering the tab-content.\r\n\r\nHere my solution is to pass a css prop to the boundary, which carries through to the `Alert` component. Here styling the boundary object ultimately styles the Alert, while passing the style props through ErrorAlert.\r\n\r\nCould implement full emotion interface with `className` and `css` but decided to go minimalist and only pass what we need (`style`)\r\n<img width=\"976\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 7 28 28 PM\"

SUMMARY\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31858#pullrequestreview-2567399027\r\n\r\nIn #31858, unnecessary space was created on all pages due to the div with added padding.\r\n|Before|After|\r\n|--|--|\r\n|![Screenshot_2025-01-27_at_6_20_03 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12c2dfec-ac2d-4a4c-8f9a-7cf1c0cea5f2)|![Screenshot_2025-01-27_at_6_19_44 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a776daf8-60b0-4a27-b741-166ca25bfbf1)\r\n\r\nThe intention of this padding was to provide [space for the alert container](https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31858#issuecomment-2593398152). To resolve this issue, I removed the div and added margin to the ErrorBoundary in the App container instead. \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 6 03 47 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b26db8f7-7857-4cbd-ae71-bc61873fc027)\r\nAdditionally, the Layout.Content component caused issues with the full page height, resulting in improper rendering of the SQL Lab tab. This was fixed by adding `display:flex`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n|Before|After|\r\n|--|--|\r\n|![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 6 20 26 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb3c95f5-2eec-4dbf-8df9-1ba36950504c)|![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 6 20 10 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d36af505-2346-4ab8-b6d4-1dc65d3b09c5)|\r\n|![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 6 19 44 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2bde732-ca73-46a7-8e33-080ad35d08e9)|![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 6 20 03 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfc1addc-2c55-4292-ab89-08960b457954)|\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nThe current Kubernetes installation instructions are subtly incorrect: if you use the bootstrapScript as it is, Superset may fail to start since psycopg2 source package can't be built without a C compiler. Luckily, an official binary package is available and seems to work with Superset's images.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nFollow the instructions to deploy Superset on Kubernetes with Helm. Use bootstrapScript to add some driver, e.g. Bigquery one should work.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR introduces a new Handlebars helper, parseJson, which enhances the functionality of Handlebars templates in Apache Superset. The helper allows the processing of more complex data structures, such as arrays containing nested arrays, by safely parsing JSON strings into JavaScript arrays\r\n\r\nUsage Example:\r\n\r\nHere’s an example that demonstrates how parseJson enables iteration over nested arrays in Handlebars templates:\r\n`data` object: \r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"category\": \"Fruits\",\r\n    \"items\": [\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"category\": \"Vegetables\",\r\n    \"items\": [\"Carrot\", \"Broccoli\", \"Spinach\"]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHandlebars template:\r\n```\r\n<div>\r\n  {{#each data}}\r\n    <h2>{{this.category}}</h2>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      {{#each (parseJson this.items)}}\r\n        <li>{{this}}</li>\r\n      {{/each}}\r\n    </ul>\r\n  {{/each}}\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a Dataset\r\n1.1. Navigate to the Datasets tab in Superset and create dataset containing nested arrays. (You can use data from example)\r\n2. Create a Handlebars Chart\r\n2.1. Go to the Charts tab\r\n2.2. Select + Chart, and choose Handlebars Chart.\r\n2.3. Select the `Nested Array Dataset` and use the template from usage example\r\n3. Confirm the chart renders nested arrays as lists.\r\n4. Test Pre-Change Behavior\r\n4.1. Remove (parseJson) from the template and verify that list is not properly handled.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes

reviewing https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/30134 which seemed to make heavy use of `getBootstrapData`, I realized that it's used 21 times across the codebase, while it may be a fairly expensive operation (JSON.parse on an object that may be significant in size at times (?)).\r\n\r\nNow it's easy to do module-level caching here and ensures that `JSON.parse` happens only once per SPA-load, but opening this as a DRAFT as we probably already store it in other places (didn't dig in, but it's probably stored in a redux store or component state somewhere...).\r\n\r\nTradeoff here is compute VS memory, and clearly we need this object in memory somewhere, but probably in most cases, already have it in the app's state somewhere. Ideally the app would read it once and make it available in its state, as opposed to different modules calling this function on-demand...\r\n\r\nPR is more of a request for comments.\r\n\r\nGrepping for calls ->\r\n```\r\n22:30 $ git grep \"getBootstrapData(\"\r\nspec/helpers/reducerIndex.ts:const bootstrapData = getBootstrapData();\r\nsrc/SqlLab/actions/sqlLab.js:

compare only error code for oauth2 auth\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nI guess this message \"invalid credentials\" is specific for google oauth2 server (or the one that was used to develop the feature), there is a ([link](https://www.cubebackup.com/docs/faq/invalid-credential-error/#:~:text=This%20error%20usually%20happens%20when,Domain%20and%20Domain%20administrator%20correctly.)) I found that makes me think so. With the change applied it started to work good with [identity server 4](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/), and I guess this comparison makes it impossible for people to use oauth2 right now, for example [here](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/20300#issuecomment-2239175914).\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nThis is how it looks with the change

INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThere is an example of how I configured oauth2 for trino. \r\nP.S.: I didn't copy other configuration except for the part need to make oauth work.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfigOverrides:\r\n

\"secret\": os.getenv(\"SUPERSET_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET\"),\r\n        \"scope\": \"openid email profile offline_access trino\",\r\n        \"redirect_uri\":

Typescript v5\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nRefactor the whole `superset-frontend` codebase to be compatible with Typescript v5. Most changes are simply casting index key to proper signature, i.e. `a as keyof typeof B` and defining Record types. However, there are a few hard roadblocks that I had to rely on `//@ts-ignore` to bypass; I have added explanation for each of them.\r\n\r\nSanity testing from 1st glance looks OK\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07455081-c451-49a5-bdff-566ec1ef7cfe\" />\r\n<img width=\"1512\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca3793f6-4a8e-4892-8f78-18c90174e407\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

Superset 5.0\r\nRemoves the following endpoints:\r\n- POST `/api/v1/database/csv_metadata`\r\n- POST `/api/v1/database/excel_metadata`\r\n- POST `/api/v1/database/columnar_metadata`\r\n\r\n- POST `/api/v1/database/<id>/csv_upload`\r\n- POST `/api/v1/database/<id>/excel_upload`\r\n- POST `/api/v1/database/<id>/columnar_upload`\r\n\r\nAnd adds the following generic endpoints:\r\n- POST `/api/v1/database/upload_metadata`\r\n- POST `/api/v1/database/<id>/upload`\r\n\r\nRemoves the following permissions:\r\n`can csv upload on Database`\r\n`can excel upload on Database`\r\n`can columnar upload on Database`\r\n\r\nAnd adds the following permission: `can upload on Database` \r\n\r\nIncludes a db migration that should run fast, depending on the number of roles that include the `can <file-type> upload on Database` permission.\r\nUpgrade and downgrade were tested, but be aware that we loose granularity when downgrading, since we are converging 3 permissions into 1, the downgrade will always expand the final permission into 3 permissions.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!---

SUMMARY\r\nThe `get_all_table_names_in_schema` and `get_all_view_names_in_schema` methods might return data from cache (if `force` isn't set to `True`). Metadata is serialized before getting cached, so currently if cached results are returned, the logic would throw an error as it would try to access these as `DatasourceName` named tuples directly.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic so that the result of these methods are then loaded as `DatasourceName`s, so that cached results can be used properly.\r\n\r\nI also added the catalog name to the `schema_list` cache key.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\nAn error is displayed when trying to load cached table list:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33a78164-ba53-42c0-8e43-5ae4f7f4e4d0)\r\n\r\n\r\n**After**\r\nList loads properly.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Create a DB connection.\r\n2. Set a cache timeout for table metadata.\r\n3. Load tables from a schema.\r\n4. Refresh the browser.\r\n5. The list should load properly.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ]

write the PR title following the conventions at https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/\r\nExample:\r\nfix(dashboard): load charts correctly\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### SUMMARY\r\nPreviously, when passing `viz_type` via the API, it would default to table. This change allows us to send viz_type and have the charts respect it in the UI\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nMake an API request via python and send the following params\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nparams = {\r\n        \"viz_type\": \"big_number\",\r\n        \"groupby\": columns,\r\n        \"metrics\": metrics,\r\n        \"adhoc_filters\": [\r\n            {\r\n                \"expressionType\": \"SQL\",\r\n                \"sqlExpression\": where_clause,\r\n                \"clause\": \"WHERE\",\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe resulting chart would always be a table. No longer\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the `form_data_key` was created, it was used to share state between Superset users and required a secure key length. When permalinks were introduced, the `form_data_key` role changed to only be used for holding and transferring temporary state for a user session and not more for sharing state between Superset users. This PR reduces the `form_data_key` length given that an 8 bytes key is sufficient for its new role.\r\n\r\nAs an example, this will be the diff:\r\n\r\n```\r\nform_data_key=yjxRBK8zEhgHTs2PhFKLpA3gja9yxkBRdVPP4xRtLFO2fipTttSpFjZEbizBbyhm\r\n\r\nform_data_key=z6OiPvci1q0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI should be

change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nPreviously, when importing a report in Superset, charts and datasets were not being overwritten, unlike when they were imported separately. \r\n\r\nThis update fixes the issue by ensuring the overwrite parameter is correctly passed to the import_database, import_dataset, and import_chart functions. Now, when importing a report, charts and datasets will be properly updated, eliminating the need for manual re-importing.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, query_context handling in slice.py has been improved to correctly pass the datasource to QueryContextFactory.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

`JOIN`](https://old.docs.firebolt.io/working-with-semi-structured-data/working-with-arrays.html#unnest), while [in the newer Firebolt it's a

at https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31590 and bringing what's atomically committable out of there.\n\nThis simply adds eslint checks to pre-commit. Note that:\n- it requires having run `npm i` in superset-frontend\n- it's set up to NOT run in CI as part of the pre-commit validation workflow, since we run eslint more formally in another workflow\n\nWhy doing this? Currently it's common to forget to run `npm run lint` prior to committing/pushing, so people can waste time waiting for CI to fail where it could be caught easily. It's nice to have pre-commit do the check itself because it will only evaluate the files that have changed, making it much faster than running a full lint run against all files.\n\n","created_at":"2025-01-14T20:57:43Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T22:18:11Z","closed_at":"2025-01-14T22:18:09Z","merged_at":"2025-01-14T22:18:09Z","merge_commit_sha":"4bad1a258fc06d2f447437ede4e1f4f061b19f20","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"betodealmeida","id":1534870,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MzQ4NzA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1534870?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida","html_url":"https://github.com/betodealmeida","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/betodealmeida/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"craig-rueda","id":2595291,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1OTUyOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2595291?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda","html_url":"https://github.com/craig-rueda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/craig-rueda/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"dpgaspar","id":4025227,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQwMjUyMjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4025227?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar","html_url":"https://github.com/dpgaspar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dpgaspar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eschutho","id":5186919,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxODY5MTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5186919?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho","html_url":"https://github.com/eschutho","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eschutho/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nytai","id":10255196,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjU1MTk2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10255196?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai","html_url":"https://github.com/nytai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nytai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login"

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR does the following:\r\n- Remove the `THUMBNAILS_SELENIUM_USER` config parameter. To execute as a fixed user you can now use the new `FixedUser` executor that can assume the role of any user. This means you can use a different fixed user for thumbnails and Alerts & Reports if necessary.\r\n- Rename `ALERT_REPORTS_EXECUTE_AS` and `THUMBNAILS_EXECUTE_AS` to `ALERT_REPORTS_EXECUTORS` and `THUMBNAILS_EXECUTORS` for improved clarity.\r\n- Add `CACHE_WARMUP_EXECUTORS` to make it possible to specify executors for cache warmup tasks. With this change all async tasks can be configured to use arbitrary executors, similar to what was already possible for Thumbnails and Alerts & Reports.\r\n- Change the cache warmup strategy interface to have a `get_tasks` method instead of `get_payloads`. This change is needed as the cache warmup tasks now need to provide a username to execute the cache warmup tasks.\r\n- Update docs to reflect the changes.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

accepted because they don't want to burden of maintaining it. This PR adds the dialect to Superset directly, registering it in `sqlglot` so it can be used when Superset connects to a Firebolt database.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR integrates Keycloak authentication into Superset. The changes include:\r\n- Modification of configuration files in `docker/pythonpath_dev/` (i.e. `superset_config.py` and `keycloak_security_manager.py`) to support Keycloak integration.\r\n- Implementation of Single Logout (SLO) by retrieving the ID token after authentication and using it during logout.\r\n- Adjustment of new user role assignment: Instead of hardcoding the role to \"Gamma\", new users are now assigned the role defined in the environment variable `AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION_ROLE`. This allows production settings (e.g., setting `AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION_ROLE=Admin`) to be used without changing code.\r\n- Updates to various Docker Compose manifests (`docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose-non-dev.yml`, and `docker-compose-image-tag.yml`) and the `.env` file to properly reflect the changes for production deployment.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n_N/A (no UI changes)_\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Run `pre-commit run --all-files` locally to ensure no linting or type-check errors occur.\r\n2. Using the development environment:\r\n   - Spin up the Superset stack via `docker-compose -f docker-compose-image-tag.yml up -d`.\r\n   - Authenticate through Keycloak and verify that:\r\n     - Upon first login, the new user is created with the role defined in the `AUTH_USER_REGISTRATION_ROLE` environment variable.\r\n     - The ID token is correctly stored in the session and used during logout.\r\n     - Logout correctly logs the user out on both Superset and Keycloak (i.e., the session is cleared).\r\n3. Verify logs and check that the application behaves as expected regarding role assignment and logout flow.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue: _<if applicable, include issue reference, e.g., Fixes #123>_\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags: _None_\r\n- [ ] Changes UI: _No_\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351)):\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API: _Yes – Keycloak integration with Single Logout and configurable role assignment_\r\n- [ ] Removes

#31344\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis PR fixes a bug where the \"Undo\" button displays actions from a previously edited dashboard after switching to a new one. The issue occurred because the dashboardLayout.past array, which stores the undo history, was not cleared when switching between dashboards or entering edit mode.\r\n\r\n## BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n### Before\r\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ddAJXwsBFAmTHtpjKqo-fRAzk6fu4aek/view?usp=sharing](url)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fvomN09d4G_87We-YfOaAurMTTcQ7dAO/view?usp=sharing](url)\r\n## Key Changes:\r\nReset Dashboard History:\r\n\r\nIntroduced the resetDashboardPast function to ensure the dashboardLayout.past array is cleared when toggling edit mode.\r\nEdit Button Update:\r\n\r\nUpdated the \"Edit Dashboard\" button to call the resetDashboardPast function via boundActionCreators.clearDashboardHistory() when clicked.\r\n\r\n## Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\n- Navigate to a dashboard (Dashboard A).\r\n- Click \"Edit\" and make changes. Save the dashboard.\r\n- Navigate to the dashboard list and select another dashboard (Dashboard B).\r\n- Click \"Edit\" on Dashboard B.\r\n- Press the \"Undo\" button.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior:\r\n\r\n- The undo button should be disabled when first editing Dashboard B.\r\n- Undo actions should not reflect changes made in Dashboard A.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-12T17:35:56Z","updated_at":"2025-01-22T10:39:41Z","closed_at":"2025-01-21T19:23:28Z","merged_at":"2025-01-21T19:23:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"4417e6eaefbb4c81385580fdf17e72852babc903","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"rusackas","id":812905,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMjkwNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/812905?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas","html_url":"https://github.com/rusackas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rusackas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"justinpark","id":1392866,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzOTI4NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1392866?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark","html_url":"https://github.com/justinpark","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/justinpark/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"kgabryje","id":15073128,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MDczMTI4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15073128?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje","html_url":"https://github.com/kgabryje","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/kgabryje/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"geido","id":60598000,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwNTk4MDAw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/60598000?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido","html_url":"https://github.com/geido","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/geido/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1330950144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMwOTUwMTQ0","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/S","name":"size/S","color":"C8B6FF","default":false,"description":""},{"id":2625458401,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjI1NDU4NDAx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/dashboard:editmode","name":"dashboard:editmode","color":"3CC4E6","default":false,"description":"Related

SUMMARY\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/29953 removed the CSRF requirement for endpoints used to download a dashboard as PNG/PDF, so that these work in embedded mode.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the FF validation logic for these endpoints from using `before_request` to a new decorator, as `before_request` was causing issues to the `WTF_CSRF_EXEMPT_LIST` config.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nNo UI changes.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Have async dashboard screenshot download configured.\r\n2. Access an embedded dashboard and validate that the PDF download works.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you

docs is difficult and error-prone. Some of the challenges include:\r\n- having a reproducible deterministic setup (version of python that matches CI)\r\n- switching to a different `superset_config`\r\n- requires a local postgres\r\n- database state from previous branch can interfere in and out of a cypress setup (different set of examples, database migrations might be in a different checkpoint, ...)\r\n- switching to a different port\r\n- having celery workers working\r\n- caching is nice to have to accelerate tests, which may or may not be set up\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nGiven this, I thought I'd just make it such that you can just `CYPRESS_CONFIG=true docker compose up` to fire up a backend against which you can run cypress tests locally. Given the reference to `CYPRESS_CONFIG` in our docker-compose.yml and in various `docker/`-related scripts, it looks like either it was supported in the past, or someone tried to do work in this direction, but clearly isn't working today as is.\r\n\r\nTo get this working here I'm:\r\n- setting up `CYPRESS_CONFIG=true` to point to a dedicated database schema `superset_cypress`, this gets created on Postgres first-boot, and currently will require deleting the docker volume for Postgres to take effect\r\n- starting up superset app to run on `8081`, which seems to be the default port assumption for Cypress runs\r\n- pointing to the config file at `tests/integration_tests/superset_test_config.py`, which is need for tests, eventually might want to merge this into `docker/pythonpath/superset_config.py` for simplicity. For now I conditionally import it\r\n- removing duplicate docs entry existing in both `docs/docs/contributing/development.mdx` and `docs/docs/contributing/howtos.mdx`\r\n- adjusting docs\r\n\r\n## addressing current issues \r\n\r\nI won't lie getting this back on track feels like wacking a machete through the jungle. Borderline disrepair territory. Turns out probably no one has been running tests locally for a while cause the setup was broken

SUMMARY\r\nFollow-up of https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/31791, this PR re-enables skipped integration tests that still make sense and removes the ones that supported legacy assets.\r\n\r\nSome tests continue to be skipped as we don't have the required fixtures to run them. They will probably be removed in the future as more legacy charts are removed.\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\nCI should be sufficient.\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [ ] Has associated issue:\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [ ] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration

SUMMARY\r\nFixes #25592\r\n\r\nAdded clearing of popoverLabel and hasCustomLabel states. Merged handlers that works with toggle/close from props and locally implemented in component to work with new column selectors and edit existing ones.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nAfter:\r\n<img width=\"661\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-10 о 18 27 31\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1439783f-561f-4919-8754-8d57cd6a44b9\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. On the chart table agregattion edit page\r\n2. Add new column with custom title\r\n3. Open new popover to add column\r\n4. Check that column name in popover is default ('My Column')\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: #25592\r\n- [ ] Required feature flags:\r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [ ] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n\r\n<!-- Korbit AI PR Description Start -->\r\n## Description by Korbit AI\r\n\r\n### What change is being made?\r\n\r\nRefactor the `handleTogglePopover` and `handleClosePopover` functions to better accommodate controlled components within `ColumnSelectPopoverTrigger`.\r\n\r\n### Why are these changes being made?\r\n\r\nThe changes ensure that `ColumnSelectPopoverTrigger` handles both controlled and uncontrolled component cases by delegating toggle and close functionality to external handlers when needed, enhancing flexibility and ensuring consistent behavior across different component states. This approach also consolidates logic, making maintenance easier, though it introduces dependency on the existence of externally provided handlers for controlled components.\r\n\r\n> Is this description stale?

I think self.type is not native type of the column, here we should pass tal_column. type, which is \"IPADDR\" in my case.\r\n```\r\nclass UUID(sqltypes.BINARY):\r\n    __visit_name__ = \"UUID\"\r\n\r\n    def literal_processor(self, dialect):\r\n        def process(value):\r\n            if value is not None:\r\n                value = f'uuid(\"{value}\")'\r\n            return value\r\n\r\n        return process\r\n```\r\nAfter I modify this, I successfully processed data types by literal_processor while using filters.

This approach ensures that personal tokens remain valid according to the latest configuration, enhancing security and maintaining updated permissions.\n\n> Is this description stale?

ports and cypress project id\n\n<!-- Korbit AI PR Description Start -->\n## Description by Korbit AI\n\n### What change is being made?\nUpdate the port mappings in `docker-compose.yml` for the Nginx and app services and adjust the project ID and base URL in `cypress.config.ts`.\n\n### Why are these changes being made?\nThese changes are being made to accommodate a port conflict and ensure the app runs on non-default ports, preventing interference with services using port 80 and 8088. The updates in the Cypress configuration, including the project ID and base URL, reflect these new settings, ensuring integration tests still target the correct addresses.\n\n> Is this description stale?

The added test ensures that the pivot functionality correctly handles and aggregates data with complex indexing structures, improving robustness and reliability.\n\n> Is this description stale?
