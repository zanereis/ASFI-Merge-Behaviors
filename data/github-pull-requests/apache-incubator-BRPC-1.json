What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/issues/189\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\nbthread需要额外适配ASan，不然会导致ASan误报。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n1. 在bthread创建、切换、销毁时，让ASan知道当前bthread的栈信息，主要用于维护[fake stack](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerUseAfterReturn)。\r\n2. 主动对对象池中的内存进行下毒/消毒：get_object时消毒、return_object下毒，可以排查出对象被归还之后还继续被使用的问题。此外，ExecutionQueue的cancel功能在设计上允许TaskNode被归还到对象池后还能继续被使用，所以支持通过ObjectPoolWithASanPoison模板对象来禁用下毒/消毒功能。\r\n3. 修复ASan发现的一些内存问题。\r\n4. 增加一个启用ASan的UT CI。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: resolve #2874\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\nGFLAGS_NS的作用是兼容gflags不同版本的不同namespace，应该是gflags 2.0前后发生了变化。目前GFLAGS_NS是在编译bRPC库的时候动态生成的。如果GFLAGS_NS出现在用户使用的头文件中，就要求用户也要定义GFLAGS_NS，否则就会编译失败。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n1. 目前bRPC库要求gflags版本大于2.1，没有namespace兼容性问题，使用gflags库的GFLAGS_NAMESPACE替代GFLAGS_NS即可。\r\n2. bthread、butil目录中的注册检验器的逻辑（除了string的检验器）使用BUTIL_VALIDATE_GFLAG代替。\r\n3. GFLAGS_NS涉及的范围比较广，一次性改完的话，改动比较大。所以先改src和test目录，等这个PR合了之后，再改tool和example目录。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n###

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #2825\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\nThe issue pertains to incorrectly tracking and emitting metric names when dumping Prometheus metrics. Some metrics, especially those related to latency, were not being properly emitted due to incorrect handling of the `emitted_metrics` set.\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n- Fixed the logic for tracking emitted metrics by using a set to ensure that duplicate metrics are not emitted.\r\n- Ensured that all necessary latency percentiles and summary metrics are properly output, with correct handling of the `_latency_*` and `_count` suffixes.\r\n- Added a mechanism to track previously emitted metric names to prevent duplication in Prometheus output.\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- **Performance effects**: The introduction of a set to track emitted metrics could slightly impact performance, but this change ensures more efficient handling of duplicate metrics.\r\n- **Breaking backward compatibility**: No breaking changes; existing behavior should remain intact except for the fix to prevent duplicate metric emission.\r\n","created_at":"2025-01-13T09:02:28Z","updated_at":"2025-01-14T03:51:54Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6ada0eca540f8894fd46ed798edcef31c076fdc8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2870/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2870/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/2870/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/statuses/a0507d6c9cfa62ac8c7f196788d7a2d6e6dcf9ea","head":{"label":"snehavats1404:fix/metric-emission-tracking","ref":"fix/metric-emission-tracking","sha":"a0507d6c9cfa62ac8c7f196788d7a2d6e6dcf9ea","user":{"login":"snehavats1404","id":173487014,"node_id":"U_kgDOClczpg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173487014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404","html_url":"https://github.com/snehavats1404","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":908242484,"node_id":"R_kgDONiKuNA","name":"brpc","full_name":"snehavats1404/brpc","private":false,"owner":{"login":"snehavats1404","id":173487014,"node_id":"U_kgDOClczpg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173487014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404","html_url":"https://github.com/snehavats1404","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/snehavats1404/brpc","description":"brpc

This change improves accuracy and robustness by switching to /proc/self/cmdline and normalizing the command names.\r\n\r\nWhat is changed and the side effects?\r\nChanged: Replaced /proc/self/stat with /proc/self/cmdline in the read_command_name function.\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n-Performance effects (性能影响): Minimal impact; reading from /proc/self/cmdline is comparable in performance to reading from /proc/self/stat.\r\n-Breaking backward compatibility (向后兼容性): No known breaking changes; the function behavior is expected to improve without impacting existing functionality.","created_at":"2025-01-13T07:22:49Z","updated_at":"2025-01-13T08:08:34Z","closed_at":"2025-01-13T08:08:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4059e99804a1d9276f35290a00201295cf7834e1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2869/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2869/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/2869/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/statuses/5a669dead5b0303d5a7b637002aa82785e035c45","head":{"label":"snehavats1404:bugfix/command-name-trunc-#1251","ref":"bugfix/command-name-trunc-#1251","sha":"5a669dead5b0303d5a7b637002aa82785e035c45","user":{"login":"snehavats1404","id":173487014,"node_id":"U_kgDOClczpg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173487014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404","html_url":"https://github.com/snehavats1404","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":908242484,"node_id":"R_kgDONiKuNA","name":"brpc","full_name":"snehavats1404/brpc","private":false,"owner":{"login":"snehavats1404","id":173487014,"node_id":"U_kgDOClczpg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/173487014?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404","html_url":"https://github.com/snehavats1404","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/snehavats1404/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/snehavats1404/brpc","description":"brpc

Description\r\n\r\n- Updated the `read_command_name` function to improve command name handling by using `/proc/self/cmdline` instead of `/proc/self/stat`.  \r\n- Normalizes command names by removing unnecessary parentheses.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n1. Replaced `/proc/self/stat` with `/proc/self/cmdline` in `read_command_name`.\r\n2. Added normalization logic to handle edge cases for command names.\r\n3. Validates:\r\n   - Normal command names.\r\n   - Command names with parentheses.\r\n   - Edge cases like empty or malformed input.\r\n   - Command line with arguments.\r\n\r\n## Related

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\ngolang mutex的演进中有两点优化：\r\n\r\n1. fast path没抢到锁的竞争者，进入slow path之后，立即再抢一次锁，不成功就阻塞在butex中，等下次唤醒在抢锁。进入slow path之后的第一次抢锁大概率是会失败的。[[1]](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/edcad8639a902741dc49f77d000ed62b0cc6956f)\r\n2. 被唤醒的队头竞争者跟新竞争者抢锁，大概率也是会失败。因为新竞争者占用着cpu且数量很多。如果将队头的竞争者放到队尾，显然不公平，甚至可能出现饥饿问题。[[2]](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/0556e26273f704db73df9e7c4c3d2e8434dec7be)\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n1. 进入slow path之后，如果worker线程本地调度队列为空，尝试自旋4次再抢锁，这对于临界区小的场景是有意义的。\r\n2. 被唤醒的队头竞争者抢锁失败后，会被重新放回队头。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of

leak，需MALLOC_CONF=\"prof:true,prof_leak:true,prof_final:true\"，进程退出时生成heap文件\r\n\r\n注：每次dump的都是从采样至今的所有数据，除非reset，接来下dump的是从reset至今的所有数据，方便做diff。\r\n\r\n样例：\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41f48ea5-ed52-4498-8b56-be6abdae29a2)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82d10c80-b9ee-45c2-9983-ef76e936a4af)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8031492-447a-4896-8628-949458ebef6d)\r\n\r\n\r\nSide

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/brpc/issues/2542\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n升级到1.10.0版本后，重复解析两次 gflags 后，flags bthread_concurrency_by_tag validate会报错的问题又复现了。\r\n是由于在默认配置下，第二次解析gflags时，num = 0，tag_ngroup = FALGS_bthread_concurrency。两者不想等导致返回了EPERM。\r\ngflags的默认配置下，只有一个tag且等于0，bthread_concurrency_by_tag的默认值应该设置成等于bthread_concurrency的默认值，这样也比较合理。\r\n![6M4`0}5K%XVK@V@0(DNK71K](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73ddc063-546c-49aa-abdc-11b7fa727311)\r\n\r\n###

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: resolve #2726 \r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n#2692 未使用`__dl_sym`的原因是，UT无法运行，报错信息：`symbol lookup error: ./libbrpc.so: undefined symbol: pthread_mutex_trylock`。相关issue：#2266 #1086 。\r\n\r\n报错原因总结：`libpthread.so`先于`libbrpc.dbg.so`加载，导致使用`__dl_sym RTLD_NEXT`在后续加载的动态库中找不到`pthread_mutex_trylock`符号。\r\n\r\n解决方法有两个：\r\n1. `libbrpc.dbg.so`先于`libpthread.so`加载。\r\n2. 最终的可执行文件静态链接bRPC静态库。\r\n\r\n具体分析：\r\n\r\n[man文档](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/dlsym.3.html)提到`RTLD_NEXT`的作用：\r\n\r\n> Find the next occurrence of the desired symbol in the search order after the current object.\r\n\r\n在本场景下，大致意思是在从加载顺序在`libbrpc.dbg.so`之后的动态库中查找`pthread_mutex_*`符号。那么，`libbrpc.dbg.so`要先于`libpthread.so`加载，才能找到`pthread_mutex_*`系列符号。\r\n\r\n在master分支下编译出brpc_channel_unittest程序用作调试。为了更好地展示，会对输出进行适当的处理（过滤、删减）。\r\n\r\n通过`LD_DEBUG=libs`查看动态库加载顺序，发现`libpthread.so`先于`libbrpc.dbg.so`加载了。\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nLD_DEBUG=libs

error: undefined symbol: pthread_mutex_trylock (fatal)\r\n```\r\n\r\n所以，此时`sys_pthread_mutex_trylock`是`NULL`。UT之所以没有crash，应该是所有UT以及依赖的库都没用`pthread_mutex_trylock`。\r\n\r\n另一方面，没有`pthread_mutex_lock`和`pthread_mutex_unlock`相关的报错，换而言之，它们的符号是能被找到的。那么，这两个符号来自于哪里呢？\r\n\r\n增加一行代码，方便识别出`pthread_mutex_lock`和`pthread_mutex_unlock`符号的相关绑定信息。\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nstatic void init_sys_mutex_lock() {\r\n    if (_dl_sym) {\r\n        sys_pthread_mutex_trylock = (MutexOp)dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \"pthread_mutex_trylock\");\r\n\r\n        sys_pthread_mutex_lock = (MutexOp)_dl_sym(RTLD_NEXT, \"pthread_mutex_lock\", (void*)init_sys_mutex_lock);\r\n        sys_pthread_mutex_unlock = (MutexOp)_dl_sym(RTLD_NEXT, \"pthread_mutex_unlock\", (void*)init_sys_mutex_lock);\r\n\r\n        sys_pthread_mutex_trylock = (MutexOp)dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, \"pthread_mutex_trylock\");\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n通过`LD_DEBUG=bindings,libs`找到了，`pthread_mutex_lock`和`pthread_mutex_unlock`符号来自于`libc.so.6`（两个`pthread_mutex_trylock`报错之间的输出）。\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nLD_DEBUG=bindings,libs ./brpc_channel_unittest \r\n\r\n......\r\n7240:\tcalling init: ./libbrpc.dbg.so\r\n7240:\tbinding file ./libbrpc.dbg.so [0] to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 [0]: normal symbol

`pthread_mutex_unlock'\r\n==================================================\r\n7240:\t./libbrpc.dbg.so: error: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: pthread_mutex_trylock (fatal)\r\n7240:\tbinding file ./libbrpc.dbg.so [0] to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 [0]: normal symbol `pthread_mutex_lock'\r\n7240:\tbinding file ./libbrpc.dbg.so [0] to /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 [0]: normal symbol `pthread_mutex_unlock'\r\n7240:\t./libbrpc.dbg.so: error: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: pthread_mutex_trylock (fatal)\r\n==================================================\r\n```\r\n\r\n在`libc.so.6`搜索`pthread_mutex_*`相关符号，确实没有`pthread_mutex_trylock`的符号。\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnm -D /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep pthread_mutex\r\n\r\n0000000000094480 T pthread_mutex_destroy\r\n00000000000944b0 T pthread_mutex_init\r\n00000000000944e0 T pthread_mutex_lock\r\n0000000000094510 T pthread_mutex_unlock\r\n```\r\n\r\n`libc.so`中的`pthread_mutex_*`相关函数应该是`stub function`，参考[[1](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Porting.html)] [[[2](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11210463)] [[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11161462/why-glibc-and-pthread-library-both-defined-same-apis/11210463#comment17107187_11210463)]。\r\n\r\n> A *stub* function is a function which cannot be implemented on a particular machine or operating system. Stub functions always return an error, and set `errno` to `ENOSYS` (Function not implemented).\r\n\r\n在这个场景下，即使`pthread_mutex_lock`和`pthread_mutex_unlock`使用了错误的函数，`pthread_mutex_trylock`是`NULL`，也不会影响进程运行。因为`libpthread.so`先加载了，这时候进程使用的`pthread_mutex_*`符号都来自于`libpthread.so`，即`libbrpc.dbg.so`的hook失效了。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n1. 使用`__dl_sym`加载`pthread_mutex_try`，规避`malloc`库死锁问题。使用时需要满足以下其中一点：\r\n    1.  `libbrpc.dbg.so`先于`libpthread.so`加载。（UT使用了这个方法）\r\n    2. 最终的可执行文件静态链接bRPC静态库。\r\n2. 对于像#2266 无法修改链接顺序或者无法使用静态库的场景，支持使用`NO_PTHREAD_MUTEX_HOOK`宏关闭`pthread_mutex_*`相关的hook。关闭后，只是contention profiler采集不到`pthread_mutex`的竞争，在可接受范围内。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n-

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number: #2288 中引入用于对齐`Element`地址的`std::aligned_storage`在C++23中已经被废弃了。详细背景见[P1413R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1413r3.pdf)提案。\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n~~C++17起，使用[P1413R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1413r3.pdf)提案中建议的`alignas(T) std::byte element_spaces[sizeof(T)]`来代替`std::aligned_storage`。~~\r\n\r\n1. `butil::AlignedMemory`的实现跟[P1413R3](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1413r3.pdf)提案中建议的`alignas(T) std::byte[sizeof(T)]`类似，优点是封装性更好，所以使用`butil::ManualConstructor`（包含`butil::AlignedMemory`）代替`std::aligned_storage`。\r\n2. `MPSCQueueNode`、`ObjectPool`、`ResourcePool`也需要对齐。\r\n3. 补充了一下`ALIGNAS`宏的一些注释（来自于chromium）。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n- Please make sure your changes are compilable(请确保你的更改可以通过编译).\r\n- When providing us with a new feature, it is best to add related tests(如果你向我们增加一个新的功能, 请添加相关测试).\r\n- Please follow [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](../../master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).(请遵循贡献者准则).\r\n","created_at":"2024-07-30T15:54:21Z","updated_at":"2024-09-26T02:54:11Z","closed_at":"2024-09-26T02:43:19Z","merged_at":"2024-09-26T02:43:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"c727dd77a26aed921b8d7b5fdcb83c22d6f62a02","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2719/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/2719/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/issues/2719/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/brpc/statuses/eb863863932d67aaff9264ff88858e71544b4f06","head":{"label":"chenBright:deprecate_aligned_storage","ref":"deprecate_aligned_storage","sha":"eb863863932d67aaff9264ff88858e71544b4f06","user":{"login":"chenBright","id":12249635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQ5NjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12249635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright","html_url":"https://github.com/chenBright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":505688055,"node_id":"R_kgDOHiQv9w","name":"brpc","full_name":"chenBright/brpc","private":false,"owner":{"login":"chenBright","id":12249635,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMjQ5NjM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12249635?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright","html_url":"https://github.com/chenBright","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/chenBright/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/chenBright/brpc","description":"Industrial-grade

由于原本传入的解析长度是body_size - meta_size，这会导致解析时不止解析了BRPC Message，还会把Attachment也一同解析，出现一些令人困惑的解析结果；\r\n2. 原本的实现方式只支持解析包含单个RPC请求/响应的报文，但实际同一报文中是可能包含多个RPC请求/响应的。\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n修复 #2408 引入的wireshark

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n线程锁临界区内挂起协程（bthread_mutex、sync rpc、bthread_usleep、bthread_yield等），属于未定义行为（大概率会造成死锁）。目前缺少一种发现机制，只能等到出现死锁后查看调用栈再排查。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\nbrpc已经hook了pthread mutex接口，加锁的时候将线程局部变量加一，解锁的时候，将线程局部变量减一。只有在线程局部变量等于0的时候，挂起协程才是安全的，否则，将调用栈打印出来用于排查问题。该调用栈只打印一次，因为一旦出现pthread mutex临界区内挂起协程，线程局部变量已经是错乱的，后续的调用栈已经没有参考价值。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance

What problem does this PR solve?\r\n\r\nIssue Number:\r\n\r\nProblem Summary:\r\n\r\n1. Multi模式下，插入数据发生hash冲突的时候，size没有加一。另一方面，插入数据不能自动扩容。\r\n2. m1 = m2，m1扩容后m1._nbucket不等于m2._nbucket的时候，m1的_buckets上除了插入数据的位置，其他位置没有set_invalid，后续使用会出现内存问题。\r\n3. 扩容时，_buckets和_thumbnail都是先释放再申请新的内存。如果申请失败了，FlatMap就完全不可用了。\r\n\r\n### What is changed and the side effects?\r\n\r\nChanged:\r\n\r\n1. size++。另外，当FlatMap负载超过阈值，则遍历Bucket链表，当存在不同的key的时候，则扩容。否则，不扩容直接插入。因为key一样，扩容后这些数据还是在同一个链表上。\r\n2. 扩容后都要初始化_buckets和_thumbnail数组。\r\n3. 申请内存成功后，再将其复制给_buckets和_thumbnail。一旦出现错误，则先释放已经申请的内存再返回失败。\r\n\r\nSide effects:\r\n- Performance effects(性能影响):\r\n\r\n- Breaking backward compatibility(向后兼容性): \r\n\r\n---\r\n### Check List:\r\n-
