Once the insert execution is delayed due to the scale, the cache loses efficacy. It only works for the last time update per minute, considering our 25s period.\r\n  * Fix ID conflicts for all JDBC storage implementations.

https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/5238 and it never works as expected so I just remove this and won't consider it as breaking change.\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/skywalking/pull/5238 we meant to add `lengthEnvVariable` as an mechanism to override the column length, but the env var it uses is `SW_SLOW_DB_THRESHOLD`, which is the duration threshold instead of length threshold, what's more, the content of `SW_SLOW_DB_THRESHOLD` is something like `default:200,mongodb:100` but `StorageModels` always tries to parse the content of `SW_SLOW_DB_THRESHOLD` as an integer, which causes the following errors \r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-11-12 04:02:25,306 org.apache.skywalking.oap.server.core.storage.model.StorageModels 164 [main] ERROR [] - [9.3.0-SNAPSHOT-7c8867b] Model

it. \r\nFrom mock theory, it should be mocked too, because `KubernetesClient.setDefault();` is in the constructor of KubernetesServices, which is an enum, then it is initialized as always.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, `mockStatic` seems only mocking static method, and there is no static method in it. We just need to inject `INSTANCE` as a member of enum. So, just keeping it in the `PrepareForTest` should be enough.\r\n\r\nMy local tests passed, would try it again on CI too.","created_at":"2022-11-10T14:48:38Z","updated_at":"2022-11-10T15:30:36Z","closed_at":"2022-11-10T15:30:25Z","merged_at":"2022-11-10T15:30:25Z","merge_commit_sha":"f3b52113df698509e2a0ee3996ce81a08064a45f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP

In the previous implementations, most providers have to hold a field/pointer to the configuration, in order to use it in `init`/`start`/... stages. This should be fine until we want to extend and add a new configuration, a new configuration class could inherit from the existing config, but the new provider can't inherit the existing provider, because you can't inject the extended config to replace the config instance created and hold in the old provider.\r\nThrough this new creator interface, the new provider could intercept the config type, and return a new one, and notify the old provider with the new initialized config.","created_at":"2022-10-21T10:30:02Z","updated_at":"2022-10-22T11:07:57Z","closed_at":"2022-10-22T11:07:53Z","merged_at":"2022-10-22T11:07:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"9d3982db74dbe7ba9c028aef674ace13fb74cc18","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":783582051,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3ODM1ODIwNTE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/core%20feature","name":"core feature","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"Core and important feature.

setting the level for MAL metrics, using the service and instance methods for each metric will generate a lot of redundant code.\r\nWe can use MAL's \"expSuffix\" to avoid it, but because the \"expSuffix\" required by the instance level metric and the service level metric is different, it will inevitably lead to file splitting (mysql.yaml -> mysql-instance.yaml + mysql-service.yaml )\r\nSo I changed the loading method of MAL files to be folder based to facilitate future expansion.\r\n\r\nI haven't updated the doc yet because I think maybe somewhere needs to be modified.\r\n\r\n###

think I had been trapped in the thoughts that we need to list all resources (Pods, services, etc.) and recompose them in memory, recently when I am reviewing the codes, I found that we can simply list/fetch the exact resource by just namespace/name.\r\n\r\nIn this patch I improve the logic to fetch the Pod by IP with field selector, this prevents us to listing all Pods and then filter in memory.\r\n\r\nThe usage of other resources can not be improved that much as they don't have suitable filed selector supported for now.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2022-10-17T05:16:08Z","updated_at":"2022-10-18T05:02:28Z","closed_at":"2022-10-18T05:02:07Z","merged_at":"2022-10-18T05:02:07Z","merge_commit_sha":"5abe6ceb1ff0938be917f8b440c5eb3590cf31db","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":830850453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MzA4NTA0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/skywalking/labels/backend","name":"backend","color":"54ceff","default":false,"description":"OAP

is for ALS k8s analyzer.\r\n\r\nPreviously we set up watchers to watch the Kubernetes metadata changes, this is perfect when there are deployments changes and SkyWalking can react to the changes in real time. However when the cluster has many events (such as in large cluster or some special Kubernetes engine like OpenShift), the requests sent from SkyWalking becomes unpredictable, i.e. SkyWalking might send massive requests to Kubernetes API server, causing heavy load to the API server.\r\n\r\nThis PR switches from the watcher mechanism to polling mechanism, SkyWalking polls the metadata in a specified interval, so that the requests sent to API server is predictable (~10 requests every `interval`), and the requests count is constant regardless of the cluster's changes. However with this change SkyWalking can't react to the cluster changes in time, but the delay is acceptable in our case.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n    ⚠️ Please make sure to read this template first, pull requests that don't accord with this template\r\n    maybe closed without notice.\r\n    Texts surrounded by `<` and `>` are meant to be replaced by you, e.g. <framework name>, <issue number>.\r\n    Put an `x` in the `[ ]` to mark the item as CHECKED. `[x]`\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 🐛 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're fixing a bug, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### Fix <bug description or the bug issue number or bug issue link>\r\n- [ ] Add a unit test to verify that the fix works.\r\n- [ ] Explain briefly why the bug exists and how to fix it.\r\n     ==== 🐛 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're fixing a bug, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 📈 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're improving the performance, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### Improve the performance of <class or module or ...>\r\n- [ ] Add a benchmark for the improvement, refer to [the existing ones](https://github.com/apache/skywalking/blob/master/apm-commons/apm-datacarrier/src/test/java/org/apache/skywalking/apm/commons/datacarrier/LinkedArrayBenchmark.java)\r\n- [ ] The benchmark result.\r\n```text\r\n<Paste the benchmark results here>\r\n```\r\n- [ ] Links/URLs to the theory proof or discussion articles/blogs. <links/URLs here>\r\n     ==== 📈 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're improving the performance, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n<!-- ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👇 ====\r\n### <Feature description>\r\n- [ ] If this is non-trivial feature, paste the links/URLs to the design doc.\r\n- [ ] Update the documentation to include this new feature.\r\n- [ ] Tests(including UT, IT, E2E) are added to verify the new feature.\r\n- [ ] If it's UI related, attach the screenshots below.\r\n     ==== 🆕 Remove this line WHEN AND ONLY WHEN you're adding a new feature, follow the checklist 👆 ==== -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] If this pull request closes/resolves/fixes an existing issue, replace the issue number.
