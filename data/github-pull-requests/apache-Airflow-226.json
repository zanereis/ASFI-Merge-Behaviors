type annotations to `AthenaSensor` and `AWSAthenaOperator`. Of note on `AWSAthenaOperator` in particular, I removed `hook` as an attribute, which was always defaulting to `None`. I tried to keep it , but continually ran into errors like this:\r\n\r\n>airflow/providers/amazon/aws/operators/athena.py:122: error: Item \"None\" of \"Optional[AWSAthenaHook]\" has no attribute \"stop_query\"\r\n>                response = self.hook.stop_query(self.query_execution_id)\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to add typing when an attribute starts as `None` and gets set later? Or is the point of these errors that that is not necessary?\r\n\r\nI also intentionally put this into two commits since the `AWSAthenaHook` changes were a little more straightforward. I could pull the operator ones out if need be.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing! Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests.

PR adds [direct impersonation of a service account in Google services](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts#directly_impersonating_a_service_account). Part-of https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/8803\r\n\r\nA few notes summarizing the changes:\r\n- no changes in `GKEStartPodOperator`, `DataflowCreateJavaJobOperator` and `DataflowCreatePythonJobOperator` - as these operators do not use `Credentials` class for authentication\r\n- in case of operators that connect to multiple Google services, all hooks use the same value of `impersonation_chain` (if applicable)\r\n- in case of operators that also communicate with services of other cloud providers, the argument is named `google_impersonation_chain`\r\n- changed `get_credentials_and_project` method of `_CredentialProvider` class so that if `impersonation_chain` argument is used then `project_id` returned is extracted from the e-mail of the impersonated account (`target_principal`). This is for the scenario when impersonated service account is from different project than the account from Connection.\r\n`project_id` will still be overridden if specified in Connection's extras or explicitly in operator's arguments.\r\n- `GCSToS3Operator` was modified so that it no longer derivatives from `GCSListObjectsOperator`\r\n- `impersonation_chain` was moved to be the last argument of hooks (if it was not already) to avoid potentially breaking changes when initializing these hooks with positional arguments\r\n\r\n---\r\nMake sure to mark the boxes below before creating PR:

change implements canceling of the workflows in case some of\r\nthe important (prerequisite) jobs failed - such as static checks\r\nor docs. The scheduled workflow will run periodically and check\r\nif there are no duplicate workflow runs (it will cancel all but\r\nthe most recent one). It will also check for the most recent\r\nones and will cancel them if one of the specified jobs (matched\r\nby regular expression) failed.\r\n\r\nThe scenario that we want to handle here:\r\n\r\n* we want to start tests as soon as possible so that we do not\r\n  have to wait for static checks and doc builds\r\n* on the other hand as soon as one of the \"quicker\" jobs fail\r\n  we want to fail whole workflow so that the workers can be\r\n  freed up for other runs.\r\n\r\nThis has to be done as a scheduled run because forked runs\r\ndo not have permissions to cancel any of the other runs
