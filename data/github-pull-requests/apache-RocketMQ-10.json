href=\"https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/releases\">grpc-protobuf's releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>v1.53.0</h2>\n<h3>New Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>googleapis: Allow user set c2p bootstrap config (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9856\">#9856</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: Add contain and stringMatcher in <code>RouteConfiguration</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9845\">#9845</a>)</li>\n<li>core: Add <code>grpc-previous-rpc-attempts</code> to the initial response metadata (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9686\">#9686</a>)</li>\n<li>servlet: Implement gRPC server as a Servlet (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8596\">#8596</a>)</li>\n<li>authz: Implement static authorization server interceptor (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8934\">#8934</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Examples</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>servlet: Add servlet example (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/8596\">#8596</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Update xds error handling logic.  Specifically:\n<ul>\n<li>When the ads stream is closed only send errors to subscribers that haven't yet gotten results</li>\n<li>Timers to detect missing resources don’t start until the adsStream is ready (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9745\">#9745</a>)</li>\n<li>Call subscriber onError callback when xds client fails to connect to server (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9827\">#9827</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>core: Delay retriable stream master listener close until all sub streams are closed. This fixes the call executor lifecycle and prevents potential <code>RejectedExecutionException</code>. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9754\">#9754</a>)</li>\n<li>core: Free unused <code>MessageProducer</code> in <code>RetriableStream</code> (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9853\">#9853</a>), fixing a Netty buffer memory leak for cancelled RPCs</li>\n<li>api: Fail with <code>NullPointerException</code> when a Metadata.Marshaller returns null bytes (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9781\">#9781</a>). This would previously cause a <code>NullPointerException</code> later during the RPC. Now the return value of the Marshaller is checked immediately, to help find the broken Marshaller</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Disallow duplicate addresses in the RingHashLB. (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9776\">#9776</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: EDS weight sums are allowed up to max unsigned int (was max signed int) (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9765\">#9765</a>)</li>\n<li>xds: Drop xds v2 support (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9760\">#9760</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dependencies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>JUnit upgraded to 4.13.2</li>\n<li>bazel: Dropped support for Bazel 4. We track the two most recent major versions of Bazel, Bazel 5 and 6. Bazel 4 may still work, but we are no longer testing it</li>\n<li>bazel: Include Tomcat annotations dependency for <code>@Generated</code> as used by autovalue (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9762\">#9762</a>). Necessary for building xds and rls on Java 9+</li>\n<li>bazel: Export deps from Maven Central-specific stand-in targets (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/9780\">#9780</a>). Some Maven Central artifacts are a combination of multiple Bazel targets, like grpc-core is composed of //core:inprocess, //core:internal, //core:util, //api. There is a “//core:core_maven” target used by maven_install that uses the other targets. Previously the target used <code>runtime_deps</code> to discourage their use by Bazel users, but that could cause compilation failures from lack of hjars. These targets now use <code>exports</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/cpovirk\"><code>@​cpovirk</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/niloc132\"><code>@​niloc132</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stephenh\"><code>@​stephenh</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/olderwei\"><code>@​olderwei</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pandaapo\"><code>@​pandaapo</code></a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/panxuefeng\"><code>@​panxuefeng</code></a></p>\n<h2>v1.52.1</h2>\n<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>xds: Fix an internal bug in xds resource subscription that might cause xds stream not accepting response update for that resource type entirely.

Which Issue(s) This PR Fixes\r\n\r\nFixes #6971\r\n\r\n### Brief Description\r\n\r\n1. migrate message across env: we switch our system from aws to aliyun , some message still not consumed in aws , we should migrate message from aws to aliyun ==> just use exportMessage and importMessage .\r\n2. fix some wrong message: after deploy some bug , the message format is not correct ==> we can exportMessage with json body --> modify message  body --> importMessasge \r\n3. trace bug in lots of message body  ==> after export message with json/text format  ,we could easily search some keywords to view message detail , such as `grep keyword messageFile ` \r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\n\r\n1. exportMessage: mock broker , fetch some messages and export to file , at the same time

In such cases, the HAProxy's Proxy protocol can be introduced to transparently pass the initial TCP connection information of the client. This allows the server to accurately identify the source of message production and consumption.\r\n\r\n### How Did You Test This Change?\r\nI have applied for a proxy service that supports the transparent transmission of the Proxy Protocol. The client sends requests to the server through this proxy service. The server successfully retrieves the Proxy Protocol data and extracts the client's real IP address from it. The server then sets this IP address in the message's attributes.","created_at":"2023-06-28T03:06:33Z","updated_at":"2024-10-14T22:23:27Z","closed_at":"2023-07-04T10:02:16Z","merged_at":"2023-07-04T10:02:16Z","merge_commit_sha":"00fc42b8be848fc3f5c550cbab007b92f128dc38","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/6958/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/6958/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/6958/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/e1899f0d23454fcd894f180ff33afc33bdcfe063","head":{"label":"dingshuangxi888:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"e1899f0d23454fcd894f180ff33afc33bdcfe063","user":{"login":"dingshuangxi888","id":5010921,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMTA5MjE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5010921?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888","html_url":"https://github.com/dingshuangxi888","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dingshuangxi888/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"5c3bd98e50098caa5ad701d99f4cfffb65e69b3f","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq","description":"Apache

<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n<li>This release <em>adds</em> two methods to the Android flavor of Guava: <code>Invokable.getAnnotatedReturnType()</code> and <code>Parameter.getAnnotatedType()</code>. Those methods do not work under an Android VM; we added them only to help our tests of the Android flavor (since we also run those tests under a JRE). Android VMs tolerate such methods as long as the app does not call them or perform reflection on them, and builds tolerate them because of our new Proguard configurations (discussed below). Thus, we expect no impact to most users. However, we could imagine build problems for users who have set up their own build system for the Android flavor of Guava. Please report any problems so that we can judge how safely we might be able to add other methods to the Android flavor in the future, such as APIs that use Java 8 classes like <code>Stream</code>.
