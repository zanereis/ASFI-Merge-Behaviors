What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis implements a few alter table partition commands using the `SessionCatalog`. In particular:\n\n```\nALTER TABLE ... ADD PARTITION ...\nALTER TABLE ... DROP PARTITION ...\nALTER TABLE ... RENAME PARTITION ... TO ...\n```\n\nThe following operations are not supported, and an `AnalysisException` with a helpful error message will be thrown if the user tries to use them:\n\n```\nALTER TABLE ... EXCHANGE PARTITION ...\nALTER TABLE ... ARCHIVE PARTITION ...\nALTER TABLE ... UNARCHIVE PARTITION ...\nALTER TABLE ... TOUCH ...\nALTER TABLE ... COMPACT ...\nALTER TABLE ... CONCATENATE\nMSCK REPAIR TABLE ...\n```\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`DDLSuite`, `DDLCommandSuite` and `HiveDDLCommandSuite`\n","created_at":"2016-04-06T22:32:45Z","updated_at":"2016-04-13T18:06:46Z","closed_at":"2016-04-12T04:01:38Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"11d1ffcb44d70a766355833c7d51c27819e89768","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12220/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12220/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12220/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e3f08b35efa502f34aabcbba266350e4bfefb0c9","head":{"label":"andrewor14:alter-partition-ddl","ref":"alter-partition-ddl","sha":"e3f08b35efa502f34aabcbba266350e4bfefb0c9","user":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17231517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"andrewor14/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewor14","id":2133137,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMzMxMzc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2133137?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewor14/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewor14/spark","description":"Mirror

patch updates our custom Hive 1.2.1 fork in order to shade Kryo in Hive. This is a blocker for upgrading Spark to use Kryo 3 (see #12076).\n\nThe source for this new fork of Hive can be found at https://github.com/JoshRosen/hive/tree/release-1.2.1-spark2\n\nHere's the complete diff from the official Hive 1.2.1 release: https://github.com/apache/hive/compare/release-1.2.1...JoshRosen:release-1.2.1-spark2\n\nHere's the diff from the sources that @pwendell used to publish the current `1.2.1.spark` release of Hive: https://github.com/pwendell/hive/compare/release-1.2.1-spark...JoshRosen:release-1.2.1-spark2. This diff looks large because his branch used a shell script to rewrite the groupId, whereas I had to commit the groupId changes in order to prevent the find-and-replace from affecting the package names in our relocated Kryo classes: https://github.com/pwendell/hive/compare/release-1.2.1-spark...JoshRosen:release-1.2.1-spark2#diff-6ada9aaec70e069df8f2c34c5519dd1e\n\nUsing these changes, I was able to publish a local version of Hive and verify that this change fixes the test failures which are blocking #12076. Note that this PR will not compile until we complete the review of the Hive POM changes and stage and publish a release.\n\n/cc @vanzin, @steveloughran, and @pwendell for review.\n","created_at":"2016-04-06T20:24:22Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T21:01:04Z","closed_at":"2016-04-08T21:00:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a517e1aa00dab99cc166810c7a23c5a1105d53eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12215/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12215/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12215/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/30eb58d57efeae45a70f9fc11ef384072ef8c462","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:shade-kryo-in-hive","ref":"shade-kryo-in-hive","sha":"30eb58d57efeae45a70f9fc11ef384072ef8c462","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds support for `LEFT ANTI JOIN` to Spark SQL. A `LEFT ANTI JOIN` is the exact opposite of a `LEFT SEMI JOIN` and can be used to identify rows in one dataset that are not in another dataset. Note that `nulls` on the left side of the join cannot match a row on the right hand side of the join; the result is that left anti join will always select a row with a `null` in one or more of its keys.\n\nWe currently add support for the following SQL join syntax:\n\n```\nSELECT   *\nFROM      tbl1 A\n          LEFT ANTI JOIN tbl2 B\n           ON A.Id = B.Id\n```\n\nOr using a dataframe:\n\n```\ntbl1.as(\"a\").join(tbl2.as(\"b\"), $\"a.id\" === $\"b.id\", \"left_anti)\n```\n\nThis PR provides serves as the basis for implementing `NOT EXISTS` and `NOT IN (...)` correlated sub-queries. It would also serve as good basis for implementing an more efficient `EXCEPT` operator.\n\nThe PR has been (losely) based on PR's by both @davies (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10706) and @chenghao-intel (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10563); credit should be given where credit is due.\n\nThis PR adds supports for `LEFT ANTI JOIN` to `BroadcastHashJoin` (including codegeneration), `ShuffledHashJoin` and `BroadcastNestedLoopJoin`. \n### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded tests to `JoinSuite` and ported `ExistenceJoinSuite` from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/10563.\n\ncc @davies @chenghao-intel

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nLIKE <pattern> is commonly used in SHOW TABLES / FUNCTIONS etc DDL. In the pattern, user can use `|` or `*` as wildcards.\n1. Currently, we used `replaceAll()` to replace `*` with `.*`, but the replacement was scattered in several places; I have created an utility method and use it in all the places;\n2. Consistency with Hive: the pattern is case insensitive in Hive and white spaces will be trimmed, but current pattern matching does not do that. For example, suppose we have tables (t1, t2, t3), `SHOW TABLES LIKE ' T* '` will list all the t-tables. Please use Hive to verify it.\n3. Combined with `|`, the result will be sorted. For pattern like `'  B*|a*  '`, it will list the result in a-b order.\n\nI've made some changes to the utility method to make sure we will get the same result as Hive does.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nA new method was created in StringUtil and test cases were added.\n\n@andrewor14

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14427\n\nCurrently we can't persist partitioned data source relations in Hive compatible format. If you want to persist partitioned data source relations into Hive, you will get a SparkSQL specific metastore table that Hive can't read.\n\nWe should add the support to improve compatibility with Hive.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd tests into `SQLQuerySuite`.\n\nAs recently SparkSQL removes the support of native Hive DDL commands, we don't test it with DDL command like that: DESCRIBE testDFTABLE1 PARTITION (c='NW', d='1'). So the partitions are locally

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCountVectorizerModel has a binary toggle param. This PR is to add binary toggle param for estimator CountVectorizer. As discussed in the JIRA, instead of adding a param into CountVerctorizer, I moved the binary param to CountVectorizerParams. Therefore, the estimator inherits the binary param.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdd a new test case, which fits the model with binary flag set to true and then check the trained model's all non-zero counts is set to 1.0.\n\nAll tests in CounterVectorizerSuite.scala are passed.\n","created_at":"2016-04-06T06:23:30Z","updated_at":"2016-04-09T07:59:06Z","closed_at":"2016-04-09T07:59:06Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"026c7bda9ecd67eef5ef1e2774f83eefd3e0c27c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12200/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12200/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12200/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/e693c60e8059976ec179c298453017a486792712","head":{"label":"wangmiao1981:binary_param","ref":"binary_param","sha":"e693c60e8059976ec179c298453017a486792712","user":{"login":"wangmiao1981","id":5033592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5033592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981","html_url":"https://github.com/wangmiao1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":41932153,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MTkzMjE1Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"wangmiao1981/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wangmiao1981","id":5033592,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMzM1OTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5033592?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981","html_url":"https://github.com/wangmiao1981","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wangmiao1981/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wangmiao1981/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nWe have ParserUtils and ParseUtils which are both utility collections for use during the parsing process.\nThose names and what they are used for is very similar so I think we can merge them.\n\nAlso, the original unescapeSQLString method may have a fault. When \"\\u0061\" style character literals are passed to the method, it's not unescaped successfully.\nThis patch fix the bug.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded a new test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n- Refer to the Jira for the problem: jira : https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14400\n- The fix is to check if the process has exited with a non-zero exit code in `hasNext()`. I have moved this and checking of writer thread exception to a separate method.\n## How was this patch tested?\n- Ran a job which had incorrect transform script command and saw that the job fails\n- Existing unit tests for `ScriptTransformationSuite`. Added a new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nI have compared non-reserved list in Antlr3 and Antlr4 one by one as well as all the existing keywords defined in Antlr4, added the missing keywords to the non-reserved keywords list.  If we need to support more syntax, we can add more keywords by then.\n\nAny recommendation for the above is welcome. \n## How was this patch tested?\n\nI manually checked the keywords one by one. Please let me know if there is a better way to test.\n\nAnother thought: I suggest to put all the keywords definition and non-reserved list in order, that will be much easier to check in the future.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, we use java HashMap for HashedRelation if the key could fit within a Long. The java HashMap and CompactBuffer are not memory efficient, the memory used by them is also accounted accurately.\n\nThis PR introduce a LongToUnsafeRowMap (similar to BytesToBytesMap) for better memory efficiency and performance.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUpdated existing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThese test suites were removed while refactoring `HadoopFsRelation` related API. This PR brings them back.\n\nThis PR also fixes two regressions:\n- SPARK-14458, which causes runtime error when saving partitioned tables using `FileFormat` data sources that are not able to infer their own schemata. This bug wasn't detected by any built-in data sources because all of them happen to have schema inference feature.\n- SPARK-14566, which happens to be covered by SPARK-14458 and causes wrong query result or runtime error when\n  - appending a Dataset `ds` to a persisted partitioned data source relation `t`, and\n  - partition columns in `ds` don't all appear after data columns\n## How was this patch tested?\n\n`CommitFailureTestRelationSuite` uses a testing relation that always fails when committing write tasks to test write job cleanup.\n\n`SimpleTextHadoopFsRelationSuite` uses a testing relation to test general `HadoopFsRelation` and `FileFormat` interfaces.\n\nThe two regressions are both covered by existing test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrent, SparkSQL `initCap` is using `toTitleCase` function. However, `UTF8String.toTitleCase` implementation changes only the first letter and just copy the other letters: e.g. sParK --> SParK. This is the correct implementation `toTitleCase`.\n\n```\nhive> select initcap('sParK');\nSpark\n```\n\n```\nscala> sql(\"select initcap('sParK')\").head\nres0: org.apache.spark.sql.Row = [SParK]\n```\n\nThis PR updates the implementation of `initcap` using `toLowerCase` and `toTitleCase`.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nPass the Jenkins tests (including new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently in `PERMISSIVE` and `DROPMALFORMED` modes we log any record that is going to be ignored. This can generate a lot of logs with large datasets. This pr is to log the parts of malformed records and the number of subsequent records for each partition.\nThis adds two options as follows;\n\n```\nsqlContext.read\n  .format(\"csv\")\n  .option(\"mode\", \"COUNTMALFORMED\")\n  .option(\"maxStoredMalformedPerPartition\", 3)\n  .load(\"test.csv\").show\n```\n\nA logging message is;\n\n```\n16/04/05 16:42:12 WARN CSVRelation: # of total

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSeparate out linear algebra as a standalone module without Spark dependency to simplify production deployment. We can call the new module spark-mllib-local, which might contain local models in the future.\n\nThe major issue is to remove dependencies on user-defined types.\nThe package name will be changed from mllib to ml. For example, Vector will be changed from `org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.Vector` to `org.apache.spark.ml.linalg.Vector`. The return vector type in the new ML pipeline will be the one in ML package; however, the existing mllib code will not be touched. As a result, this will potentially break the API. Also, when the vector is loaded from mllib vector by Spark SQL, the vector will automatically converted into the one in ml package.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nWIP\n","created_at":"2016-04-05T07:36:33Z","updated_at":"2016-04-11T22:33:50Z","closed_at":"2016-04-08T08:37:34Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a160e6007efad70f072257f0ba100d141dba4cac","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12172/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12172/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12172/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cb95b0c5194e0d53614c5ae9fd77f110bbd62826","head":{"label":"dbtsai:dbtsai-linear-algebra","ref":"dbtsai-linear-algebra","sha":"cb95b0c5194e0d53614c5ae9fd77f110bbd62826","user":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":34716514,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNDcxNjUxNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"dbtsai/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbtsai","id":1134574,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzQ1NzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1134574?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai","html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbtsai/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbtsai/spark","description":"Mirror

patch aims to simplify our build by removing a number of unnecessary excludes. The individual commit messages describe the changes here in more detail, but there are a few key themes:\n- **Remove many excludes in the root POM:** According to the [Maven documentation](ttps://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Management), \"dependency management takes precedence over dependency mediation\". In many cases, we were both excluding transitive dependencies while also using those dependencies in `spark-core` and pinning those dependencies' versions in the `dependencyManagment` section of our POM.\n  \n  As a rough guideline, I think like we should only exclude dependencies under the following scenarios:\n  - We don't want the dependency at all, in which case we should define a Maven Enforcer rule to ban it.\n  - We want to include _some_ version of the dependency but don't want to explicitly specify a fixed version. For instance, imagine that libraries A and B depend on some dependency C. We might exclude C from library B so that library A's version of C becomes the final effective version.\n  - We want to include the dependency only when certain profiles are enabled, so we ban it from all of our transitive dependencies and explicitly re-add it in a profile.\n- **Remove explicitly-promoted transitive dependencies from Hive POM:** in an early revision of #7191, it looks like we tried to use the `core`-classified version of `hive-exec`, which is published as a thin-JAR which does not bundle third-party dependencies' classes. However, both the regular and classified versions of the dependency share the same effective POM, which, in this case, happens to be the dependency-reduced-POM produced by the Maven shade plugin. As a result, users of the `core`-classified JAR must add direct dependencies on what are logically transitive dependencies of `hive-exec`, so #7191 added several such dependencies in `hive/pom.xml`.\n  \n  However, by the end of #7191 we abandoned the idea of using an existing Hive JAR and chose to republish our own JAR, so this promotion of transitive dependencies is no longer necessary.  As a result, this patch was able to significantly cut down the size of the `hive` POM by removing those direct dependencies. This had the side-effect of exposing a problem where one of our Janino JARs was being pulled to a lower version as a side-effect of this unnecessary dependency promotion.\n- **Use Maven's new wildcard exclude support:** Maven now supports wildcard exclusion patterns, so I used that to simplify the exclusion of `org.ow2.asm` artifacts.\n- **Improve `dev/test-dependencies`:** a bad regex caused the `org.spark-project:hive` JARs to not be listed under `dev/deps`; this is now fixed.\n- **Remove explicit `io.netty` dependency**: we don't seem to need this anymore. I did leave the `dependencyManagement` entry for now in order to prevent an unexpected downgrade.\n\n/cc @srowen @steveloughran @vanzin @pwendell @rxin for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nBecause the concept of partitioning is associated with physical tables, we disable all the supports of partitioned views, which are defined in the following three commands in [Hive DDL Manual](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-Create/Drop/AlterView):\n\n```\nALTER VIEW view DROP [IF EXISTS] PARTITION spec1[, PARTITION spec2, ...];\n\nALTER VIEW view ADD [IF NOT EXISTS] PARTITION spec;\n\nCREATE VIEW [IF NOT EXISTS] [db_name.]view_name [(column_name [COMMENT column_comment], ...) ]\n  [COMMENT view_comment]\n  [TBLPROPERTIES (property_name = property_value, ...)]\n  AS SELECT ...;\n```\n\nAn exception is thrown when users issue any of these three DDL commands.\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded test cases for parsing create view and changed the existing test cases to verify if the exceptions are thrown.\n","created_at":"2016-04-05T05:48:29Z","updated_at":"2016-04-06T06:28:28Z","closed_at":"2016-04-06T05:35:25Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5371910bed30153c38692483e49a5a2aa5304679","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12169/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12169/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12169/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/93e51b4a31c166fd48627575cef856b5d044f9dc","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:viewPartition","ref":"viewPartition","sha":"93e51b4a31c166fd48627575cef856b5d044f9dc","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe EMLDAOptimizer should generally not delete its last checkpoint since that can cause failures when DistributedLDAModel methods are called (if any partitions need to be recovered from the checkpoint).\n\nThis PR adds a \"deleteLastCheckpoint\" option which defaults to false.  This is a change in behavior from Spark 1.6, in that the last checkpoint will not be removed by default.\n\nThis involves adding the deleteLastCheckpoint option to both spark.ml and spark.mllib, and modifying PeriodicCheckpointer to support the option.\n\nThis also:\n- Makes MLlibTestSparkContext extend TempDirectory and set the checkpointDir to tempDir\n- Updates LibSVMRelationSuite because of a name conflict with \"tempDir\" (and fixes a bug where it failed to delete a temp directory)\n- Adds a MIMA exclude for DistributedLDAModel constructor, which is already `private[clustering]`\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded 2 new unit tests to spark.ml LDASuite, which calls into spark.mllib.\n","created_at":"2016-04-05T01:45:22Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T19:23:59Z","closed_at":"2016-04-08T02:50:18Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc1d25a5cc59da60deaadd21c5e020cc97a2401a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12166/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12166/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12166/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/702acabd03b6f20071541563ed89bf52419f4b1f","head":{"label":"jkbradley:emlda-save-checkpoint","ref":"emlda-save-checkpoint","sha":"702acabd03b6f20071541563ed89bf52419f4b1f","user":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":19877817,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTg3NzgxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"jkbradley/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jkbradley","id":5084283,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwODQyODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5084283?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley","html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jkbradley/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jkbradley/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nSuppose a sendMsg function depends on the state of a edge's vertices to send messages, and those Pregel messages update such state. In this scenario, initialMsg will initially enforce the same message on all vertices, effectively removing a custom initialization one may have per vertex.\n\nTo deal with this situation, we must define a dummy initMsg (i.e. None), and all Pregel functions must be modified to handle this type of message. A simpler and less cumbersome solution is to make initMsg and the initialization step in Pregel optional.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nNo new tests were added. Previous functionality was kept.\n","created_at":"2016-04-04T23:08:18Z","updated_at":"2016-04-12T02:12:16Z","closed_at":"2016-04-08T23:43:02Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c176bca2aef4ffea8c06e17b3c9234ffc6514f25","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12159/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12159/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12159/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ea5c15bd01eac741296f6ca829f9495624532528","head":{"label":"adeandrade:pregel-optional-initmessage","ref":"pregel-optional-initmessage","sha":"ea5c15bd01eac741296f6ca829f9495624532528","user":{"login":"adeandrade","id":313191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzE5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/313191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade","html_url":"https://github.com/adeandrade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":47136013,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NzEzNjAxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"adeandrade/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"adeandrade","id":313191,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMzE5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/313191?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade","html_url":"https://github.com/adeandrade","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/adeandrade/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/adeandrade/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nIn spark.ml, GBT and RandomForest expose the trait DecisionTreeModel in the trees method, but they should not since it is a private trait (and not ready to be made public). It will also be more useful to users if we return the concrete types.\n\nThis PR: return concrete types\n\nThe MIMA checks appear to be OK with this change.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR adds preliminary locality support for `FileFormat` data sources by overriding `FileScanRDD.preferredLocations()`. The strategy can be divided into two parts:\n1.  Block location lookup\n   \n   Unlike `HadoopRDD` or `NewHadoopRDD`, `FileScanRDD` doesn't have access to the underlying `InputFormat` or `InputSplit`, and thus can't rely on `InputSplit.getLocations()` to gather locality information. Instead, this PR queries block locations using `FileSystem.getBlockLocations()` after listing all `FileStatus`es in `HDFSFileCatalog` and convert all `FileStatus`es into `LocatedFileStatus`es.\n   \n   Note that although S3/S3A/S3N file systems don't provide valid locality information, their `getLocatedStatus()` implementations don't actually issue remote calls either. So there's no need to special case these file systems.\n2.  Selecting preferred locations\n   \n   For each `FilePartition`, we pick up top 3 locations that containing the most data to be retrieved. This isn't necessarily the best algorithm out there. Further improvements may be brought up in follow-up PRs.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nTested by overriding default `FileSystem` implementation for `file:///` with a mocked one, which returns mocked block locations.\n","created_at":"2016-04-04T16:06:21Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T14:58:04Z","closed_at":"2016-04-20T13:31:47Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"5b9fb90fab3120d115804dac6951ceb90eccd54c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12153/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12153/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12153/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/79beca6ad09df76a39cc1a80eebed378e3b2fffc","head":{"label":"liancheng:spark-14369-locality","ref":"spark-14369-locality","sha":"79beca6ad09df76a39cc1a80eebed378e3b2fffc","user":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17232535,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzMjUzNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"liancheng/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"liancheng","id":230655,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzMDY1NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/230655?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng","html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/liancheng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/liancheng/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe current Spark SQL does not support the `exclusion` clause, which is part of ANSI SQL2003’s `Window` syntax. For example, IBM Netezza fully supports it as shown in the [document web link](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSULQD_7.1.0/com.ibm.nz.dbu.doc/c_dbuser_window_aggregation_family_syntax.html). This PR is to fill the gap. \n##### Introduction\n\nBelow is the ANSI SQL2003’s `Window` syntax:\n\n```\nFUNCTION_NAME(expr) OVER {window_name | (window_specification)}\nwindow_specification ::= [window_name] [partitioning] [ordering] [framing]\npartitioning ::= PARTITION BY value[, value...] [COLLATE collation_name]\nordering ::= ORDER [SIBLINGS] BY rule[, rule...]\nrule ::= {value | position | alias} [ASC | DESC] [NULLS {FIRST | LAST}]\nframing ::= {ROWS | RANGE} {start | between} [exclusion]\nstart ::= {UNBOUNDED PRECEDING | unsigned-integer PRECEDING | CURRENT ROW}\nbetween ::= BETWEEN bound AND bound\nbound ::= {start | UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING | unsigned-integer FOLLOWING}\nexclusion ::= {EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW | EXCLUDE GROUP | EXCLUDE TIES | EXCLUDE NO OTHERS}\n```\n\nExclusion clause can be used to exclude certain rows from the window framing when calculating window aggregation function (e.g. AVG, SUM, MAX, MIN, COUNT, etc)  related to current row. Types of window functions that are not supported are listed below:\n1. Offset functions, such as lead(), lag()\n2. Ranking functions, such as rank(), dense_rank(), percent_rank(), cume_dist, ntile()\n3. Row number function, such as row_number()\n##### Definition\n\n| Syntax | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW | Specifies excluding the current row. |\n| EXCLUDE GROUP | Specifies excluding the current row and all rows that are tied with it. Ties occur when there is a match on the order column or columns. |\n| EXCLUDE NO OTHERS | Specifies not excluding any rows. This value is the default if you specify no exclusion. |\n| EXCLUDE TIES | Specifies excluding all rows that are tied with the current row (peer rows), but retaining the current row. |\n##### Use-case Examples:\n- Let's say you want to find out for every employee, where is his/her salary at compared to the average salary of those within the same department and whose ages are within 5 years younger and older. The query could be: \n\n``` SQL\nSELECT NAME, DEPT_ID, SALARY, AGE, AVG(SALARY) AS AVG_WITHIN_5_YEAR\n    OVER(PARTITION BY DEPT_ID \n         ORDER BY AGE \n         RANGE BETWEEN 5 PRECEDING AND 5 FOLLOWING \n         EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW) \nFROM EMPLOYEE \n```\n- Let's say you want to compare every customer's yearly purchase with other customers' average yearly purchase who are at different age group from the current customer. The query could be: \n\n``` SQL\nSELECT CUST_NAME, AGE, PROD_CATEGORY, YEARLY_PURCHASE, AVG(YEARLY_PURCHASE) \n    OVER(PARTITION BY PROD_CATEGORY \n         ORDER BY AGE \n         RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUND FOLLOWING \n         EXCLUDE GROUP) \nFROM CUSTOMER_PURCHASE_SUM \n```\n##### Implementation\n\n**catalyst.parser.SqlBase.g4**\n- add excludeClause definition and append to each case in windowFrame\n- add excludeType definition for CURRENT ROW,GOUP, TIES, NO OTHERS\n\n**catalyst.parser.AstBuilder.scala**\n- parse excludeClause to generate `ExcludeClause`object to set into `SpecifiedWindowFrame`\n\n**catalyst.expressions.windowExpressions.scala**\n- add `ExcludeClause`and `ExcludeType`\n- add `ExcludeClause`object as a parameter to `SpecifiedWindowFrame`\n- validate EXCLUDE GROUP/TIES requires ordered window frame\n\n**catalyst.analysis.Analyzer.scala**\n- validate exclude clause does not support `RowNumberLike`, `RankLike`and `OffsetWindowFunction`\n\n**execution.Window.scala**\n- implement the exclusion logic in sliding frame, expanding frame, shrinking frame and whole partition frame\n\n**Some Test case examples:**\n**DDL and DML:**\nsql(\"create table table1 (col1 int, col2 int, col3 int)\")\n      sql(\"insert into table1 select 6, 12, 10\")\n      sql(\"insert into table1 select 6, 11, 4\")\n      sql(\"insert into table1 select 6, 13, 11\")\n      sql(\"insert into table1 select 6, 9, 10\")\n      sql(\"insert into table1 select 6, 15, 8\")\n      sql(\"insert into table1 select 6, 10, 1\")\n      sql(\"insert into table1 select 6, 15, 8\")\n      sql(\"insert into table1 select 6, 7, 4\")\n      sql(\"insert into table1 select 6, 7, 8\")\n\n**Queries:**\n\n```\n// sliding frame with exclude current row\nselect col1, col2, col3, sum(col2) \n    over (partition by col1 \n       order by col3 \n       rows between 2 preceding and 2 following \n       exclude current row) \nfrom table1 where col1 = 6\n```\n##### Results\n\n| col1 | col2 | col3 | sum(col2) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | 10 | 1 | 18 |\n| 6 | 11 | 4 | 32 |\n| **6** | **7** | **4** | **51** |\n| 6 | 15 | 8 | 40 |\n| 6 | 15 | 8 | 40 |\n| 6 | 7 | 8 | 51 |\n| 6 | 12 | 10 | 44 |\n| 6 | 9 | 10 | 32 |\n| 6 | 6 | 13 | 11 |\n\nIn this case, for example, if we are looking at the (6, 7, 4) row, the frame around this current row has 5 rows (6, 10, 1), (6,11, 4), **(6, 7, 4)**, (6, 15, 8), (6, 15, 8), including the current row. With the `exclude current row` clause, then the calculation of sum(col2) is on the other 4 rows, which is 10 + 11 + 15 + 15 = 51. \n\n```\n//expanding frame with exclude current row\nselect col1, col2, col3, sum(col2) \n    over (partition by col1 \n            order by col3 \n            rows between unbounded preceding and current row \n            exclude group) \nfrom table1 where col1 = 6\n```\n##### Results\n\n| col1 | col2 | col3 | sum(col2) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 6 | 10 | 1 | null |\n| 6 | 11 | 4 | 10 |\n| **6** | **7** | **4** | **10** |\n| 6 | 15 | 8 | 28 |\n| 6 | 15 | 8 | 28 |\n| 6 | 7 | 8 | 28 |\n| 6 | 12 | 10 | 65 |\n| 6 | 9 | 10 | 65 |\n| 6 | 13 | 11 | 86 |\n\nIn this case, for example, if we are looking at row (6, 7, 4), the frame around this current row has 3 rows (6, 10, 1), (6, 11, 4) and (6, 7, 4). Then, with `exclude group` clause, rows (6, 11, 4) and (6, 7, 4) will be excluded because the values of order-by column `col3` on these 2 rows are the same, thus in the same group. Therefore, the sum(col2) at current frame is 10. \n\nFor testcases are located in hive/execution/**WindowFunctionExcludeSuite.scala**\n#### How was this patch tested?\n1. created unit tests to cover all framing cases, each with different exclude types. \n2. run regtest over catalyst, sql, and hive tests under SQL component.\n","created_at":"2016-04-04T06:09:10Z","updated_at":"2017-10-24T06:52:39Z","closed_at":"2017-10-24T06:52:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f6f3492585573a62108a0ea5a6daea37142ad0c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12147/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12147/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12147/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7dc5519ef18da987a3202cbb7c24d74c5a907b60","head":{"label":"xwu0226:window_exclude","ref":"window_exclude","sha":"7dc5519ef18da987a3202cbb7c24d74c5a907b60","user":{"login":"xwu0226","id":14225992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226","html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42968936,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0Mjk2ODkzNg==","name":"spark","full_name":"xwu0226/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xwu0226","id":14225992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0MjI1OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14225992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226","html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xwu0226/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xwu0226/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThis PR is to provide a native support for DDL `DROP VIEW` and `DROP TABLE`. The PR includes native parsing and native analysis.\n\nBased on the HIVE DDL document for [DROP_VIEW_WEB_LINK](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-\nDropView), `DROP VIEW` is defined as, \n**Syntax:**\n\n``` SQL\nDROP VIEW [IF EXISTS] [db_name.]view_name;\n```\n- to remove metadata for the specified view. \n- illegal to use DROP TABLE on a view.\n- illegal to use DROP VIEW on a table.\n- this command only works in `HiveContext`. In `SQLContext`, we will get an exception. \n\nThis PR also handles `DROP TABLE`. \n**Syntax:**\n\n``` SQL\nDROP TABLE [IF EXISTS] table_name [PURGE];\n```\n- Previously, the `DROP TABLE` command only can drop Hive tables in `HiveContext`. Now, after this PR, this command also can drop temporary table, external table, external data source table in `SQLContext`. \n- In `HiveContext`, we will not issue an exception if the to-be-dropped table does not exist and users did not specify `IF EXISTS`. Instead, we just log an error message. If `IF EXISTS` is specified, we will not issue any error message/exception.  \n- In `SQLContext`, we will issue an exception if the to-be-dropped table does not exist, unless `IF EXISTS` is specified.\n- Data will not be deleted if the tables are `external`, unless table type is `managed_table`. \n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nFor verifying command parsing, added test cases in `spark/sql/hive/HiveDDLCommandSuite.scala`\nFor verifying command analysis, added test cases in `spark/sql/hive/execution/HiveDDLSuite.scala`\n","created_at":"2016-04-04T05:58:30Z","updated_at":"2016-04-10T14:43:03Z","closed_at":"2016-04-10T00:42:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"62edf07e8027292227f8521b203129db2101a32e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12146/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12146/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12146/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/40861a3bcb82448f9a27e8893f1c91d9f23ccbe2","head":{"label":"gatorsmile:dropView","ref":"dropView","sha":"40861a3bcb82448f9a27e8893f1c91d9f23ccbe2","user":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":44710950,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NDcxMDk1MA==","name":"spark","full_name":"gatorsmile/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gatorsmile","id":11567269,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNTY3MjY5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11567269?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile","html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gatorsmile/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gatorsmile/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe `window` function was added to Dataset with [this PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12008).\nThis PR adds the R API for this function.\n\nWith this PR, SQL, Java, and Scala will share the same APIs as in users can use:\n- `window(timeColumn, windowDuration)` \n- `window(timeColumn, windowDuration, slideDuration)` \n- `window(timeColumn, windowDuration, slideDuration, startTime)`\n\nIn Python and R, users can access all APIs above, but in addition they can do\n- In R:\n  `window(timeColumn, windowDuration, startTime=...)`\n\nthat is, they can provide the startTime without providing the `slideDuration`. In this case, we will generate tumbling windows.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nUnit tests + manual tests\n","created_at":"2016-04-04T02:41:53Z","updated_at":"2019-02-03T20:59:04Z","closed_at":"2016-04-06T00:23:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"f018cd74fd142051b58a617d0b3bef8b9f9350c3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12141/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12141/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12141/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/37f013f96a5d55de0342f649990adfdb040682e0","head":{"label":"brkyvz:R-windows","ref":"R-windows","sha":"37f013f96a5d55de0342f649990adfdb040682e0","user":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21919521,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTkxOTUyMQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"brkyvz/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"brkyvz","id":5243515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUyNDM1MTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5243515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz","html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/brkyvz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/brkyvz/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14354\n\nCurrently we create `Expand` operator by specifying projections (`Seq[Seq[Expression]]`) and its output. We allow `Expand` to reuse child operator's attributes and so make its constraints invalid when we change the corresponding values of these attributes (e.g., making them null when doing a roll up). We should let it take name expressions and infer output itself.\n\nThe problem is we re-use child's output as `Expand`s output.  We will create new attributes in `Expand` because `Expand` actually performs multiple projections. However, we let the projections in `Expand` as `Expression` instead of `NamedExpression` and re-use child output attributes. Thus there is a inconsistency between `Expand`'s output attributes and projected values.\n\nThe obvious example for this inconsistency is constraints. Previously `Expand` inherits child's constraints. As we will change child's output values by projections (e.g., set it as null), these constraints bound on child's attributes are not valid.\n\nIn previous PR we just set `Expand`s `validConstraints` to empty to avoid such inconsistency. But as the result, we don't have reliable constraints after `Expand` operator.\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nModified `ConstraintPropagationSuite`.\n","created_at":"2016-04-03T13:39:43Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:33:24Z","closed_at":"2016-10-06T02:42:14Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12138/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/12138/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/12138/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8a18acd6c14c346e409f7da709e7f2d33f6e4662","head":{"label":"viirya:expand-name-expr","ref":"expand-name-expr","sha":"8a18acd6c14c346e409f7da709e7f2d33f6e4662","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nThe `window` function was added to Dataset with [this PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/12008).\nThis PR adds the Python, and SQL, API for this function.\n\nWith this PR, SQL, Java, and Scala will share the same APIs as in users can use:\n- `window(timeColumn, windowDuration)` \n- `window(timeColumn, windowDuration, slideDuration)` \n- `window(timeColumn, windowDuration, slideDuration, startTime)`\n\nIn Python, users can access all APIs above, but in addition they can do\n- In Python:\n  `window(timeColumn, windowDuration,

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently, the weird error messages are issued if we use Hive Context-only operations in SQL Context. \n\nFor example, \n- When calling `Drop Table` in SQL Context, we got the following message:\n\n```\nExpected exception org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.parser.ParseException to be thrown, but java.lang.ClassCastException was thrown.\n```\n- When calling `Script Transform` in SQL Context, we got the message:\n\n```\nassertion failed: No plan for ScriptTransformation [key#9,value#10], cat, [tKey#155,tValue#156], null\n+- LogicalRDD [key#9,value#10], MapPartitionsRDD[3] at beforeAll at BeforeAndAfterAll.scala:187\n```\n\nUpdates:\nBased on the investigation from @hvanhovell , the root cause is `visitChildren`, which is the default implementation. It always returns the result of the last defined context child. After merging the code changes from @hvanhovell , it works! Thank you @hvanhovell !\n#### How was this patch tested?\n\nA few test cases are added. \n\nNot sure if the same issue exist for the other operators/DDL/DML. @hvanhovell

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n1. add `SHOW CREATE TABLE tableIdentifier`  in **SqlBase.g4** file\n2. create a `RunnableCommand` class for `ShowCreateTableCommand`, that invokes `SessionCatalog.generateTableDDL`\n3. add `generateTableDDL` method in `SessionCatalog`and override it in `HiveSessionCatalog`.\n4. `HiveSessionCatalog.generateTableDDL` is to create DDL for metastore tables. and for tempTables in Spark, it may not be quite practical. For now, we throw exception in `SessionCatalog.generateTableDDL`. If the community thinks it is also necessary, we can implement this later. \n5. `HiveSessionCatalog.generateTableDDL` branches out to generate Hive syntax DDL for hive tables, while it is also supposed to branch out to generate DataSource syntax DDL for datasource tables. \n6. Limitation. While the DDL work has been going on, some datasource table features are not supported yet. So the generation of DDL is also limited. For example:\n   If the table is created as`df.write.partitionBy(\"a\").saveAsTable(\"t1\")`, this datasource table will record the partitioning columns in tblproperties of the metastore table. But, when the datasource syntax DDL is generated based on this table, we will lose the partitioning information in the DDL. Similarly for bucketing and skew information. etc. \n7. Some follow-up PRs for TODOs:\n- For some cases, where \"create table\" used to issue warnings and may throw exception instead, show create table need to adjust to it. \n- After datasource table DDL can support partitioning, bucketing, skewing, show create table DDL needs to support.\n- Complete the support of SORTCOLUMNS for bucketing and StorageHandler inforamtion in CatalogTable class, then, we can support \"SORTED BY\", \"SKEWED BY\", \"STORED BY\" clause in showing Hive syntax DDL\n- Support show create table index?\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nunite tests with self-check. run the hive, sql, catalyst sbt tests.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\n\nCurrently we extract Python UDFs into a special logical plan EvaluatePython in analyzer, But EvaluatePython is not part of catalyst, many rules have no knowledge of it , which will break many things (for example, filter push down or column pruning).\n\nWe should treat Python UDFs as normal expressions, until we want to evaluate in physical plan, we could extract them in end of optimizer, or physical plan.\n\nThis PR extract Python UDFs in physical plan.\n\nCloses #10935\n## How was this patch tested?\n\nAdded regression
