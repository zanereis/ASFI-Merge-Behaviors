the `WindowKind` and coder things so that the already existing session\r\nwindowing would work.\r\n\r\nBefore, was getting the following panic when trying to use a session window (\r\nwith a gap time of 5 minutes ):\r\n\r\n```\r\npanic: Unexpected windowing strategy: SES[5m0s]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR still needs some work though -- now the error that I get is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npanic: reflect.StructOf: StructOf does not allow unexported fields\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter diving into the runtime package and doing some debugging, this seems to be coming from the encoder trying to encode a `time.Time` value and choking on the private `zone` struct. I'm at a loss there, as none of the structs in the pipeline I'm working on use `time.Time` ( or use a struct that uses `time.Time` somewhere )\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

discussed in [the Jira ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BEAM-6770),\r\nwe are moving this dependency to be test-only by default and documenting\r\nthat it's the user's responsibility to explicitly declare a dependency on\r\n`zstd-jni` before attempting to read or write .zst files.\r\n\r\n`zstd-jni` is effectively now an optional dependency, even though it won't\r\nbe explicity listed as such in the produced pom. The cost:benefit ratio\r\nof codifying an optional dependency in the build is considered low\r\nat this point.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

JobInfo in JobInvocation's constructor, then require JobInfo to be passed to PortablePipelineRunner.run.\r\n\r\nJobInfo is required by the executable stage, so all portable runners will need to create a JobInfo instance at some point. This PR makes that expectation more explicit. It also prevents the need to pass the job id in two places.\r\n\r\nR: @angoenka, @robertwb \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

current Cassandra source sink is tightly coupled to the Datastax Object Mapper. [This requires users](https://docs.datastax.com/en/developer/java-driver/3.1/manual/object_mapper/) of the sink to provide a POJO describing  the table in Cassandra. Although the POJO is a easy and powerful way to describe the table it does requires users to always recompile the pipeline for each change in the table definition. \r\n\r\nI suggest adding a abstraction layer that allows users to inject their own mapper implementation. One example use would be a mapper that works with a generic [Row](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.4.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/values/Row.html) implementation rather than a compile-time POJO. \r\n\r\nThis abstraction layer could be implemented by simply supplying a MapperFactory through the Sink/Source builder. \r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

PR is for improving the error messages that appear when forgetting to register a type with Beam before beginning pipeline construction. A specific focus was improving the user experience for when users forget to register Protobuf types.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that I also updated all the other error messages in the affected files so that they would be roughly consistent and also improved. Mainly this consisted of including information about the input parameters so the user can see what coders/types/etc. are failing to serialize or deserialize.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!
