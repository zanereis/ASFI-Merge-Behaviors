These can usually be remedied by changing configuration parameters (e.g., `spark.rpc.message.maxSize`), but it is much more convenient to change the level of parallelization used during `RDD` creation. This option is available in `sparkContext.broadcast`. This pull request exposes it to `sparkSession.createDataFrame`. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI have been using a patch implementing this change for a while. I'm only exposing a keyword argument used by an underlying function to the user.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-09T20:39:08Z","updated_at":"2017-06-08T10:18:01Z","closed_at":"2017-06-08T10:18:01Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7b9c4454176ac954d77f237a0bb627871226547a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17926/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17926/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17926/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4a9d58d03ed945da17823c85e22d787287c6c21e","head":{"label":"patrick-nicholson:master","ref":"master","sha":"4a9d58d03ed945da17823c85e22d787287c6c21e","user":{"login":"patrick-nicholson","id":7896723,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc4OTY3MjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7896723?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson","html_url":"https://github.com/patrick-nicholson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/patrick-nicholson/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"ac1ab6b9db188ac54c745558d57dd0a031d0b162","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSince [SPARK-2883](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-2883), Apache Spark supports Apache ORC inside `sql/hive` module with Hive dependency. This issue aims to add a new and faster ORC data source inside `sql/core` and to replace the old ORC data source eventually. In this issue, the latest [Apache ORC 1.4.0](https://orc.apache.org/news/2017/05/08/ORC-1.4.0/) (released yesterday) is used.\r\n\r\nThere are four key benefits.\r\n\r\n- **Speed**: Use both Spark `ColumnarBatch` and ORC `RowBatch` together. This is faster than the current implementation in Spark.\r\n- **Stability**: Apache ORC 1.4.0 has many fixes and we can depend on ORC community more.\r\n- **Usability**: User can use `ORC` data sources without hive module, i.e, `-Phive`.\r\n- **Maintainability**: Reduce the Hive dependency and can remove old legacy code later.\r\n\r\nThe followings are two examples of comparisons in `OrcReadBenchmark.scala`.\r\n```\r\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_131-b11 on Mac OS X 10.12.4\r\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-3615QM CPU @ 2.30GHz\r\n\r\nSQL Single Int Column Scan:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOne of the common usability problems around reading data in spark (particularly CSV) is that there can often be a conflict between different readers in the classpath.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if someone launches a 2.x spark shell with the spark-csv package in the classpath, Spark currently fails in an extremely unfriendly way (see databricks/spark-csv#367):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/spark-shell --packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.11:1.5.0\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.csv(\"/foo/bar.csv\")\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Multiple sources found for csv (org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.csv.CSVFileFormat, com.databricks.spark.csv.DefaultSource15), please specify the fully qualified class name.\r\n  at scala.sys.package$.error(package.scala:27)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource$.lookupDataSource(DataSource.scala:574)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.providingClass$lzycompute(DataSource.scala:85)\r\n  at

org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.csv(DataFrameReader.scala:412)\r\n  ... 48 elided\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes a simple way of fixing this error by picking up the internal datasource if there is single (the datasource that has \"org.apache.spark\" prefix).\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.range(1).write.format(\"csv\").mode(\"overwrite\").save(\"/tmp/abc\")\r\n17/05/10 09:47:44 WARN

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn Structured Streaming, the \"isStreaming\" property will be eliminated in each triggerLogicalPlan. Then, some rules will be applied to this triggerLogicalPlan mistakenly. So, we should refactor existing code to better execute batch query and ss query.\r\n\r\nLike in #17896, we will eliminate `EventTimeWatermark` in any batch query. If we add this rule into `Analyzer.batches`, we will eliminate the `EventTimeWatermark` in triggerLogicalPlan mistakenly, as it is also a `batch query` in current implementation.\r\n\r\n## How was

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe current implementation of computePrincipalComponentsAndExplainedVariance in RowMatrix for tall and fat matrices usually crashes as it computes the covariance matrix locally.\r\n\r\nInstead in this patch I used the same RowMatrix.computeSVD which is already optimized for big matrices, to compute the Principal components and Explained Variance.\r\n\r\nIt's known that if a matrix X with mean µ and covariance (X - µ)'(X - µ)\r\n(X - µ) can be decomposed with SVD such that\r\n\r\n(X - µ) = USV'\r\nand\r\n(X - µ)' = VS'U'\r\n\r\nV and U are orthonormal, therefore V'V = I and U'U = I.\r\ncov = (X - µ)'(X -µ) = VS'U'USV' = VS'SV'\r\nand\r\ncov*V = V(S'S), with V the eigenvectors of covariance and S'S contains the eigenvalues\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis patch has been tested running the current RowMatrixSuite, mllib.PCASuite and ml.PCASuite, passing all the tests.\r\n\r\nAlso, this patch allowed to run PCA over a matrix 56k x 12k without crashing from OutOfMemory errors (not included in testing as it takes long time to execute and it's generated by a private dataset)\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-09T03:35:24Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T19:48:35Z","closed_at":"2018-07-04T01:57:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e2231898fb5b951aedcaa920bbb4b63de45dd0eb","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17907/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17907/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17907/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a1082b26a19fd3c05b1af4bb59fa56d50e7c6cfa","head":{"label":"ghoto:master","ref":"master","sha":"a1082b26a19fd3c05b1af4bb59fa56d50e7c6cfa","user":{"login":"ghoto","id":1140311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDAzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1140311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto","html_url":"https://github.com/ghoto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":90555178,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5MDU1NTE3OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"ghoto/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ghoto","id":1140311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDAzMTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1140311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto","html_url":"https://github.com/ghoto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ghoto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ghoto/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n#14617 added new columns to the executor table causing the visibility checks for the logs and threadDump columns to toggle the wrong columns since they used hard-coded column numbers.\r\n\r\nI've updated the checks to use column names instead of numbers so future updates don't accidentally break this again. \r\n\r\nNote: This will also need to be back ported into 2.2 since #14617 was merged there\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes three things as below:\r\n\r\n- Use casting rules to a timestamp in `to_timestamp` by default (it was `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`).\r\n\r\n- Support single argument for `to_timestamp` similarly with APIs in other languages.\r\n\r\n  For example, the one below works\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  import org.apache.spark.sql.functions._\r\n  Seq(\"2016-12-31 00:12:00.00\").toDF(\"a\").select(to_timestamp(col(\"a\"))).show()\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  prints\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  |to_timestamp(`a`, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')|\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  |                     2016-12-31 00:12:00|\r\n  +----------------------------------------+\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  whereas this does not work in SQL.\r\n\r\n  **Before**\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  spark-sql> SELECT to_timestamp('2016-12-31 00:12:00');\r\n  Error in query: Invalid number of arguments for function to_timestamp; line 1 pos 7\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  **After**\r\n\r\n  ```  \r\n  spark-sql> SELECT to_timestamp('2016-12-31 00:12:00');\r\n  2016-12-31 00:12:00\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n- Related document improvement for SQL function descriptions and other API descriptions accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n  **Before**\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n  spark-sql> DESCRIBE FUNCTION

explicitly handle the EventTimeWatermark logical plan. \r\nThe right solution is to simply remove the plan node, as the watermark should not affect any batch query in any way.\r\n\r\nChanges: \r\n- In this PR, we add a new rule `EliminateEventTimeWatermark` to check if we need to ignore the event time watermark.

We can not add this rule into analyzer directly, because streaming query will be copied to `triggerLogicalPlan ` in every trigger, and the rule will be applied to `triggerLogicalPlan` mistakenly.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe new SQL parser is introduced into Spark 2.0. All string literals are unescaped in parser. Seems it bring an issue regarding the regex pattern string.\r\n\r\nThe following codes can reproduce it:\r\n\r\n    val data = Seq(\"\\u0020\\u0021\\u0023\", \"abc\")\r\n    val df = data.toDF()\r\n\r\n    // 1st usage: works in 1.6\r\n    // Let parser parse pattern string\r\n    val rlike1 = df.filter(\"value rlike '^\\\\x20[\\\\x20-\\\\x23]+$'\")\r\n    // 2nd usage: works in 1.6, 2.x\r\n    // Call Column.rlike so the pattern string is a literal which doesn't go through parser\r\n    val rlike2 = df.filter($\"value\".rlike(\"^\\\\x20[\\\\x20-\\\\x23]+$\"))\r\n\r\n    // In 2.x, we need add backslashes to make regex pattern parsed correctly\r\n    val rlike3 = df.filter(\"value rlike '^\\\\\\\\x20[\\\\\\\\x20-\\\\\\\\x23]+$'\")\r\n\r\nFollow the discussion in #17736, this patch adds a config to fallback to 1.6 string literal parsing and mitigate migration issue.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-07T05:11:16Z","updated_at":"2023-12-27T18:20:34Z","closed_at":"2017-05-12T03:18:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c0e95cbf36d7ad364070cebe1f8d43c4955decb0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17887/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17887/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17887/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/375eb9cd747cc75d2f51da1dabe824dbbce52790","head":{"label":"viirya:add-config-fallback-string-parsing","ref":"add-config-fallback-string-parsing","sha":"375eb9cd747cc75d2f51da1dabe824dbbce52790","user":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21467907,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQ2NzkwNw==","name":"spark-1","full_name":"viirya/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"viirya","id":68855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya","html_url":"https://github.com/viirya","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/viirya/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/viirya/spark-1","description":"Mirror

We've been using the local version string to disambiguate between different hadoop versions packaged with PySpark, but PEP0440 states that local versions should not be used when publishing up-stream. Since we no longer make PySpark pip packages for different hadoop versions, we can simply drop the hadoop information.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nStringIndexer maps labels to numbers according to the descending order of label frequency. Other types of ordering (e.g., alphabetical) may be needed in feature ETL.  For example, the ordering will affect the result in one-hot encoding and RFormula. \r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support other ordering methods and we add a parameter `stringOrderType` that supports the following four options:\r\n- 'frequencyDesc': descending order by label frequency (most frequent label assigned 0)\r\n- 'frequencyAsc': ascending order by label frequency (least frequent label assigned 0)\r\n- 'alphabetDesc': descending alphabetical order\r\n- 'alphabetAsc': ascending alphabetical order\r\n\r\nThe default is still descending order of label frequency, so there should be no impact to existing programs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nnew test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are flooding logs in AppVeyor (in the console). This has been fine because we can download all the logs. However, (given my observations so far), logs are truncated when there are too many. It has been grown recently and it started to get truncated. For example, see  https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ApacheSoftwareFoundation/spark/build/1209-master\r\n\r\nEven after the log is downloaded, it looks truncated as below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[00:44:21] 17/05/04 18:56:18 INFO TaskSetManager: Finished task 197.0 in stage 601.0 (TID 9211) in 0 ms on localhost (executor driver) (194/200)\r\n[00:44:21] 17/05/04 18:56:18 INFO Executor: Running task 199.0 in stage 601.0 (TID 9213)\r\n[00:44:21] 17/05/04 18:56:18 INFO Executor: Finished task 198.0 in stage 601.0 (TID 9212). 2473 bytes result sent to driver\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nProbably, it looks better to use the same log4j configuration that we are using for SparkR tests in Jenkins(please see https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fc472bddd1d9c6a28e57e31496c0166777af597e/R/run-tests.sh#L26 and https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/fc472bddd1d9c6a28e57e31496c0166777af597e/R/log4j.properties)\r\n```\r\n# Set everything to be logged to the file target/unit-tests.log\r\nlog4j.rootCategory=INFO, file\r\nlog4j.appender.file=org.apache.log4j.FileAppender\r\nlog4j.appender.file.append=true\r\nlog4j.appender.file.file=R/target/unit-tests.log\r\nlog4j.appender.file.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout\r\nlog4j.appender.file.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS} %t %p %c{1}: %m%n\r\n\r\n# Ignore messages below warning level from Jetty, because it's a bit verbose\r\nlog4j.logger.org.eclipse.jetty=WARN\r\norg.eclipse.jetty.LEVEL=WARN\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested with @spark-test account\r\n  - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spark-test/spark/build/672-r-log4j (there is an example for flaky test here)\r\n  - https://ci.appveyor.com/project/spark-test/spark/build/673-r-log4j (I re-ran the build).\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-05T13:54:12Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:42:09Z","closed_at":"2017-05-06T04:29:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d582e68af8631bfae0aa534cbbe38fd93b3edea0","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17873/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17873/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17873/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/4d4e6f02ee9270eef2646c404cd46a097e517203","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:appveyor-reduce-logs","ref":"appveyor-reduce-logs","sha":"4d4e6f02ee9270eef2646c404cd46a097e517203","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\njira: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20602\r\n\r\nCurrently LinearSVC in Spark only supports OWLQN as the optimizer ( check https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-14709). I made comparison between LBFGS and OWLQN on several public dataset and found LBFGS converges much faster for LinearSVC in most cases.\r\nThe following table presents the number of training iterations and f1 score of both optimizers until convergence\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7981698/27114050-b5ff623e-5075-11e7-8446-f8b9ff6bb55e.png)\r\n\r\ndata source:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn applications that use over 2000 executors, we noticed a large number of failed executors due to driver overloading with too many executor RPCs within a short period of time (for example, retrieve spark properties, executor registration). This patch adds an extra configuration spark.yarn.launchContainer.count.simultaneously, which caps the maximal number of containers that driver can ask for and launch in every spark.yarn.scheduler.heartbeat.interval-ms. As a result, the number of executors grows steadily. The number of executor failures is reduced and applications can reach the desired number of executors faster.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n1. Didn't break relevant unit tests\r\n2. Tested with a spark application (2500 executors) on a Yarn cluster with 3000 machines. \r\n\r\nA gentle ping to the contributors of YarnAllocator: @srowen @foxish @jinxing64 @squito \r\nA JIRA is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdded call to copy values of Params from Estimator to Model after fit in PySpark ML.  This will copy values for any params that are also defined in the Model.  Since currently most Models do not define the same params from the Estimator, also added method to create new Params from looking at the Java object if they do not exist in the Python object.  This is a temporary fix that can be removed once the PySpark models properly define the params themselves.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRefactored the `check_params` test to optionally check if the model params for Python and Java match and added this check to an existing fitted model that shares params between Estimator and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nLike [Hive UDFType](https://hive.apache.org/javadocs/r2.0.1/api/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/udf/UDFType.html), we should allow users to add the extra flags for ScalaUDF and JavaUDF too. _stateful_/_impliesOrder_ are not applicable to our Scala UDF. Thus, we only add the following two flags. \r\n\r\n- deterministic: Certain optimizations should not be applied if UDF is not deterministic. Deterministic UDF returns same result each time it is invoked with a particular input. This determinism just needs to hold within the context of a query.\r\n\r\nWhen the deterministic flag is not correctly set, the results could be wrong. \r\n\r\nFor ScalaUDF in Dataset APIs, users can call the following extra APIs for `UserDefinedFunction` to make the corresponding changes.\r\n- `nonDeterministic`: Updates UserDefinedFunction to non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed the Java UDF name loss issue.\r\n\r\nWill submit a separate PR for `distinctLike`  for UDAF\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases for both ScalaUDF\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nOne of the common usability problems around reading data in spark (particularly CSV) is that there can often be a conflict between different readers in the classpath.\r\n\r\nAs an example, if someone launches a 2.x spark shell with the spark-csv package in the classpath, Spark currently fails in an extremely unfriendly way (see https://github.com/databricks/spark-csv/issues/367):\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n./bin/spark-shell --packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.11:1.5.0\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.csv(\"/foo/bar.csv\")\r\njava.lang.RuntimeException: Multiple sources found for csv (org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.csv.CSVFileFormat, com.databricks.spark.csv.DefaultSource15), please specify the fully qualified class name.\r\n  at scala.sys.package$.error(package.scala:27)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource$.lookupDataSource(DataSource.scala:574)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.providingClass$lzycompute(DataSource.scala:85)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.providingClass(DataSource.scala:85)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.execution.datasources.DataSource.resolveRelation(DataSource.scala:295)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.load(DataFrameReader.scala:178)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.csv(DataFrameReader.scala:533)\r\n  at org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrameReader.csv(DataFrameReader.scala:412)\r\n  ... 48 elided\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch proposes a simple way of fixing this error by always mapping default input data source formats to inlined classes (that exist in Spark):\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n./bin/spark-shell --packages com.databricks:spark-csv_2.11:1.5.0\r\nscala> val df = spark.read.csv(\"/foo/bar.csv\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [_c0: string]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport Mesos Maintenance by making the Spark Scheduler decline offers that might go under maintenance when a task is running on it.\r\n\r\nAdded a configurable threshold which is the users estimate of how long a task would take up an offer for, and then decide whether the Scheduler can schedule a task on that offer or not.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests that ensure that offers with unavailability set are appropriately handled.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`ReplSuite.newProductSeqEncoder with REPL defined class` was flaky and throws OOM exception frequently. By analyzing the heap dump, we found the reason is that, in each test case of `ReplSuite`, we create a REPL instance, which creates a classloader and loads a lot of classes related to `SparkContext`. More details please see https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17833#issuecomment-298711435.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we create a new test suite, `SingletonReplSuite`, which shares one REPL instances among all the test cases. Then we move most of the tests from `ReplSuite` to `SingletonReplSuite`, to avoid creating a lot of REPL instances and reduce memory footprint.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\ntest

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes three things as below:\r\n\r\n- This test looks not testing `<=>` and identical with the test above, `===`. So, it removes the test.\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  -   test(\"<=>\") {\r\n  -     checkAnswer(\r\n  -      testData2.filter($\"a\" === 1),\r\n  -      testData2.collect().toSeq.filter(r => r.getInt(0) == 1))\r\n  -\r\n  -    checkAnswer(\r\n  -      testData2.filter($\"a\" === $\"b\"),\r\n  -      testData2.collect().toSeq.filter(r => r.getInt(0) == r.getInt(1)))\r\n  -   }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n\r\n- Replace the test title from `=!=` to `<=>`. It looks the test actually testing `<=>`.\r\n\r\n  ```diff\r\n  +  private lazy val nullData = Seq(\r\n  +    (Some(1), Some(1)), (Some(1), Some(2)), (Some(1), None), (None, None)).toDF(\"a\",

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWe allow users to specify hints (currently only \"broadcast\" is supported) in SQL and DataFrame. However, while SQL has a standard hint format (/*+ ... */), DataFrame doesn't have one and sometimes users are confused that they can't find how to apply a broadcast hint. This ticket adds a generic hint function on DataFrame that allows using the same hint on DataFrames as well as SQL.\r\n\r\nAs an example, after this patch, the following will apply a broadcast hint on a DataFrame using the new hint function:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf1.join(df2.hint(\"broadcast\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a test case in DataFrameJoinSuite.\r\n","created_at":"2017-05-03T06:04:08Z","updated_at":"2017-05-03T16:25:17Z","closed_at":"2017-05-03T16:25:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0a63e8a7a40d1c04387cb8b47b88dcb4f65954c8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17839/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17839/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17839/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b84badc29c5ca315791e4d023bdebb046e0b3b4f","head":{"label":"rxin:SPARK-20576","ref":"SPARK-20576","sha":"b84badc29c5ca315791e4d023bdebb046e0b3b4f","user":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17192644,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE5MjY0NA==","name":"spark","full_name":"rxin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rxin","id":323388,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyMzM4OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/323388?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin","html_url":"https://github.com/rxin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rxin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rxin/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new `spark-hadoop-cloud` module and maven profile to pull in object store support from `hadoop-openstack`, `hadoop-aws` and `hadoop-azure` (Hadoop 2.7+) JARs, along with their dependencies, fixing up the dependencies so that everything works, in particular Jackson.\r\n\r\nIt restores `s3n://` access to S3, adds its `s3a://` replacement, OpenStack `swift://` and azure `wasb://`.\r\n\r\nThere's a documentation page, `cloud_integration.md`, which covers the basic details of using Spark with object stores, referring the reader to the supplier's own documentation, with specific warnings on security and the possible mismatch between a store's behavior and that of a filesystem. In particular, users are advised be very cautious when trying to use an object store as the destination of data, and to consult the documentation of the storage supplier and the connector. \r\n\r\n(this is the successor to #12004; I can't re-open it)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDownstream tests exist in [https://github.com/steveloughran/spark-cloud-examples/tree/master/cloud-examples](https://github.com/steveloughran/spark-cloud-examples/tree/master/cloud-examples)\r\n\r\nThose verify that the dependencies are sufficient to allow downstream applications to work with s3a, azure wasb and swift storage connectors, and perform basic IO & dataframe operations thereon.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nTo better understand this problem, let's take a look at an example first:\r\n```\r\nobject Main {\r\n  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {\r\n    var t = new Test\r\n    new Thread(new Runnable {\r\n      override def run() = {}\r\n    }).start()\r\n    println(\"first thread finished\")\r\n\r\n    t.a = null\r\n    t = new Test\r\n    new Thread(new Runnable {\r\n      override def run() = {}\r\n    }).start()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Test {\r\n  var a = new InheritableThreadLocal[String] {\r\n    override protected def childValue(parent: String): String = {\r\n      println(\"parent value is: \" + parent)\r\n      parent\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  a.set(\"hello\")\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe result is:\r\n```\r\nparent value is: hello\r\nfirst thread finished\r\nparent value is: hello\r\nparent value is: hello\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce an `InheritableThreadLocal` has been set value, child threads will inherit its value as long as it has not been GCed, so setting the variable which holds the `InheritableThreadLocal` to `null` doesn't work as we expected.\r\n\r\nIn `SparkContext`, we have an `InheritableThreadLocal` for local properties, we should clear it when stopping `SparkContext`, or all the future child threads will still inherit it and copy the properties and waste memory.\r\n\r\nThis is the root cause of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-20548 , which creates/stops `SparkContext` many times and finally have a lot of `InheritableThreadLocal` alive, and cause OOM when starting new threads in the internal thread pools.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add both `isNotDistinctFrom` and `isDistinctFrom` to both Scala and Python column APIs.\r\n\r\n`IS [NOT] DISTINCT FROM` syntax is now supported in favour of https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17764\r\n\r\nAdding a Python API was initially suggested in that PR but that PR turned to SQL syntax change only. Per https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17764#discussion_r114048387 I assume we want this.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nDoctests for Python and unit tests in
