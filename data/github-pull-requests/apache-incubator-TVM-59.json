the Relay to TIR python hook for the NPU so that optimizations can be applied across the whole module and not just functions that will be offloaded to the NPU. A pass `OutlineCompilerFunctions` is introduced to outline NPU functions, which now happens before optimization passes are run (this previously happened after the prim_func had been created).\r\n\r\nIn addition, optimization passes that should only run on NPU functions are now limited to running on outlined functions for the NPU (by checking the \"Compiler\" attribute). To help avoid code duplication, a helpful decorator `npu_pass` has been created for python passes that should only run on NPU functions.\r\n\r\nThis refactor helps move a number of passes in the microNPU codegen to use an IRModule -> IRModule philosophy.\r\n\r\ncc @manupa-arm @ekalda @NicolaLancellotti @dchauhan-arm

the VectorizeLoop pass, when scalarizing a vectorized loop into serialized loop (for reasons like it's not vectorizable), the for-loop is not properly constructed to respect the loop variable's dtype.

for contributing to TVM!   Please refer to guideline https://tvm.apache.org/docs/contribute/ for useful information and tips. After the pull request is submitted, please request code reviews from [Reviewers](https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md#reviewers) by @ them in the pull request thread.\r\n\r\nSimple Flatten operator's shape cannot be evaluated when using ONNX. This is because the flatten op does not try to do constant folding thus creating unnecessary dynamic operator, causing graph executor unable to execute it.\r\n\r\nTo trigger this bug, simply use this script to generate a ONNX model and run it with graph executor.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport torch\r\n\r\nN = 1 # can be something else\r\n\r\nclass Net(torch.nn.Module):\r\n    def __init__(self) -> None:\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n    \r\n    def forward(self, x):\r\n        return x.flatten()\r\n\r\nnet = Net().eval()\r\n\r\no = net(torch.zeros((N), dtype=torch.float))\r\nprint(o.shape)\r\n\r\nwith torch.no_grad():\r\n  torch.onnx.export(net, (\r\n      torch.ones((N), dtype=torch.float)), \"output.onnx\", verbose=True, opset_version=14)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will throw errors: the relay script is unnecessarily complicated.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef @main(%v0: Tensor[(1), float32]) -> Tensor[(?, ?), float32] {\r\n  %0 = shape_of(%v0, dtype=\"int32\") /* ty=Tensor[(1), int32] */;\r\n  %1 = strided_slice(%0, begin=[0], end=[0], strides=[1], axes=None) /* ty=Tensor[(0), int32] */;\r\n  %2 = strided_slice(%0, begin=[0], end=[1], strides=[1], axes=None) /* ty=Tensor[(1), int32] */;\r\n  %3 = prod(%1, keepdims=True) /* ty=Tensor[(1), int32] */;\r\n  %4 = prod(%2, keepdims=True) /* ty=Tensor[(1), int32] */;\r\n  %5 = (%3, %4);\r\n  %6 = concatenate(%5) /* ty=Tensor[(2), int32] */;\r\n  dyn.reshape(%v0, %6, newshape=[]) /* ty=Tensor[(?, ?), float32] */\r\n}\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n...\r\n    executor = relay.build_module.create_executor(\r\n  File \"/home/ganler/Documents/tvm/python/tvm/relay/backend/interpreter.py\", line 171, in evaluate\r\n    return self._make_executor()\r\n  File

primary goal of this PR is to add codegen for 2d physical layouts in CodeGenHexagon.\r\n\r\n* Correctly update buffer objects in `IndexMap`.\r\n* Extend `CodeGenLLVM::BufferAccessHelper` to allow for N-d buffer access.  `CodeGenLLVM` is still limited to flat 1-d memory buffers, but this allows subclasses to support some forms of N-d buffers by overriding `Subclass::CreateBufferPtr`.\r\n* Implement `CodeGenHexagon::CreateBufferPtr` to allow for 2-d buffer access.\r\n* Added unit tests to define desired behavior.  Currently, this only checks that the Hexagon module can be built.  Tests to verify that the generated code will produce expected results depends on allocation support added in #10558.","created_at":"2022-03-11T20:53:26Z","updated_at":"2022-03-15T15:31:14Z","closed_at":"2022-03-15T15:13:04Z","merged_at":"2022-03-15T15:13:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a636a9433f1650991c7c4b9b9a588bc29e794a1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10586/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/10586/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/issues/10586/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/tvm/statuses/b3ae624eb6bf6130f6d614ded52fb88cf1ff03b1","head":{"label":"Lunderberg:hexagon_nd_load_store","ref":"hexagon_nd_load_store","sha":"b3ae624eb6bf6130f6d614ded52fb88cf1ff03b1","user":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":355587696,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTU1ODc2OTY=","name":"tvm","full_name":"Lunderberg/tvm","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Lunderberg","id":3888575,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM4ODg1NzU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3888575?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg","html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Lunderberg/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Lunderberg/tvm","description":"Open

After https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9727, the low level TIR memory access is on `Buffer` objects. The `Buffer` has `elem_offset` \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/e34985b5b89e13cbbb7ebddee1ec5c1470a952f6/include/tvm/tir/buffer.h#L79-L80\r\nThus the addressing rule for `BufferLoad`, `BufferStore` and `T.address_of` should also take this offset field into consideration.\r\n\r\n- Also, the buffer combine functionality in `StorageRewrite` pass currently create alias buffers to the alloc buffer var, which denotes the start offset of the merged buffer. But it seems illness since the alias buffer's accessed indices exceed the alias buffer extent.\r\n    ```python\r\n    # example from ut \r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def func(A: T.Buffer[(4,), \"float32\"], A4: T.Buffer[(8,), \"float32\"]) -> None:\r\n        A0 = T.allocate([16], \"float32\", \"global:tag\")\r\n        A0_1 = T.buffer_decl([8], dtype=\"float32\", data=A0.data, scope=\"global:tag\")\r\n        A0_2 = T.buffer_decl([8], dtype=\"float32\", data=A0.data, scope=\"global:tag\")\r\n        A0_3 = T.buffer_decl([8], dtype=\"float32\", data=A0.data, scope=\"global:tag\")\r\n        A0_4 = T.buffer_decl([8], dtype=\"float32\", data=A0.data, scope=\"global:tag\")\r\n        for i in T.serial(8):\r\n            A0_1[i] = A[i] + A[0] + T.float32(1)\r\n        for i in T.serial(8):\r\n            A0_2[8 + i] = A0_1[i] + A0_1[0] + T.float32(2)\r\n        for i in T.serial(8):\r\n            A0_3[i] = A0_2[8 + i] + A0_2[8] + T.float32(3)\r\n        for i in T.serial(8):\r\n            A0_4[8 + i] = A0_3[i] + A0_3[0] + T.float32(4)\r\n        for i in T.serial(8):\r\n            A4[i] = A0_4[8 + i] + A0_4[8] + T.float32(5)\r\n    ```\r\n    It would be great to set `elem_offset` to alias buffers, thus each alias buffer's address range is marked explicitly.\r\n    ```python\r\n    @T.prim_func\r\n    def func(A: T.Buffer[(4,), \"float32\"], A4: T.Buffer[(8,), \"float32\"]) -> None:\r\n        A0 = T.allocate([16], \"float32\", \"global:tag\")\r\n        A0_1 = T.buffer_decl([8], dtype=\"float32\",

goal of this commit is to reduce/eliminate common code required through unit tests that interact with Hexagon hardware.\r\n\r\n- New testing fixtures in `tests/python/contrib/test_hexagon`.  A test   running on hexagon hardware should only need to use the   `hexagon_session` fixture.\r\n\r\n  - `rpc_server_port`: Iterates through port numbers, selecting an unused port for each unit test.  Avoids needing to explicitly specify unique ports for each unit test.\r\n\r\n  - `tvm_tracker`: Starts a tracker on use, exits after test.  Avoids needing to manually start a tracker prior to running the unit test.\r\n\r\n  - `hexagon_launcher`: Starts a `HexagonLauncher` server on use, stops server after test.  Avoids needing to call `start_server()` and `stop_server()` in each test.\r\n\r\n  - `hexagon_session`: Starts a hexagon session using `hexagon_launcher.start_session()`, exits after test.\r\n\r\n- Added `Session.upload` function, which delegates to `HexagonLauncher.upload`.  Avoids needing to interact with both the launcher and the session.\r\n\r\n- Allowed `tvm.IRModule` as argument passed to `Session.load_module`, which will automatically save/upload the module, then load it. Avoids needing to handle save/upload of temporary files in each unit

on https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10561, add a new interface for task extraction that doesn't require the whole `VMCompiler.lower()`. Extracted tasks are the same as ones from the existing flow. Currently only enabled for meta schedule, but I believe it is worth adapting for autotvm / ansor cc @comaniac @tkonolige \r\n\r\nI'm currently working on a model where TE scheduling leads to an error during lowering, but TIR scheduling might work. I wanted to try the latter, but currently task extraction entails (for no reason) TE schedule application and lowering, which leads to the said error. This motivated this work, which aims to remove the unnecessary TE scheduling steps from the task extraction process.\r\n\r\nPlease review @junrushao1994 @mbs-octoml @jroesch

All,\r\n\r\nI am using TFLite frontend to parse some nets, but hit the unsupported quantized `exp`.\r\n\r\nApparently, it supports the quantized unary element-wise operators. I found this tracking [issue](https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/9187) and then I deleted the `assert` and re-orginized the tests accordingly. (`ceil, floor, round, exp, log, tan, cos`).\r\n\r\nI also found the version check [here](https://github.com/apache/tvm/blob/201a58448fe8a4f8160afd03b86ff5ff7c1360e4/tests/python/frontend/tflite/test_forward.py#L3452) that is not correct.

search sorted function was used in the sparse-tir project to perform binary search on indices array. I need to rebase the sparse-tir repo to relax project so I start to push some changes upstream. This PR adds the search sorted function to TIR built-ins. The semantic of `searchsorted` is the same as numpy's (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.searchsorted.html), we add two arguments `offset_l` and `offset_r` to indicate the interval bound.\r\n\r\n@masahi suggests using IRBuilder to define the fine-grained description of binary search. However, at current stage I don't want to decompose the binary search to more fine-grained instructions (this would make the intermediate IR too redundant, and not convenient for scheduling).\r\n\r\nI leave the codegen on LLVM a future work.\r\n\r\n@MasterJH5574  @junrushao1994

PR modifies the `texture2d_alloca` builtin --- a specialized intrinsic for allocating texture memory --- to a more general form called `nd_mem_alloc_with_scope` and provides a lowering for that builtin for both texture memory / OpenCL and VTCM / Hexagon.\r\n\r\nThis change allows for allocations from `cache_read` and `cache_write` schedule primitives with VTCM storage scope to be lowered to specialized interfaces in the Hexagon Device API to allocate and free VTCM:  `AllocVtcmWorkspace` and `FreeVtcmWorkspace`.  Where previously those allocations were lowered to `AllocWorkspace` and `FreeWorkspace` which allocate and free DDR.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes possible but does not address a standard (rather than

apache/tvm#9829\r\n\r\nThe above behavior avoids having TE output Tensors change in address everytime by caching the tensors instead of reallocating everytime. However in doing so they introduce a cyclic dependency. Each `Operation` has a list of `Tensors`. However, each `Tensor` has a reference to the `Operation`. As a result, each will always have a reference to each other and never be deleted under TVM's reference counting system.\r\n\r\nPossible alternatives:\r\n- Something like a weak_ptr, probably so a counted reference exists between the tensor --> operator but not in the opposite direction.

makes it a little easier to gather CI signal on a PR by ensuring that all pytest invocations run. Currently pytest runs through to completion for a single invocation so some failures are gathered, but not all. This is annoying for development since its hard to guage how a PR actually fared in CI without seeing the full picture. This will increase demands on CI since failures won't cause the skip the following pytests, but we can monitor CI to see if this has a big impact on queue times. This may make finding failures in CI logs harder too since there will probably be more scrolling involved, though coalescing pytest invocations, Jenkins' `Tests` viewer, and #10476 will help make it easier to find failed tests.\r\n\r\nThis also also kind of a stop-gap since this wouldn't be an issue if we used a single pytest invocation, but that is difficult to do completely since we rely on loading `tvm` multiple times over the course of the test suite (e.g. for tensorflow memory tests and `cython` vs `ctypes` ffi).\r\n\r\nExample failure from #10523:

issues as: \r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10172\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9582\r\n\r\nThe select node requires that `ture_value.dtype() == false_value.dtype()`. While sometimes it is not the case when doing \"Narrow Datatype\" optimization. This usually happens when we have an `argmin` / `argmax` node with some other nodes. The workaround is to make `true_value` and `false_value` type-compatible before creating a `Select` node.\r\n\r\nAn artificial ONNX model triggering this bug is attached:

a python temporary directory with a context manager in an effort to solve the flaky FVP tests raised in #10300 and #10314.

depending on whether the implied iterators of the two ramp nodes are shared.\r\n\r\nThis is a alternate draft PR to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10512, which instead introduces a less

of tracking issue https://github.com/apache/tvm/issues/10505, restrict multi-lane indexing to at most one index per buffer access.  This removes ambiguity as an expression such as `A[T.ramp(i,1,2), T.ramp(j,1,2)]`, which could be interpreted either as `[A[i,j], A[i+1,j+1]]` or as `[A[i,j], A[i,j+1], A[i+1,j], A[i+1,j+1]]`, depending on whether the implied iterators of the two ramp nodes are shared.\r\n\r\nThis is a alternate draft PR to https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10513, which instead introduces a more restrictive condition that allows the last index to have multiple

PR fixes some bugs related to the microNPU performance model in the cascader.\r\n\r\n* Fixed incorrect num_blocks calculations for both BufferModes.\r\n* Fixed similar issues with Read/Write byte calculations.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the 'partkernel' flag was not propagated to the performance estimation code.\r\n* Fixed single buffering check incorrectly used output shape and block rather than the input shape and block.\r\n* Fixed block config not aligned to micro block for Elementwise.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on and includes the changes in https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/10508 and

PR adds multiple options to the cascader. One option is to toggle multi-dimensional striping and it is disabled by default. The reasoning is that exploring striping in more than 1 dimension has a very high computational cost.\r\nThe remainder of the options are aimed towards developers/debugging and are prefixed with dev_. The options are exposed to tvmc. It also introduces the ability to dump information about the cascader proposals to a .json file.\r\n\r\nCo-authored-by: Matthew Barrett

`relay.build` a IRModule in which a function whose returned value includes another function exists, TVM will crash with **segmentation fault**. Initially I assume this is the behavior disllowed by TVM, but in `test_analysis_basic_block_normal_form.py`, the following function shows the tolerance of it.\r\n```python\r\n@pytest.mark.xfail(raises=tvm.error.TVMError)\r\ndef test_func():\r\n    x = relay.var(\"x\", shape=(1,), dtype=\"float32\")  # , a)\r\n    y = relay.var(\"y\", shape=(1,), dtype=\"float32\")  # , a)\r\n    z = relay.var(\"z\", shape=(1,), dtype=\"float32\")  # , a)\r\n    x2 = relay.add(x, x)\r\n    func_a = relay.Function([y], relay.add(x2, y))  # , a, [a])\r\n    func_b = relay.Function([z], relay.add(x2, z))  # , a, [a])\r\n    body = relay.Tuple([func_a, func_b])\r\n    body = relay.Function([x], body)\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    fn (%x: Tensor[(1), float32]) {\r\n      %1 = fn (%y: Tensor[(1), float32]) {\r\n        %0 = add(%x, %x);\r\n        add(%0, %y)\r\n      };\r\n      %2 = fn (%z: Tensor[(1), float32]) {\r\n        add(%0, %z)\r\n      };\r\n      (%1, %2)\r\n    }\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    check_basic_block_normal_form(body)\r\n```\r\nSo I write the following script with simpler structure to fuzz TVM:\r\n```python\r\nimport tvm\r\nfrom tvm import relay\r\nmod = tvm.IRModule()\r\nx = relay.var(\"x\", shape=(1,), dtype=\"float32\")\r\nx2 = relay.add(x, x)\r\nf = relay.Function([x], x2)\r\n# body = relay.Tuple([f,])\r\nbody = relay.Function([], f)\r\nmod['main'] = body\r\nmod = relay.transform.InferType()(mod)\r\nprint(mod.astext(show_meta_data=False))\r\ngraph, lib, params = relay.build(mod, target='llvm')\r\n```\r\nThe relay IR is easy, only including a function whose returned value is another function\r\n```\r\n#[version = \"0.0.5\"]\r\ndef @main() -> fn (Tensor[(1), float32]) -> Tensor[(1), float32] {\r\n  fn (%x: Tensor[(1), float32]) -> Tensor[(1), float32] {\r\n    add(%x, %x) /* ty=Tensor[(1), float32] */\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAs expected, segmentation fault showed up.\r\nBy bug localization, I find this problem is caused during memory allocation in graph_executor_codegen. More concretely, function `CalculateRelayExprSizeBytes` forgets the situation where the type returned variable could be of FuncType and directly turns the typenode into TensorTypeNode. Then `auto shape = tensor_type->shape;` triggers the

recent improvement in GPU frontend tests, I found that `topi: GPU` has become a bottleneck. From the log https://ci.tlcpack.ai/blue/organizations/jenkins/tvm/detail/PR-10391/14/pipeline/319, it is clear that topi tests are running on target `llvm -device=arm_cpu` and `cuda -libs=cudnn`, which I claim is completely redundant since we already run on `llvm` and `cuda` targets. \r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/apache/tvm/pull/9905, I've already removed them from `DEFAULT_TEST_TARGETS`, but `topi: GPU` uses its own list of targets which still includes `llvm -device=arm_cpu` and `cuda -libs=cudnn`. I propose to remove them from topi test targets, which hopefully will cut topi GPU tests time by half.

To deploy we will first run this and push to the `asf-site2` branch (as configured in Jenkins). Once we see that the output is valid, we can flip the switch in Jenkins to start updating the `asf-site` branch instead.
