href=\"https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/blob/master/CHANGES\">jsoup's changelog</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>jsoup changelog</p>\n<p>*** Release 1.15.1 [PENDING]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Change: removed previously deprecated methods and classes (including org.jsoup.safety.Whitelist; use\norg.jsoup.safety.Safelist instead).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when converting jsoup Documents to W3C Documents in W3CDom, preserve HTML valid attribute names if the\ninput document is using the HTML syntax. (Previously, would always coerce using the more restrictive XML syntax.)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1648\">jhy/jsoup#1648</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added the :containsWholeText(text) selector, to match against non-normalized Element text. That can be\nuseful when elements can only be distinguished by e.g. specific case, or leading whitespace, etc.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1636\">jhy/jsoup#1636</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when evaluating an XPath query against a context element, the complete document is now visible to the\nquery, vs only the context element's sub-tree. This enables support for queries outside (parent or sibling) the\nelement, e.g. ancestor-or-self::*.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1652\">jhy/jsoup#1652</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>*** Release 1.14.3 [2021-Sep-30]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added native XPath support in Element#selectXpath(String)\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1629\">jhy/jsoup#1629</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added full support for the &lt;template&gt; tag to the HTML5 parser spec.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1634\">jhy/jsoup#1634</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added support in CharacterReader to track newlines, so that parse errors can be reported more\nintuitively.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1624\">jhy/jsoup#1624</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: tracked parse errors now have more details, including the erroneous token, to help clarify the errors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: speed and memory optimizations for the :has(subquery) selector.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: the :contains(text) and :containsOwn(text) selectors are now whitespace normalized, aligning to the\ndocument text that they are matching against.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/876\">jhy/jsoup#876</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element, speed optimized adopting all of an element's child nodes into a currently empty element.\nImproves the HTML adoption agency algorithm when adopting elements with many children.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1638\">jhy/jsoup#1638</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: increased the parse speed when in RCData (e.g. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and unescaped <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tokens are found, by\nmemoizing the <!-- raw HTML omitted --> scan and reducing GC.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1644\">jhy/jsoup#1644</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when parsing custom tags (in HTML or XML), added a flyweight cache on Tag.valueOf(name) to reduce\nmemory overhead when many tags are repeated. Also tuned other areas of the parser when many very deeply stacked\ncustom elements were present.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1646\">jhy/jsoup#1646</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

changes from 4.1.3 regarding resource resolution.  A regression was caused in attempt to get rid of underlying deeply nested path for add-on plugins such as sb-contrib (fb-contrib).  Prior logic restored and support for windows based path added.  The underlying jars still get copied to target after this but no longer deeply nested.  A separate ticket is open to look at figuring out how to remove those from creation.</li>\n<li>Replace deprecated groovy toInteger with as Integer</li>\n<li>Support spotbugs 4.2.0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Build changes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replaced travis-ci with github actions.</li>\n<li>Supporting build on windows / macos now in addition to ubuntu.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Spotbugs Maven Plugin 4.1.4</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Support spotbugs 4.1.4</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/5530040d7940f5326f844f2ef38b8e487da1537b\"><code>5530040</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.3.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/a32d2b36c5679a16f776486913d7d2484cbc5225\"><code>a32d2b3</code></a> [pom] Bump junit to 5.7.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/8a312608f12616c7c2e1836bab4ad1826bcbc96b\"><code>8a31260</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/336\">#336</a> from hazendaz/spotbugs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/c9733e9bb4f4545a14e2bed2147f17f9e20d1ca6\"><code>c9733e9</code></a> [pom] Bump spotbugs to 4.3.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/92876e8d7091b4e5a572178807d835636add3294\"><code>92876e8</code></a> [pom] Remove old maven comment as we are now going to latest 3.8.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/8ebfd75f70571ebfffae7781dae3783547fba007\"><code>8ebfd75</code></a> [ci] Update since date as we switched to 4.3.x</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/e8e34a47e67119b44e0ce0a3c3869f23117ce59d\"><code>e8e34a4</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/334\">#334</a> from spotbugs/dependabot/maven/slf4jVersion-2.0.0-alpha2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/6891b9dba8e4462ef776a90b6dd56a2cee9a0dcc\"><code>6891b9d</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/311\">#311</a> from spotbugs/dependabot/maven/mavenVersion-3.8.1</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/1d7f14c4ff0d28f11b5714faac824d0f1a76e0a4\"><code>1d7f14c</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/312\">#312</a> from spotbugs/dependabot/maven/org.apache.maven-maven...</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/commit/7ba7755e1e80b20e766d22cacc8c4fd737d162ae\"><code>7ba7755</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/issues/335\">#335</a> from spotbugs/dependabot/maven/com.github.spotbugs-sp...</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/spotbugs/spotbugs-maven-plugin/compare/spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.1.3...spotbugs-maven-plugin-4.3.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=com.github.spotbugs:spotbugs-maven-plugin&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.1.3&new-version=4.3.0)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1687\">#1687</a>:](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1687\">junit-team/junit#1687</a>) Mark ThreadGroups created by FailOnTimeout as daemon groups</h3>\n<p>In JUnit 4.13 ([pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1517\">#1517</a>](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/pull/1517\">junit-team/junit4#1517</a>)) an attempt was\nmade to fix leakage of the <code>ThreadGroup</code> instances created when a test is run with a timeout. That\nchange explicitly destroyed the <code>ThreadGroup</code> that was created for the time-limited test. Numerous\npeople reported problems that were caused by explicitly destroying the <code>ThreadGroup</code>.</p>\n<p>In this change, the code was updated to call  <code>ThreadGroup.setDaemon(true)</code> instead of destroying the\nThreadGroup.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1691\">Pull request $1691:</a> Only create ThreadGroups if FailOnTimeout.lookForStuckThread is true.</h3>\n<p>In JUnit 4.12 ([pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/742\">#742</a>](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/pull/742\">junit-team/junit4#742</a>)) the <code>Timeout</code>\nRule was updated to optionally display the stacktrace of the thread that appears to be stuck\n(enabled on an opt-in basis by passing <code>true</code> to <code>Timeout.Builder.lookForStuckThread(boolean)</code>).\nWhen that change was made, time-limited tests were changed to start the new thread in a new\n<code>ThreadGroup</code>, even if the test did not call <code>lookForStuckThread()</code>. This subtle change in\nbehavior resulted in visible behavior changes to some tests (for example, tests of code that uses\n<code>java.beans.ThreadGroupContext</code>).</p>\n<p>In this change, the code is updated to only create a new <code>ThreadGroup</code> if the caller calls\n<code>Timeout.Builder.lookForStuckThread(true)</code>. Tests with timeouts that do not make this call will\nbehave as they did in JUnit 4.11 (and more similar to tests that do not have a timeout). This\nunfortunately could result in visible changes of tests written or updated since the 4.12\nrelease. If this change adversely affects your tests, you can create the <code>Timeout</code> rule via the\nbuilder and call <code>Timeout.Builder.lookForStuckThread(true)</code>.</p>\n<h1>Exceptions</h1>\n<h3>[Pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1654\">#1654</a>:](<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1654\">junit-team/junit#1654</a>) Fix for issue <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1192\">#1192</a>: NotSerializableException with AssumptionViolatedException</h3>\n<p>This change fixes an issue where <code>AssumptionViolatedException</code> instances could not be serialized\nif they were created with a constructor that takes in an <code>org.hamcrest.Matcher</code> instance (these\nconstructors are used if you use one of the <code>assumeThat()</code> methods in <code>org.junit.Assume</code>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/05fe2a64f59127c02135be22f416e91260d6ede6\"><code>05fe2a6</code></a> [maven-release-plugin] prepare release r4.13.2</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/ff57344f7171ea8b0935c4f842cacf1097266592\"><code>ff57344</code></a> Add build for JDK 17-ea</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/02aaa01b8f74c0eb496d76685ec49fddeb311087\"><code>02aaa01</code></a> Improve check that thread is stopped</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/e9a75f4be71a4d5a794ccd063522eea4b0f3194f\"><code>e9a75f4</code></a> Merge test for exception type and message</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/d27ad5259228e84c235dac24cd62f974ac0a8e1d\"><code>d27ad52</code></a> Rename DelegateStatement to DelegatingStatement</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/b83dc2e8c4ff06cf233cd347f1280bb417482985\"><code>b83dc2e</code></a> Better name for test that stops statement</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/527f3a3d0d71ad6dc66ede6f68f6fc316904ed2a\"><code>527f3a3</code></a> Replace InfiniteLoop with RunForASecond</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/2db63942882d91020b46d7333285e5c94f1d1e52\"><code>2db6394</code></a> Tidy up FailOnTimeoutTest</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/64634e1c3e357251a84278c26b73b04fc3450ea3\"><code>64634e1</code></a> Update 4.13.2 release notes to document pull 1654</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/commit/f8ee412316b1a94d3dc35498359cc2f0ca273216\"><code>f8ee412</code></a> Fix serialization of AssumptionViolatedException (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1654\">#1654</a>)</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/compare/r4.13...r4.13.2\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=junit:junit&package-manager=maven&previous-version=4.13&new-version=4.13.2)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-dependabot-security-updates#about-compatibility-scores)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

However, all contributed commits are already automatically signed-off.\n\n> The meaning of a signoff depends on the project, but it typically certifies that committer has the rights to submit this work under the same license and agrees to a Developer Certificate of Origin \n> (see [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/) for more information).\n>\n> \\- [Git Commit Signoff documentation](https://developercertificate.org/)\n\nIf signing your organization's CLA is a strict-requirement for merging this contribution, please feel free to close this PR.\n\n##
