specify the table directory\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nTo read the hudi table, you need to specify the path, but the path is not only the tablePath corresponding to the table, but needs to be determined by the partition directory structure. Different keyGenerators correspond to different partition directory structures. The first-level partition directory uses path=```.../table/*/*```, the secondary partition directory path=```.../table/*/*/*```ï¼Œso it is troublesome to let the user specify the data path, the user only needs to specify the tablePath:Â  ```.../table```\r\n\r\nAt the same time, after reading the hudi table by configuring path=```.../table```, it is more convenient to use sparksql to query the hudi table. You only need to add tabproperties to the hive table metadata: ```spark.sql.sources.provider= hudi```, you can automatically convert the hive table to the hudi table.\r\n\r\nIf the hive metadata tabproperties contains ```spark.sql.sources.provider=hudi```, the parsing process of sparksql reading the hive table is as followsï¼š\r\n\r\nfirst step\r\n[https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/62be2483d7d78e61fd2f77929cf41c76eff17869/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSourceStrategy.scala#L302]()\r\n\r\nSecond step\r\n[https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/62be2483d7d78e61fd2f77929cf41c76eff17869/sql/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/datasources/DataSourceStrategy.scala#L261]()\r\n\r\nThe ```resolveRelation``` in the second step will go directly to the DefaultSource of hudi, so reading the hive table is automatically converted to reading the hudi table\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change

https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently, In an ETL pipeline(eg, kafka -> hudi -> hive), If the process of hudi to hive failed, the job is still running.\r\nI think we can add a switch to control the job behavior(fail or keep running) when kafka to hudi is ok, while hudi to hive failed, leave the choice to user. since ingesting data to hudi and sync to hive is a complete task in some scenes.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n- Listing of metadata table timeline and files, happens just once during `HoodieTableMetadata` initialization, and either held in the driver or serialized to executors. So none of the metadata table listing happens from executors. and not more than once during a commit.\r\n- When timeline server is enabled (default), there is a single `HoodieTableMetadata` object that is held in the driver, each call will open/close the file slice. Results are cached in-memory like before, further improving performance\r\n- When timeline server is not enabled, then each task (indexing, writing..) will open/close the metadata table once per task. This trades off more RPC calls for network cost of moving large lists from driver to executors. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in checkstyle.xml*\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nFixed suboptimal implementation of a magic sequence search that may take days on the file sizes of a few megabytes.\r\nInstead of using 6 bytes buffer to find a magic sequence it uses a lot larger buffer that speeds up process like 170k times in some cases. The inefficiency is very noticeable when GCS or S3 storages are begin used.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nRewrote scanForNextAvailableBlockOffset function to use a large buffer size.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n Currently, if you want to set the partition of hudi, you must configure it with the parameter hoodie.datasource.write.partitionpath.field, but the Spark DataFrame api partitonBy does not take effect. We can automatically translate the parameter of partitionBy into the partition field of hudi.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n*(for example:)*\r\n  - *Modify AnnotationLocation checkstyle rule in

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThere are two issues w/ metadata listing feature for MOR table:\r\n \r\n- When restored, unsynced delta commits can be deleted, resulting in valid log files (which were part of the delta commit) to be not synced to metadata table. (missing files)\r\n- When rolling back a failed commit eagerly, rollback will add a log file B with the command block and the failed commit could have added a log file A (with potentially partial data). Now, since the commit never was completed, the log file A has no chance to be synced to the metadata table\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes both. \r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n  - Adds list of log files touched for a given rollback/restore to (rollback and restore) metadata which could be later synced with metadata table. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as TestHoodieBackedMetadata#testRollbackOperations\r\nTestHoodieBackedMetadata#testRollbackUnsyncedCommit\r\nTestHoodieBackedMetadata#testSync\r\n\r\n## Committer

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nIn HUDI-1510 we moved `HoodieEngineContext` so it can be used to parallelize fetching of partition paths from `FileSystemBackedMetadata` implementation. This PR actually uses it to do the parallelization.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we fix `HoodieTableMetadata` to create `HoodieBackedTableMetadata` or `FileSystemBackedTableMetadata` depending on whether metadata is enabled or not.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nEnhancements and fixes to test suite framework.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Added ClusteringNode to perform inline clustering\r\n- Added ValidateAsyncOperationsNode to perform hoodie dataset sanity checks like file versions, clean ups and archivals.\r\n- Added few yaml files to assist in test runs. (clustering, long running w/ validate async operation)\r\n- Added some extra configs:\r\n   validate_hive: optional config to include hive validation as part of ValidateDatasetNode\r\n   execute_itr_count: Some nodes need to be executed only in one off iterations with a long running job. For eg: do clustering at 25th iteration among 50 iterations, etc. \r\n   validate_archival: optional config to include to add archival validation in ValidateAsyncOperationsNode \r\n   validate_clean: optional config to include to add clean up validation in ValidateAsyncOperationsNode\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nManually ran test suite jobs to validate the changes.\r\n\r\n## Committer

- Introduced an internal metadata table, that stores file listings.\r\n - metadata table is kept upto date with\r\n - Fixed handling of CleanerPlan.\r\n - [HUDI-842] Reduce parallelism to speed up the test.\r\n - [HUDI-842] Implementation of CLI commands for metadata operations and lookups.\r\n - [HUDI-842] Extend rollback metadata to include the files which have been appended to.\r\n - [HUDI-842] Support for rollbacks in MOR Table.\r\n - MarkerBasedRollbackStrategy needs to correctly provide the list of files for which rollback blocks were appended.\r\n - [HUDI-842] Added unit test for rollback of partial commits (inflight but not completed yet).\r\n - [HUDI-842] Handled the error case where metadata update succeeds but dataset commit fails.\r\n - [HUDI-842] Schema evolution strategy for Metadata Table. Each type of metadata saved (FilesystemMetadata, ColumnIndexMetadata, etc.) will be a separate field with default null. The type of the record will identify the valid field. This way, we can grow the schema when new type of information is saved within in which still keeping it backward compatible.\r\n - [HUDI-842] Fix non-partitioned case and speedup initial creation of metadata table.Choose only 1 partition for jsc as the number of records is low (hundreds to thousands). There is more overhead of creating large number of partitions for JavaRDD and it slows down operations like WorkloadProfile.\r\nFor the non-partitioned case, use \".\" as the name of the partition to prevent empty keys in HFile.\r\n - [HUDI-842] Reworked metrics pusblishing.\r\n - Code has been split into reader and writer side. HoodieMetadata code to be accessed by using HoodieTable.metadata() to get instance of metdata for the table.\r\nCode is serializable to allow executors to use the functionality.\r\n - [RFC-15] Add metrics to track the time for each file system call.\r\n - [RFC-15] Added a distributed metrics registry for spark which can be used to collect metrics from executors. This helps create a stats dashboard which shows the metadata table improvements in real-time for production tables.\r\n - [HUDI-1321] Created HoodieMetadataConfig to specify configuration for the metadata table. This is safer than full-fledged properties for the metadata table (like HoodieWriteConfig) as it makes burdensome to tune the metadata. With limited configuration, we can control the performance of the metadata table closely.\r\n\r\n[HUDI-1319][RFC-15] Adding interfaces for HoodieMetadata, HoodieMetadataWriter (apache#2266)\r\n - moved MetadataReader to HoodieBackedTableMetadata, under the HoodieTableMetadata interface\r\n - moved MetadataWriter to HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter, under the HoodieTableMetadataWriter\r\n - Pulled all the metrics into HoodieMetadataMetrics\r\n - Writer now wraps the metadata, instead of extending it\r\n - New enum for MetadataPartitionType\r\n - Streamlined code flow inside HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter w.r.t initializing metadata state\r\n - [HUDI-1319] Make async operations work with metadata table (apache#2332)\r\n - Changes the syncing model to only move over completed instants on data timeline\r\n - Syncing happens postCommit and on writeClient initialization\r\n - Latest delta commit on the metadata table is sufficient as the watermark for data timeline archival\r\n - Cleaning/Compaction use a suffix to the last instant written to metadata table, such that we keep the 1-1\r\n - .. mapping between data and metadata timelines.\r\n - Got rid of a lot of the complexity around checking for valid commits during open of base/log files\r\n - Tests now use local FS, to simulate more failure scenarios\r\n - Some failure scenarios exposed HUDI-1434, which is needed for MOR to work correctly\r\n\r\nco-authored by: Vinoth Chandar <vinoth@apache.org>\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n* Add incremental timeline support to update pending clustering operations\r\n* Fix timeline to include information in inflight clustering operations\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n* Change timeline in filesystem views to include pending replacecommits (Previously it only included completed commits and pending compaction instants).\r\n* Because filesystem view includes pending clustering operations, change HoodieFileGroup#lastInstant to track only completed instants. Note that this required changing some assumption in TestUpgradeDowngrade tests, please take a close look.\r\n* Add incremental timeline support to refresh view based on pending clustering operations\r\n* Change replacecommit.inflight file also to include clustering plan (Previously only requested file has clustering plan). This is needed to block updates on file groups in pending clustering correctly. One disadvantage is replacecommit.inflight has sometimes avro and sometimes json (WorkloadProfile used by insert_overwrite) structure. So there is a hack needed to figure out if a inflight file is created by insert_overwrite or clustering. \r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any suggestions . \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests. See TestIncrementalFSViewSync.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is

*Tips*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix the Test case failure in TestHBaseIndex\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nThe `hadoopConf` used by `metaClient` are different from that `SparkRDDWriteClient` use in `TestHBaseIndex`. They may have different namenode port. This will result in the `SparkRDDWriteClient` operate on different local NameNode with `metaClient`. And a hoodie table not exists exception will throw out for test case in `TestHBaseIndex`.\r\nI fix this by reInit the `context`  with the `hadoopConf` in `TestHBaseIndex` to keep the conf consistent.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nDecode the partition value in HiveSyncTool if the URL_ENCODE_PARTITIONING_OPT_KEY set true. Because Hive itself will do escape processing on partition Value. Without this Decoding, the partition value will be encoded twice which lead to incorrect query result in hive or spark sql.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nDecode the partition value in HiveSyncTool if the URL_ENCODE_PARTITIONING_OPT_KEY set true. \r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n  - Added integration tests for in sparksql-incremental.commands\r\n \r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x ]

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a maven profile to support skipping shade sources jars. \r\nIt will help speeding up building process when you want to quickly deploy a snapshot or something.\r\n\r\nExample build command: `mvn clean package -DskipTests -DskipShadeSources`.\r\nIn our jenkins environment, it speeded up the building process from 30mins to 7mins. The former build was slow because some sources like `io.confluent:kafka-schema-registry-client:jar:3.0.0` was failed to fetch.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Add property `shadeSources` and maven profile `skipShadeSources` to control whether create sources jar in `maven-shade-plugin`\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ ] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [ ] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella

purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nThis implements reader side changes to ensure that all places in the Hudi code base that need to fetch all the partition paths for the Hudi table, it goes through the metadata table if it is present to avoid filesystem listings.\r\n\r\nIn general, the idea is to always go through the metadata table by default for the readers, and if it is not present default to the filesystem based listing.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x]

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\n1. Fixed a bug in schema compatibility check where some field types were not allowed.\r\n2. Some field types changes are allowed (e.g. int -> long) while maintaining schema backward compatibility within HUDI. The check was reversed with the reader schema being passed for the write schema.\r\n3. Also added a unit test to check for all the allowed field type changes.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests,

What is the purpose of the pull request\r\nWhen hudi-test-suite is reading records from the existing parquet files, it is using the reader schema (original schema used to write the parquet file).  Hudi writer core uses the evolved/latest writer schema when reading the existing parquet files.  (Difference is visible only when testing schema evolution, with an evolved schema).\r\n\r\nTo mimic the Hudi writer core behavior, with this change latest writer schema is used for reading the parquet files.\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n- Modified DFSHoodieDatasetInputReader, readParquetOrLogFiles() to use writer schema.\r\n- \r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as testSimpleHoodieDatasetReader().\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [ x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x ] Commit message is

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nCurrently every time an operation (i.e. commit, clean, rollback) completes we attempt to keep the metadata table up to date by creating an upsert on the metadata table with the same instant time. This way we can reference both datasets timelines and directly compare the instants on them to see if they are in sync. \r\n\r\nThere can be the possibility that the dataset timeline and the metadata table timeline become out of sync. When trying to read from the metadata table while the timeline is out of sync you would get incorrect values for `getAllFilesInPartition` and `getAllPartitionPaths`. \r\n\r\nThis change provides a way to overcome this scenario by reading unsynced timeline instants and merging it with existing metadata table records to get the most up to date state of the file system\r\n\r\nJIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1325\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\n#### Timeline Sync\r\n* The logic of converting timeline metadata to metadata table records was directly tied to the commit phase in `HoodieBackedMetadataWriter`. Refactored this logic to a utility class `HoodieTableMetadataTimelineUtil`\r\n* Created a scanner `HoodieMetadataMergedInstantRecordScanner` which handles conversion of timeline instants to metadata records and merges results\r\n* Added final step in `AbstractHoodieTableMetadata.getMergedRecordByKey` which uses the new scanner mentioned to fetch the `HoodieRecord` associated with the desired `key` from the unsynced timeline instants and merge it with the record from the metadata table\r\n* When converting rollback operation to metadata table records there was logic that re-read from the metadata table to ensure any files being deleted as part of roll back existed.\r\n```\r\n// Rollbacks deletes instants from timeline. The instant being rolled-back may not have been synced to the\r\n// metadata table. Hence, the deleted filed need to be checked against the metadata.\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't make sense since all instants are processed in serial order so there would never be the case where a rollback was being written before an instant earlier on the timeline was already synced. Removed this logic because it created circular dependency when implementing timeline merging\r\n* Changed the validate metadata step in tests to use the metadata reader `HoodieBackedTableMetadata`. By default when metadata writer `HoodieBackedTableMetadataWriter` is initialized it syncs all instants to the metadata table. By using the reader we can simulate metadata table being out of sync.\r\n* Modified `initMetaClient` in test base class to allow table type to be passed in since table type is always set as `COPY_ON_WRITE` if using this method to initialize the meta client\r\n\r\n#### Refactor\r\n\r\nFor the following reasons I modified the HoodieTableMetadata interface to be an AbstractHoodieMetadata class which contains the following shared functionality irresepective of how the metadata is stored  (as a Hoodie table, in some key/value store):\r\n* Fetching `getAllPartitions` and `getAllFileInPartition` from metadata should validate metadata flag is enabled and should default to file listing if any error occurs regardless of storage type\r\n* During `fetchAllPartitions` and `fetchAllFilesInPartition` metrics should be published on operations and if `validateLookUps` is enabled, results returned from metadata should be compared against actual file listing results regardless of what storage type is\r\n* In `getMergedRecordByKey` regardless of how the key is fetched from storage the result is merged against unsynced timeline instants. This is why I introduced abstract `getRecordByKeyFromMetadata` which can be implemented by inheriting class which contains logic specific to storage type.\r\n* Moved `findInstantsToSync` to `AbstractHoodieTableMetadata`. This method is needed regardless of storage type to find if metadata is in sync with timeline. However since how the last synced instant is stored can be dependent on storage type made this method `abstract`.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following options)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is a trivial rework / code cleanup without any test coverage.\r\n\r\n*(or)*\r\n\r\nThis pull request is already covered by existing tests, such as *(please describe tests)*.\r\n\r\n(or)\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nRan `TestHoodieBackedMetadata` which contains all tests related to metadata table\r\n\r\nAdded tests which use an unsynced client after commits, cleans, and restores have been performed to ensure updates not written to the metadata yet are still being reflected when reading

hoodie table schema\r\n\r\nadd test case\r\n\r\n## *Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nFix the bug when write  compatible data type to the hudi table, an exception throw out. For example when first write a double to the table, then write a int to the table, an exception throw out as the ISSUE [HUDI-1453] describe.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\nCurrently, Hudi will store the incoming record schema(we call it inputSchema here) in `HoodieWriteConfig`. In the write stage, Hoodie use the inputSchema to parse the incoming record and read&write record to the hoodie table.\r\n\r\nIn most case it works well.However when the incoming schema is compatible but not equal to the table schema(write a \"int\" to \"long\").It will throw an Exception in write stage as the ISSUE [HUDI-1453] describe. I fix this issue by distinguishing the two kind schemas(`inputSchema` and `tableSchema`). Here is the major change:\r\n\r\n1. Divide `writerSchema` into `inputSchema` and `tableSchema` in `HoodieWriteHandle`.The `inputSchema` is used for `getInsertValue` to parse the incoming record.And the `tableSchema` is used for read/write data in/to the table which is the schema of  the hoodie table.\r\n2. Change all references to `writerSchema` to `inputSchema` or `tableSchema`, according to the usage scenario. If parser the incoming record, we use the `inputSchema`. If we read/write data from the table, we use `tableSchema`. \r\n3. Add a `getTableSchema` method in `HoodieTable` to read the table schema. \r\n4. Refactoring the construct method for `HoodieWriteHandle`. Add an Option param to the construct method for `HoodieBootstrapHandle` to pass the specified schema.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n*(Please pick either of the following

- Changes the syncing model to only move over completed instants on data timeline\r\n - Syncing happens postCommit and on writeClient initialization\r\n - Latest delta commit on the metadata table is sufficient as the watermark for data timeline archival\r\n - Cleaning/Compaction use a suffix to the last instant written to metadata table, such that we keep the 1-1\r\n - .. mapping between data and metadata timelines.\r\n - Got rid of a lot of the complexity around checking for valid commits during open of base/log files\r\n - Tests now use local FS, to simulate more failure scenarios\r\n - Some

*Tips*\r\n- *Thank you very much for contributing to Apache Hudi.*\r\n- *Please review https://hudi.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull request.*\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the pull request\r\n\r\nRecently, we made Hudi support Spark 3.0.0: https://github.com/apache/hudi/pull/2208. However, there was a large refactor done to Spark datasource V2 API interfaces from version 2.4.4 â†’ 3.0.0. So currently our bulk insert v2(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HUDI-1013) feature is marked as unsupported with Spark3.\r\n\r\nWe need to redesign the bulk insert v2 part with datasource v2 api in Spark 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Brief change log\r\n\r\nCreate a new internal datasource ```org.apache.hudi.spark3.internal``` which implements bulk insert v2 with datasource v2 API in Spark 3.0.0.\r\n\r\nMost code are migrated from datasource ```org.apache.hudi.internal```.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\nThis change added tests and can be verified as follows:\r\n\r\n  - *Added two unit tests to verify the change.*\r\n\r\n## Committer checklist\r\n\r\n - [x] Has a corresponding JIRA in PR title & commit\r\n \r\n - [x] Commit message is descriptive of the change\r\n \r\n - [ ] CI is green\r\n\r\n - [ ] Necessary doc changes done or have another open PR\r\n       \r\n - [ ] For large changes, please consider breaking it into sub-tasks under an umbrella JIRA.","created_at":"2020-12-11T07:29:57Z","updated_at":"2020-12-25T14:43:35Z","closed_at":"2020-12-25T14:43:34Z","merged_at":"2020-12-25T14:43:34Z","merge_commit_sha":"286055ce34bdbbac68c995a2710fc7be07734b12","assignee":{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"nsivabalan","id":513218,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMzIxOA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/513218?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan","html_url":"https://github.com/nsivabalan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nsivabalan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/2328/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/2328/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/issues/2328/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/hudi/statuses/a7b5d803bba9bd59b0bb8974c672297c78074fa3","head":{"label":"zhedoubushishi:wenningd/bulk-insert-v2-4","ref":"wenningd/bulk-insert-v2-4","sha":"a7b5d803bba9bd59b0bb8974c672297c78074fa3","user":{"login":"zhedoubushishi","id":31263084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjYzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31263084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi","html_url":"https://github.com/zhedoubushishi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214349440,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNDk0NDA=","name":"hudi","full_name":"zhedoubushishi/hudi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhedoubushishi","id":31263084,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjYzMDg0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31263084?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi","html_url":"https://github.com/zhedoubushishi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhedoubushishi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com

This adds a new FileSystemView which can fetch the file listing using the Hudi backed metadata table.\r\n\r\n## Verify this pull request\r\n\r\n- Added unit test\r\n- Tested on EMR cluster\r\n\r\n##
