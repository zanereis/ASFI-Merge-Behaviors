moves the DAG bundle config into the Airflow config, instead of being in the db. This:\r\n\r\n- makes it much easier to configure a fresh Airflow instance - no api/cli calls required\r\n- avoids some security concerns by ensuring only deployment managers, with direct access to the instance, can configure these\r\n\r\nThe primary downside is this does mean you cannot reconfigure an existing bundle in a running Airflow

Handling `TIRescheduleStatePayload` in `ti_update_state` -> covered by unit test: `test_ti_update_state_to_reschedule`\r\n2. Defining a datamodel for TIRescheduleStatePayload and adding it to the discriminator: ti_state_discriminator\r\n\r\n### Client side changes (task sdk):\r\n\r\n#### HTTP client:\r\nAdded a new function defer that sends a patch request to the `task-instances/{id}/state execution` api with payload: `RescheduleTask`\r\n\r\n#### Comms:\r\nDefining a new data model to send a request to patch ti as \"up_for_reschedule\" from task runner to supervisor: `RescheduleTask`  (Added to ToSupervisor)\r\n\r\n#### Supervisor:\r\n1. Extended `handle_requests` to receive requests from task runner and forwarding the message to http client to call reschedule.\r\n\r\n#### TaskRunner:\r\nTask runner executes: ti.task.execute and raises `AirflowRescheduleException` for rescheduling. This sends a request to supervisor using `SUPERVISOR_COMMS`\r\n\r\nExample DAG with which this was tested:\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\r\nfrom airflow.exceptions import AirflowRescheduleException\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom airflow.utils import timezone\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag()\r\ndef reschedule_dag():\r\n    @task\r\n    def

PR adds support for [Google Cloud Vertex AI Feature Store synchronization](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/sync-data) operations in Apache Airflow. \r\n\r\n[Vertex AI Feature Store](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/featurestore/latest/overview) is a managed, cloud-native feature store service that's integral to Vertex AI. It streamlines your ML feature management and online serving processes by letting you manage your feature data in a BigQuery table or view. You can then serve features online directly from the BigQuery data source.\r\n\r\n## Components Added\r\n\r\n1. **SyncFeatureViewOperator**: Triggers synchronization of a feature view, updating online serving data from the batch source\r\n2. **GetFeatureViewSyncOperator**: Retrieves status and details of a feature view sync operation\r\n3. **FeatureViewSyncSensor**: Monitors the progress of feature view sync operations\r\n4. **FeatureStoreHook**: Core integration with the Vertex AI Feature Store API\r\n\r\n## Usage Example\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    sync_task = SyncFeatureViewOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"sync_task\",\r\n        project_id=PROJECT_ID,\r\n        location=REGION,\r\n        feature_online_store_id=FEATURE_ONLINE_STORE_ID,\r\n        feature_view_id=FEATURE_VIEW_ID,\r\n    )\r\n    wait_for_sync = FeatureViewSyncSensor(\r\n        task_id=\"wait_for_sync\",\r\n        location=REGION,\r\n        feature_view_sync_name=\"{{ task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='sync_task', key='return_value')}}\",\r\n        poke_interval=60,  # Check every minute\r\n        timeout=600,  # Timeout after 10 minutes\r\n        mode=\"reschedule\",\r\n    )\r\n    get_task = GetFeatureViewSyncOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"get_task\",\r\n        location=REGION,\r\n        feature_view_sync_name=\"{{ task_instance.xcom_pull(task_ids='sync_task', key='return_value')}}\",\r\n    )\r\n    sync_task >> wait_for_sync >> get_task\r\n```","created_at":"2024-12-12T20:10:32Z","updated_at":"2024-12-16T18:13:13Z","closed_at":"2024-12-16T18:13:13Z","merged_at":"2024-12-16T18:13:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"16022e008cc2eef122c5cd254cdb52d2c1b7e026","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1463392518,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDYzMzkyNTE4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/provider:google","name":"provider:google","color":"bfd4f2","default":false,"description":"Google

changes introduced here lets these existing classes serve \"double\" duty in\nthe execution time of TaskSDK and also the Parse Time in the DAG Processor\n(but the actual switch to use these will be a separate bigger PR).\n\nThere are a few warts left here, namely:\n\n- The default on `CommsDecoder`'s decoder argument is incorrect for\n  subclasses, we might fix that later to be more dynamic about the default.\n- The location of this code is not right for reuse in TaskSDK/execution time\n  and parse time. There is a bigger bit of work being planned to move this all\n  around before release of Airflow 3\n- Some of the functions on the base `WatchedSubprocess` class are TI specific\n  and maybe should be on a separate

However, since SQL parsing alone might not always provide all the details (e.g. in SQL query we can reference table only by table name, or dataset.table without the project_id), checks have been implemented to ensure accurate lineage. As a result CLL may not be included when there is uncertainty about its correctness.\r\n\r\nThere is another change not related to CLL: right now output table is duplicated into input tables. We are creating a list of input tables based on `referencedTables` property provided by Google and as it turns out, this also includes the destination table. So f.e. this query: \r\n`INSERT INTO `a.b.c` VALUES (1, \"a\", 23)`\r\n would return `a.b.c` as input table and output table.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes it by removing output table from input tables. I am not sure if it's a correct approach as sometimes users may write a query that performs a process that moves data from one table to the same table but i think this is rare and also this kind of lineage information (from A to A) does not provide much value. Please let me know if you think I'm wrong.\r\n\r\nI also refactored the mixin a bit to make it clearer and prepare for adding support for job types other than QUERY. I also change the class name - in the beginning it's supposed to be a general mixin, but BigQueryInsertJobOperator is so complex that this mixin will only be used with that class.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please

support to display XCom details for a task instance in a tab. Add a clipboard button next to the value so that user can copy the value easily. The PR also adds global XCom page under browse similar to Events page currently. \r\n\r\nNotes for review and self : \r\n\r\n1. Events page is at `src/pages/Events/` should I move this also to `src/pages/XCom` from current `airflow/ui/src/pages/TaskInstance/XCom` . I started with task instance and later realized it's easier to make this page global .\r\n2. Added `run_id` to the response for better filtering in retrieving value API in the global XCom page without any run id in the URL params.\r\n3. Each XCom entry needs an API call passing `stringify: true` to get the value. I have added a `skeleton` but is it possible to set some value to reuse the `Skeleton` from Table's component.\r\n4. Clipboard button was automatically generated from https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/components/clipboard . Do I need to move these to individual files or disable the warnings?\r\n5.

This allowed only `dict[str, str]` entries to be passed down to the API which lead to issues when running tests with DAGs like:\r\n```py\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nimport sys\r\nimport time\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nfrom airflow import DAG\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag(\r\n    # every minute on the 30-second mark\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n    tags=[],\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1),\r\n)\r\ndef hello_dag():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    ### TaskFlow API Tutorial Documentation\r\n    This is a simple data pipeline example which demonstrates the use of\r\n    the TaskFlow API using three simple tasks for Extract, Transform, and Load.\r\n    Documentation that goes along with the Airflow TaskFlow API tutorial is\r\n    located\r\n    [here](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial_taskflow_api.html)\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    @task()\r\n    def hello():\r\n        print(\"hello\")\r\n        time.sleep(3)\r\n        print(\"goodbye\")\r\n        print(\"err mesg\", file=sys.stderr)\r\n\r\n    hello()\r\n\r\n\r\nhello_dag()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the arguments such as `op_args` and `op_kwargs` for PythonOperator can be non str. So that leads to a conclusion that we should accept `str` keys but `JsonAble` values.\r\n\r\nSome points to note for reviewers:\r\n1. Type we store in the table: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/1eb683be3a79c80927e9af1e89dabb5e78ce3136/airflow/models/renderedtifields.py#L76. Hence we should be able to accept any JsonAble types and store them, for non JsonAble ones like tuple and set, we should convert them and do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What does this PR change?\r\n- Get rid of the `RTIFPayload` and consume the payload directly in the api handler.\r\n- Handling special case of `tuples` - they are json serialisable but we used to store them as lists when passed as tuples, because of usage of json.dumps(). It has been made like this now:\r\n```\r\n    def is_jsonable(x):\r\n        try:\r\n            json.dumps(x)\r\n            if isinstance(x, tuple):\r\n                # Tuple is converted to list in json.dumps\r\n                # so while it is jsonable, it changes the type which might be a surprise\r\n                # for the user, so instead we return False here -- which will convert it to string\r\n                return False\r\n```\r\n- Reusing `serialize_template_field` from `airflow.serialization.helpers` because copy pasting code will be expensive, hard to maintain. We will revisit it anyways when we port the logic of templating to TASK SDK. Discussion: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44843/files#r1882834039\r\n- Added test cases with different scopes and different types to handle different cases of templated_fields well.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\nRead the **[Pull Request

2010(!) sqlite has had a WAL, or Write-Ahead Log mode of journalling\nwhich allos multiple concurrent readers and one writer. More than good enough\nfor us for \"local\" use.\n\nThe primary driver for this change was a realisation that it is possible and\nto reduce the amount of code in complexity in DagProcessorManager before\nreworking it for AIP-72 support :- we have a lot of code in the\nDagProcessorManager to support `if async_mode` that makes understanding the\nflow complex.\n\nSome useful docs and articles about this mode:\n\n- [The offical docs](https://sqlite.org/wal.html)\n- [Simon Willison's TIL](https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite/enabling-wal-mode)\n- [fly.io article about scaling read concurrency](https://fly.io/blog/sqlite-internals-wal/)\n\nThis still keeps the warning against using SQLite in production, but it\ngreatly reduces the restrictions what combos and settings can use this. In\nshort, when using an SQLite db it is now possible to:\n\n- use LocalExecutor, including with more than 1 concurrent worker slot\n- have multiple DAG parsing processes (even before AIP-72/TaskSDK changes to\n  that)\n\nWe execute the `PRAGMA journal_mode` every time we connect, which is more\noften that is strictly needed as this is one of the few modes thatis\npersistent and a property of the DB file just for ease and to ensure that it\nit is in the mode we want.\n\nI have tested this with `breeze -b sqlite start_airflow` and a kicking off a\nlot of tasks concurrently.\n\nWill this be without problems? No, not entirely, but due to the\nscheduler+webserver+api server process we've _already_ got the case where\nmultiple processes are operating on the DB file.

Why this change\r\nIn AIP-74, we introduce a new \"name\" column to the Asset. We do not expect to have assets with the same name or URI. For example, `Asset(name=\"test-name\", uri=\"test://asset\")` and `Asset(\"test-name\")` would be considered assets that violate this rule.\r\n\r\n> Similar to how Dataset works, an asset can be declared by instantiating an Asset object. One difference from Dataset is that Asset will have an additional name argument. If given, this must be unique in the Airflow deployment, and is used to represent the asset in user-facing interfaces,\r\n\r\nCurrently, we do nothing when a task has an unexpected asset as an inlet or outlet. The following example works fine now, even though it should not.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom airflow.sdk.definitions.asset import Asset\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag(\r\n    start_date=None,\r\n    schedule=None,\r\n    catchup=False,\r\n)\r\ndef my_producer_dag():\r\n    @task(\r\n    \tinlets=[\r\n    \t\t# name=\"test\", uri=\"\"s3://my-bucket/my-key/\"\r\n    \t\tAsset(\"test\", \"s3://my-bucket/my-key/\")\r\n    \t],\r\n    \toutlets=[\r\n    \t\t# name=\"s3://my-bucket/my-key/\", uri=\"\"s3://my-bucket/my-key/\"\r\n    \t\tAsset(\"s3://my-bucket/my-key/\") \r\n    \t]\r\n    )\r\n    def my_producer_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    my_producer_task()\r\n\r\n\r\nmy_producer_dag()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBack to https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/42612, we introduced the concept of AssetActive. These assets that are classified as inactive. While the first asset can still be activated, subsequent assets will not be activated. For example, if `Asset(\"test\", \"s3://my-bucket/my-key/\")` is activated first, then `Asset(\"s3://my-bucket/my-key/\")` will not be activated. This rule applies even if the assets are defined in different DAGs or in separate files.\r\n\r\n## What's the change\r\nThe activation status of an asset has already been addressed in previous pull requests. In this pull request, we have implemented a task that checks for any inactive assets in the outlets or inlets. If any inactive assets are found, it raises an `AirflowExecuteWithInactiveAssetException`, which inherits from `AirflowFailException`, causing the task to fail.\r\n\r\nCloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44600\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n\r\nTested with the following test cases. All of them worked fine before this fix and received a similar error message to the screenshot below after this fix.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Inactive assets in inlets</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom airflow.sdk.definitions.asset import Asset\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag(start_date=None, schedule=None, catchup=False)\r\ndef inactive_assets_in_inlets_dag():\r\n    @task(\r\n        inlets=[\r\n            Asset(\"inlet-test\", \"s3://inlet/my-key/\"),\r\n            Asset(\"s3://inlet/my-key/\"),\r\n            Asset(\"inlet-test2\"),\r\n        ],\r\n    )\r\n    def first_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    @task(inlets=[Asset(uri=\"inlet-test2\")])\r\n    def second_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    first_asset_task() >> second_asset_task()\r\n\r\n\r\ninactive_assets_in_inlets_dag()\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Inactive assets in outlets</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom airflow.sdk.definitions.asset import Asset\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag(start_date=None, schedule=None, catchup=False)\r\ndef inactive_assets_in_outlets_dag():\r\n    @task(\r\n        outlets=[\r\n            Asset(\"outlet-test\", \"s3://outlet/my-key/\"),\r\n            Asset(\"s3://outlet/my-key/\"),\r\n            Asset(\"outlet-test-2\"),\r\n        ],\r\n    )\r\n    def first_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    @task(outlets=[Asset(uri=\"outlet-test-2\")])\r\n    def second_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    first_asset_task() >> second_asset_task()\r\n\r\n\r\ninactive_assets_in_outlets_dag()\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Inactive assets mixed in inlets and outlets</summary>\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom airflow.sdk.definitions.asset import Asset\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag(start_date=None, schedule=None, catchup=False)\r\ndef inactive_assets_mixed_in_inlets_outlet_dag():\r\n    @task(\r\n        inlets=[\r\n            Asset(\"test\", \"s3://my-bucket/my-key/\"),\r\n        ],\r\n        outlets=[Asset(\"test2\")],\r\n    )\r\n    def first_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    @task(\r\n        inlets=[\r\n            Asset(uri=\"test2\"),\r\n        ],\r\n        outlets=[\r\n            Asset(\"s3://my-bucket/my-key/\"),\r\n        ],\r\n    )\r\n    def second_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    first_asset_task() >> second_asset_task()\r\n\r\n\r\ninactive_assets_mixed_in_inlets_outlet_dag()\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary>Inactive assets cross files</summary>\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom airflow.sdk.definitions.asset import Asset\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag(start_date=None, schedule=None, catchup=False)\r\ndef inactive_active_cross_file_dag_1():\r\n    @task(inlets=[Asset(\"cross\", \"s3://cross/my-key/\")])\r\n    def first_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    @task(outlets=[Asset(\"cross2\", \"s3://cross2/my-key/\")])\r\n    def second_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    first_asset_task() >> second_asset_task()\r\n\r\n\r\ninactive_active_cross_file_dag_1()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom __future__ import annotations\r\n\r\nfrom airflow.decorators import dag, task\r\nfrom airflow.sdk.definitions.asset import Asset\r\n\r\n\r\n@dag(start_date=None, schedule=None, catchup=False)\r\ndef inactive_active_cross_file_dag_2():\r\n    @task(inlets=[Asset(\"s3://cross2/my-key/\")])\r\n    def first_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    @task(outlets=[Asset(\"cross\")])\r\n    def second_asset_task():\r\n        pass\r\n\r\n    first_asset_task() >> second_asset_task()\r\n\r\n\r\ninactive_active_cross_file_dag_2()\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Licensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one\r\n or more contributor license agreements.

At this moment the paginated SQL query can be customized through the paginated_sql_statement_format parameter.  The read size can be specified through the page_size parameter, maybe another (better) name could be preferred here but that I let you guy's decide how it's best named.  If no page_size is specified, then the original implementation is used and everything is read and persisted in one go.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, I've moved the test code to test deferrable operators out of the microsoft azure provider and put it into the common test utils, so it can be re-used across multiple modules.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please keep an empty line above the dashes. -->\r\n---\r\n**^ Add

Please make sure that your code changes\r\nare covered with tests. And in case of new features or big changes\r\nremember to adjust the documentation.\r\n\r\nFeel free to ping committers for the review!\r\n\r\nIn case of an existing issue, reference it using one of the following:\r\n\r\ncloses: #ISSUE\r\nrelated: #ISSUE\r\n\r\nHow to write a good git commit message:\r\nhttp://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/\r\n-->\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/apache/airflow/issues/44805\r\nDependent on https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44786\r\n\r\n### Why is it needed?\r\nEvery time when we port the different TI state handling in the task runner, it is usually followed by an integration test of sorts to test the end to end flow of whether that state is testable or not. For example:\r\n1. For skipped state, we use the DAG https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44786/files#diff-cabbddd33130ce1a769412f5fc55dd23e4af4d0fa75f8981689daae769e0680dR1 and we test using the UT in task runner: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44786/files#diff-413c3c59636a3c7b41b8bb822827d18a959778d0b6331532e0db175c829dbfd2R141-R161\r\n2. For deferred state, we use the DAG: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44241/files#diff-2152ed5392424771e27a69173b3c18caae717939719df8f5dbbbdfee5f9efd9bR1 and test it using UT in task runner: https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/44241/files#diff-413c3c59636a3c7b41b8bb822827d18a959778d0b6331532e0db175c829dbfd2R93-R127\r\n\r\nDue to this, when new ti states are added or tests for that matter, it eventually leads to a huge folder with DAGs under `task_sdk/tests/dags` which could soon get ever growing and unmanageable. \r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nThe solution is in two parts:\r\n1. The first part would be the ability to create dynamic or in line dags which has been implemented using a DAGFactory kind of function:\r\n```\r\ndef get_inline_dag(dag_id: str, tasks: BaseOperator) -> DAG:\r\n    dag = DAG(\r\n        dag_id=dag_id,\r\n        default_args={\"start_date\": timezone.datetime(2024, 12, 3)},\r\n    )\r\n    setattr(tasks, \"dag\", dag)\r\n\r\n    return dag\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis function is capable of accepting `one` task as of now and creating a DAG out of it and returning the DAG object which should suffice our current testing needs, if there is a need, we can extend this function to support more than one tasks and their relationships.\r\nUsage:\r\n```\r\n    task = PythonOperator(\r\n        task_id=\"skip\",\r\n        python_callable=lambda: (_ for _ in ()).throw(\r\n            AirflowSkipException(\"This task is being skipped intentionally.\"),\r\n        ),\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    dag = get_inline_dag(\"basic_skipped\", task)\r\n```\r\nThe usage is as simple as creating any task from any operator and passing it down to this function.\r\n\r\n2. Mocking the parse function using KGB spy_agency: https://pypi.org/project/kgb/\r\nThe idea here is to use a spy agency to substitute out the `parse` function with a mock parser that does a bare minimum of the actual parser. We choose spy_agency over the mock library for two reasons primarily:\r\na) With `spy_agency`, you can mock specific methods or functions without affecting the entire class or module.\r\nb) Minimal dispruption and ease of use.\r\n\r\n### What is done so far?\r\n1. Replaced usage of all \"actual\" dags with in line dags in task runner tests which either do parsing or run.\r\n2. Deleted two DAGs\r\n3. Cannot remove the other two DAGs as they are tied to test_supervisor.py tests which use the DAG path as of now. Can be taken in a follow up if needed. Example:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01baa82a-7b43-4ff1-bc7e-c2fc20cef50d)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Impact\r\n1. No need to create any more DAG files for integration tests for task runner, which could be frequent with current development rate for AIP 72.\r\n2. Ability to easily create in line DAGs.\r\n\r\n#### Examples:\r\nBasic DAG\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf7a94b5-6c4c-4103-99a0-32047207a9b2)\r\n\r\ndeferred

This enhancement allows users to specify a custom Data Catalog ID when interacting with AWS Glue services.\r\n\r\n*Changes:*\r\n\r\n- Added optional catalog_id parameter to get_partitions, get_table, get_partition, and create_partition\r\n- Maintained backward compatibility (CatalogId defaults to None)\r\n- Added comprehensive test coverage for both with/without CatalogId scenarios\r\n\r\n*Testing
