Overview\r\n\r\nThis patch causes the indexing subsystem to use snapshot isolation when reading from the database. This reduces commit conflicts and ensures the index can make progress even in the case of frequently updated docs.\r\n\r\nIn the pathological case, a document updated in a fast loop can cause the indexer to stall out entirely when using serializable reads. Each successful update of the doc will cause the indexer to fail to commit if it processed that document. The indexer will retry with a new GRV but the same target DbSeq. In the meantime, our frequently updated document will have advanced beyond `DbSeq` and so the indexer will finish its job without indexing the document at all. This process can be repeated ad infinitum and the document will never actually show up in a view response.\r\n\r\nSnapshot reads are safe for this use case precisely because we do have the _changes feed, which guarantees that a concurrent doc update will show up again later in the feed.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I'm not entirely happy with the API for changing the isolation level on reads. It seems designed to run an entire transaction at a single isolation level, where I think we often want to be more selectively about modifying isolation levels within a transaction. But I didn't bother suggesting any changes on that front in this PR.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI posted a rudimentary Python script in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/kocolosk/6a4410b3ee8c6c06ed8d86deb6c76f19). It updates a single document in a loop and tries to run that document through an expensive `map` function. Running this script against `main` should show you the view almost never makes progress; every once in a while it might win the race, but most of the time it is returning a response that does not include recent updates to the document.\r\n\r\nRunning the script against this branch should show the view essentially keeping up, although the included document will still be a few revisions ahead.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nSee #3391 for work to make the included doc version consistent with the version observed by the view index function.\r\n\r\n##

Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

Overview\r\n\r\nPreviously, if a JWT claim was present, it was validated regardless of\r\nwhether it was required.\r\n\r\nHowever, [according to the spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-4):\r\n\r\n> all claims that are not understood by implementations MUST be ignored\r\n\r\nwhich we interpret to mean that we should not attempt to validate\r\nclaims we don't require.\r\n\r\nWith this change, only claims listed in required checks are validated.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it

indexer saves both the GRV it used during the view update, and\r\nthe committed versionstamp in the couch_jobs job data section. Then,\r\nthe view reader uses those versionstamps to emit a consistent snapshot\r\nof the view.\r\n\r\n  * The committed versionstamp ensures that the view results can be\r\n    emitted even if the view gets updated between the time the view\r\n    finished and the reader gets notified.\r\n\r\n  * The indexer GRV ensures that the view will emit the same doc\r\n    revisions in case when include_docs=true option is used as what it\r\n    read during the time it indexed the data.\r\n\r\nThe view reader uses those two versionstamps only if it initiates the\r\nview build itself and then waits for it to build, to ensure that it\r\ndoesn't operate on stale GRVs.\r\n\r\nBecause the committed version is only available after the main\r\ntransaction commits, during view indexing finalization there is now a\r\nseparate transaction which runs at the end which reads the committed\r\nversion then marks the view as `finished`.\r\n\r\nSince included docs have to be read at the indexer's GRV version, and,\r\nthat version is different than the committed version, those documents\r\nare loaded in from a separate process.\r\n\r\nThere are a few complications introduced by this commit:\r\n\r\n   * The versionstamps, especially the indexer GRV ones, may become\r\n     stale (older than 5 seconds) quickly and start throwing 1007\r\n     (transaction_too_old) errors. This could be mitigated by forcing\r\n     the indexer to commit after a shorter interval (1-2 seconds).\r\n\r\n   * There is some fragility introduced in respect to how included\r\n     docs are loaded in a separate process. When that crashes or does\r\n     timeout it maybe throw a new type of un-expected error that we\r\n     don't catch properly.\r\n\r\nFor this to properly work it needs at least two more updates:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/2e40063aae17658138bfaffa2304b5e461e43e30\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/commit/dbbab649dc5cbca50664ab3f7c33147e6010a106\r\n\r\nIssue:

Overview\r\n\r\nThis PR started as a port of https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3031 (Clean up logs) into 3.x branch. The main goal of the PR is to remove sensitive data from the logs.\r\nHowever as it was pointed out by reviewers it might be not the right approach to convert shape of gen_server state for a CouchDB version which is already widely deployed. Another problem with the scope of the PR is lack of definition of sensitive data. There are multiple points of view on the sensitive data:\r\n\r\n- user credentials\r\n- user documents\r\n- design documents \r\n\r\nThis means that there is no generic solution which would fit all. In order to solve this problem for the purposes of this PR the sensitive data are defined as \"user credentials\". \r\n\r\nBefore going further down with description of the solution presented in the PR. I wanted to mention the requirements as I understood them:\r\n\r\n1) `sys:get_status/1` should return state as is (wrapped in `[{data, [{\"State\", Term}]}]`) see http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_server.html#Module:format_status-2\r\n2) the `couch_log_formatter` should be able to call a configurable sanitizer module which would deal with changing the shape of log entries and removing user's data from terms\r\n3) \"user credentials\" should be removed from state for both `sys:get_status/1` use case and termination of a process.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve 1) we need to handle `:format_status(normal, ...)` and `:format_status(terminate, ...)` differently.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve 2) we need to pass the callback module name so it is available in `couch_log_formatter`. We also pass the process dictionary so sanitizer module could get some meta information about the process (for example tracing span_id). The process dictionary is not logged by default. However sanitizer module can include elements from process dictionary in a term it returns. \r\n\r\nThe approach to `format_status/2` is to return term as is when first argument is `normal` in order for `sys:get_status` to return original term. In both cases we remove \"sensitive data\" before returning the term from `format_status/2`. The `terminate` clause of a `format_status/2` returns `{Term, Ctx :: map()}`. The `Ctx` includes `module` and `dictionary` keys for now. We need this information so sanitizer could distinguish messages coming from different gen_servers.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make eunit`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nThis defines a configuration file which specifies sections and fields\r\nfor config values that are redacted from logs. Specifically, all\r\nvalues from the \"admins\" section and the value of \"password\" in the\r\n\"replicator\" section are redacted.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please give a short brief for the pull request,\r\n     what problem it solves or how it makes things better. -->\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nThis must be tested with its companion PR below.\r\n\r\nIn a remsh, set an admin password: `config:set(\"admins\", \"admin1\", \"secretpassword\").`, and then reload: `config:reload().` and you should see the following redactions in the log:\r\n```\r\n[notice] 2021-02-20T06:16:30.672944Z node1@127.0.0.1 <0.196.0> -------- config: [admins] admin1 set to '****' for reason nil\r\n[notice] 2021-02-20T06:17:13.720003Z node1@127.0.0.1 <0.196.0> -------- Reload detected config change admins.admin1 = '****'\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb-config/pull/35\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put links to those issues or pull requests here.  -->\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nDuring `POST` on `/{db}/_changes` with a custom filter, nodes attempt to [read the request payload](https://github.com/apache/couchdb/blob/3.x/src/couch/src/couch_changes.erl#L241), unless the request body already stored on a request record. When this is happening on a node foreign to the original http request, reader process quits with `exit:normal` and as a result the whole fabric request hangs until a timeout.\r\n\r\nThis patch switches filter reader to `chttpd_external:json_req_obj/2` for more descriptive exit message, adds reading of the payload on the request handler and validates that payload, when present, is a proper JSON object.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nRelated tests been added to the elixir tests\r\n\r\n`make elixir tests=test/elixir/test/changes_test.exs`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nPort https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3031 (Clean up logs) into 3.x branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR deals with cleaning up logs from user's data (potentially sensitive) in the cases when OTP processes crash. All commits except \"Add format_status/2 callback in gen_server implementations\" were cherry picked from https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3031. The \"Add format_status/2 callback in gen_server implementations\" was extended to include applications relevant for 3.x.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI tested it by running test suite and by comparing logs before and after. I did use following query to reduce noise.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfind src/ -name couch.log | xargs -I '{}' cat '{}' | grep error | grep -v 'No Admin Account configured' | grep -v 'no_db_file' | grep -v 'no such file' | grep -v 'Request to create N=' | grep -v 'ddoc_cache_ev :: ' | grep -v '\"error\":\"not_found\"' | grep -v 'httpd 404' | grep -v boom | grep -v bam | grep -v forbidden | grep -v request_body_too | grep -v xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx | grep -v 'http 405' | grep -v method_not_allowed | grep -v db_not_found | grep -v 'source missing' | grep -v missing_source | grep -v 'list of tags' | grep -v 'Failed to set security object on' | grep -v 'fabric_rpc:group_info/2 exit:{killed,' | grep -v 'mem3_reshard db monitor' | grep -v unauthorized | grep -v too_large | grep -v 'httpd 413' | grep -v 'httpd 405' | grep -v not_acceptable | grep -v 'httpd [0-9]*' | grep -v 'unsupported encoding' | grep -v content_md5_mismatch | grep -v changes_req_failed | grep -v 'ignoring document with empty ID' | grep -v 'some_id <<\"fail\">>' | grep -v query_parse_error | grep -v 'Db was deleted' | grep -v kapow | grep -v bad_content_type | grep -v 'purge-test-stuff' | grep -v '{file,\"src/couch_native_process.erl\"},{line,258}' | grep -v 'file already exists' | grep -v 'Expression does not eval' | grep -v 'Transient job' | grep -v 'mem3_reshard_job cleaning' | grep -v 'mem3_reshard_job source' | grep -v 'Purge checkpoin' | grep -v 'missing_target' | grep -v 'target db missing'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did run `make eunit` on vanilla 3.x branch and redirected the output of the above query into a file `3.x.vanilla.log`. Then I did remove all `couch.log` files and switched to `clean-up-logs-3.x` branch and repeated the process. The result is saved in `3.x.updated.log`. I did compare two files manually.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3031\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works

share replication scheduler allows configuring job priorities\r\nper-replicator db.\r\n\r\nPreviously jobs from all the replication dbs would be added to the scheduler\r\nand run in a round-robin order. This update makes it possible to specify the\r\nrelative priority of jobs from different databases. For example, there could be\r\nlow, high and default priority _replicator dbs.\r\n\r\nThe original algorithm comes from the [A Fair Share\r\nScheduler](https://proteusmaster.urcf.drexel.edu/urcfwiki/images/KayLauderFairShare.pdf\r\n\"Fair Share Scheduler\") paper by Judy Kay and Piers Lauder. A summary of how\r\nthe algorithm works is included in the top level comment in the\r\n`couch_replicator_share` module.\r\n\r\nThere is minimal modification to the main scheduler logic. Besides the\r\nshare accounting logic each cycle, the other changes are:\r\n\r\n  * Running and stopping candidates are now picked based on the priority first,\r\n    and then on their last_started timestamp.\r\n\r\n  * When jobs finish executing mid-cycle, their charges are accounted for. That\r\n    holds for jobs which terminate normally, are removed by the user, or crash.\r\n\r\nOther interesting aspects are the interaction with the error back-off mechanism\r\nand how one-shot replications are treated:\r\n\r\n  * The exponential error back-off mechanism is unaltered and takes precedence\r\n  over the priority values. That means unhealthy jobs are rejected and\r\n  \"penalized\" before the priority value is even looked at.\r\n\r\n  * One-shot replications, once started, are not stopped during each scheduling\r\n  cycle unless the operator manually adjusts the `max_jobs` parameter. That\r\n  behavior is necessary to preserve the \"snapshot\" semantics and is retained in\r\n  this update.\r\n","created_at":"2021-02-08T20:43:25Z","updated_at":"2021-03-11T18:13:06Z","closed_at":"2021-03-11T18:13:04Z","merged_at":"2021-03-11T18:13:04Z","merge_commit_sha":"1add5348697056ea7e9163b04696fe9d316e3e62","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3364/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/3364/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/issues/3364/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/couchdb/statuses/7ad40ffe653db19c702dcb6192f313fa40bced3b","head":{"label":"apache:fair-share-scheduler-3.x","ref":"fair-share-scheduler-3.x","sha":"7ad40ffe653db19c702dcb6192f313fa40bced3b","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":206417,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMDY0MTc=","name":"couchdb","full_name":"apache/couchdb","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/couchdb","description":"Seamless

Overview\r\n\r\nInstead of returning the stack trace in HTTP response we would want to log it and return a `{\"ref\": stack_hash(Stack)}`.\r\nIt is implemented already, but there are an unhandled edge case to get 'ERROR', fixed in chttpd.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI can reproduce to get some leaking information before the fix, with the following steps:\r\n\r\nCreate an empty database and add 2 new documents\r\nTo get an error, just delete some data from shard files.\r\n\r\nWhen I deleted just a few bytes (few hundreds of bytes) was not enough to stable get an error, the system seems to be so robust in case of filesystem based corruptions. \r\n\r\nI used this small script to truncate shard files:\r\n```\r\nTODO: fdbcli\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the script, keeps only first 1000 bytes of every related shard files.\r\n\r\nAfter truncate shards, I send a simple query:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% curl -u adm:pass http://127.0.0.1:15984/testdb/_all_docs | jq\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": \"badmatch\",\r\n  \"reason\": \"{'EXIT',{{badmatch,eof},\\n         [{couch_file,read_raw_iolist_int,3,\\n\r\n                    [{file,\\\"src/couch_file.erl\\\"},{line,714}]},\\n          {couch_file,handle_call,3,\r\n                    [{file,\\\"src/couch_file.erl\\\"},{line,493}]},\\n          {gen_server,try_handle_call,4\r\n                    [{file,\\\"gen_server.erl\\\"},{line,661}]},\\n          {gen_server,handle_msg,6,\r\n                    [{file,\\\"gen_server.erl\\\"},{line,690}]},\\n          {proc_lib,init_p_do_apply,3,\r\n                    [{file,\\\"proc_lib.erl\\\"},{line,249}]}]}}\",\r\n  \"ref\": 774065757\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix the response should looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% curl -u adm:pass http://127.0.0.1:15984/testdb/_all_docs | jq\r\n{\r\n  \"error\": \"unknown_error\",\r\n  \"reason\": \"eof\",\r\n  \"ref\": 3189254621\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull

Overview\r\n\r\nThis creates a development environment with a FoundationDB server and a CouchDB layer in two containers, sharing a network through Docker Compose.\r\n\r\nIt uses the FDB image published to Docker Hub for the FDB container, and downloads the FDB client packages from foundationdb.org to provide the development headers and libraries. www.foundationdb.org is actually not trusted in Debian Buster by default, so we have to download the GeoTrust_Global_CA.pem. The following link has more details:\r\n\r\nhttps://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=962596\r\n\r\nOnce the Docker Compose setup is running, VS Code executes the `create_cluster_file.bash` script to write down a cluster file containing the IP address in the compose network where the FDB service can be found. This cluster file is used both for a user-driven invocation of `./dev/run`, as well as for unit tests that require a running CouchDB.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I've got a small fix to the Makefile that corrects the approach used to running eunit tests with multiple apps specified on the command line to match the behavior of `make eunit` without any arguments.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nIf you have VS Code with the \"Remote - Containers\" extension installed, opening the CouchDB repo should cause the editor to offer to start the development container. The container will include all the dependences necessary to\r\n\r\n- build CouchDB using ./configure; make\r\n- run the full test suite\r\n- build the documentation\r\n- build Fauxton\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n#3336 added a container configuration for 3.x. This one is a step more involved because of the use of Docker Compose with a separate FDB container.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n(No code changes here, just a quicker Getting Started experience)\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A

Overview\r\n\r\nThis patch introduces an escript that generates an Erlang .boot script to start CouchDB using the in-place .beam files produced by the compile phase of the build. This allows us to radically simplify the boot process for dev nodes as Erlang computes the optimal order for loading the necessary modules, and the previous logic in `boot_node` was, well, _not_ optimal 😄 \r\n    \r\nIn addition to the simplification this approach offers a nice startup time speedup, at least when working inside a container environment. In my test with the stock .devcontainer it reduces startup time from about 75 seconds down to under 5 seconds 🚀 \r\n\r\nI had initially introduced a new `devnode` target in the Makefile but figured just invoking the script if the `devnode.boot` file is missing would be sufficient. Note that this file can become outdated on the following conditions:\r\n\r\n- Change in Erlang version \r\n- A new application is introduced to the source tree\r\n- Modules are removed from existing applications\r\n\r\nIn each case running `make clean` or simply deleting the `devnode.boot` file will fix it. We could generate it every time but I figured it was maybe overkill for infrequent occurrences, and `make clean` is an easy fix.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nStart a dev node with `./dev/run`. Try doing this after a `make clean; make` cycle and you should see a ~5 second delay during \"Ensure Erlang boot script exists\". Subsequent runs should be instantaneous at that step.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories please put

Thank you for your contribution!\r\n\r\n     Please file this form by replacing the Markdown comments\r\n     with your text. If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed. Once there are no objections, the PR can be merged by a\r\n     CouchDB committer.\r\n\r\n     See: http://couchdb.apache.org/bylaws.html#decisions for more info. -->\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nIf a mango query exceeds the 5 seconds for a transaction it sends a nasty error:\r\n```\r\n89e90f4c55 req_err(2721591552) erlfdb_error : 1031\r\n    [<<\"erlfdb_nif:erlfdb_future_get/1\">>,<<\"erlfdb:do_transaction/2 L686\">>,<<\"fabric2_fdb:do_transaction/2 L171\">>,<<\"fabric2_fdb:transactional/2 L142\">>,<<\"mango_cursor_view:execute/3 L142\">>,<<\"mango_httpd:handle_find_req/2 L197\">>,<<\"mango_httpd:handle_req/2 L37\">>,<<\"chttpd:handle_req_after_auth/2 L330\">>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis cleans that up and adds a better error. We also remove the `{restart_tx, true}` for a mango query that uses `_all_docs` to make it consistent with a mango query that uses a view.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple

Overview\r\n\r\nWhile CouchDB itself never responds with a 408 Request Timeout it is possible for a proxy to do so. The CouchDB Replicator treats a 408 as a permanent error, increments doc_write_failures, and keeps going. This is undesirable. This patch reorders the clauses in couch_replicator_httpc so we can easily treat a 408 the same way we treat any 5xx code (by retrying).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n## Related

Overview\r\n\r\nWhile CouchDB itself never responds with a 408 Request Timeout it is possible for a proxy to do so. The CouchDB Replicator treats a 408 as a permanent error, increments doc_write_failures, and keeps going. This is undesirable. This patch reorders the clauses in couch_replicator_httpc so we can easily treat a 408 the same way we treat any 5xx code (by retrying).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n## Related

Overview\r\n\r\nNew `elixir-suite` Makefile target is added. It runs a predefined set of elixir\r\nintegration tests.\r\n\r\nThe feature is controlled by two files:\r\n- test/elixir/test/config/suite.elixir - contains list of all available tests\r\n- test/elixir/test/config/skip.elixir - contains list of tests to skip\r\n\r\nIn order to update the `test/elixir/test/config/suite.elixir` when new tests\r\nare added. The one would need to run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMIX_ENV=integration mix suite > test/elixir/test/config/suite.elixir\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe number of enabled tests in this PR is 237, while `make check` has only 80.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1) Make sure that tests discovery works\r\n```\r\nMIX_ENV=integration mix suite\r\n```\r\n2) Make sure the tests run and pass by using `make elixir-suite`\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n- somewhat related to https://github.com/apache/couchdb/issues/1515 in a sense that it allows to have different skip files for builds with different extensions (geo+search) \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nIf an attachment was stored uncompressed but later is replicated\r\ninternally to a node that wants to compress it (based on\r\ncontent-type), couchdb compares the uncompressed md5 with the\r\ncompressed md5 and fails. This breaks eventual consistency between\r\nreplicas.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the unnecessary MD5 check that is, in these specific\r\ncircumstances, always called with mismatched arguments.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n1. Upload an attachment with a content-type not included in compressible_type config\r\n2. change compressible_type to include this content-type\r\n3. stop a node\r\n4. delete the hosting shard of the attachment\r\n5. start the node.\r\n6. observe md5_mismatch errors in the log.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

Overview\r\n\r\nDue to a retry loop in erlfb:transactional couchdb might try to send\r\nmultiple http responses for a single request which is clearly an\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures the second attempt is prevented, closing the TCP\r\nsocket instead.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nI induced this by making a large db (10,000 docs) and queried a view that emitted a row for each, but any long-running streamed response endpoint (except _changes) will suffice. If you use curl with `--raw` you will see a new `200 OK` starting after approximately 5 seconds. With this PR applied you will instead get a `curl: (18) transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining` error.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n-

If a section needs no action - remove it.\r\n\r\n     Also remember, that CouchDB uses the Review-Then-Commit (RTC) model\r\n     of code collaboration. Positive feedback is represented +1 from committers\r\n     and negative is a -1. The -1 also means veto, and needs to be addressed\r\n     to proceed.

However, this isn't\r\naccurate in the case where the compaction job has to re-spawn to catch up on\r\nintervening changes since the same logical compaction job continues with\r\nanother pid and smoosh is not aware. In such cases, a smoosh channel with\r\nconcurrency one can start arbitrarily many additional database compaction jobs.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, we added a check to see if a compaction PID exists for\r\na db in `start_compact`. But wee need to add another check because this check\r\nis only for shard that comes off the queue. So the following can still occur:\r\n\r\n1. Enqueue a bunch of stuff into channel with concurrency 1\r\n2. Begin highest priority job, Shard1, in channel\r\n3. Compaction finishes, discovers compaction file is behind main file\r\n4. Smoosh-monitored PID for Shard1 exits, a new one starts to finish the job\r\n5. Smoosh receives the 'DOWN' message, begins the next highest priority job,\r\nShard2\r\n6. Channel concurrency is now 2, not 1\r\n\r\nThis change adds another check into the 'DOWN' message so that it checks for\r\nthat specific shard. If the compaction PID exists then it means a new process\r\nwas spawned and we just monitor that one and add it back to the queue. The\r\nlength of the queue does not change and therefore we won’t spawn new\r\ncompaction jobs.\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n<!-- Describe how we can test your changes.\r\n     Does it provides any behaviour that the end users\r\n     could notice? -->\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\n<!-- If your changes affects multiple components in different\r\n     repositories

Overview\r\n\r\nA document with lots of conflicts can blow up couchjs if the user\r\ncalls _changes with a javascript filter and with `style=all_docs` as\r\nthis option causes up to fetch all the conflicts.\r\n\r\nAll leaf revisions of the document are then passed in a single call to\r\nddoc_prompt, which can fail if there's a lot of them.\r\n\r\nIn that event, we simply try them sequentially and assemble the\r\nresponse from each call.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nCovered by unit test, but manual test as follows;\r\n\r\nYou need to create a highly conflicted document and lower couchjs's memory allowance for a practical test. Here's how I did it;\r\n\r\n1) edit dev/run;\r\n\r\n```\r\n-    qs_javascript = toposixpath(\"%s %s\" % (couchjs, mainjs))\r\n+    qs_javascript = toposixpath(\"%s -S 1048576 %s\" % (couchjs, mainjs))\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) create a filter;\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl 'foo:bar@localhost:15984/db1/_design/foo' -XPUT -d '{\"filters\":{\"pass\":\"function(doc,req) { log(JSON.stringify(doc)); return true; }\"}}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) create a highly conflicted doc;\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor I in {1..2000}; do curl 'foo:bar@localhost:15984/db1/bigdoc?new_edits=false' -XPUT -d \"{\\\"_rev\\\":\\\"1-conflict$I\\\", \\\"foo\\\":\\\"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\\\"}\" ; done\r\n```\r\n\r\n4) then run it through filter_docs;\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl 'foo:bar@localhost:15984/db1/_changes?filter=foo/pass&style=all_docs'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the patch, this will fail with an {exit_status, 1} error from couchjs. With it, it succeeds.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3248\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes

Overview\r\n\r\nA document with lots of conflicts can blow up couchjs if the user\r\ncalls _changes with a javascript filter and with `style=all_docs` as\r\nthis option causes up to fetch all the conflicts.\r\n\r\nAll leaf revisions of the document are then passed in a single call to\r\nddoc_prompt, which can fail if there's a lot of them.\r\n\r\nIn that event, we simply try them sequentially and assemble the\r\nresponse from each call.\r\n\r\nShould be backported to 3.x\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\nCovered by unit test but a manual test would proceed as follows;\r\n\r\nYou need to create a highly conflicted document and lower couchjs's memory allowance for a practical test. Here's how I did it;\r\n\r\n1) edit dev/run;\r\n\r\n```\r\n-    qs_javascript = toposixpath(\"%s %s\" % (couchjs, mainjs))\r\n+    qs_javascript = toposixpath(\"%s -S 1048576 %s\" % (couchjs, mainjs))\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) create a filter;\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl 'foo:bar@localhost:15984/db1/_design/foo' -XPUT -d '{\"filters\":{\"pass\":\"function(doc,req) { log(JSON.stringify(doc)); return true; }\"}}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) create a highly conflicted doc;\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor I in {1..2000}; do curl 'foo:bar@localhost:15984/db1/bigdoc?new_edits=false' -XPUT -d \"{\\\"_rev\\\":\\\"1-conflict$I\\\", \\\"foo\\\":\\\"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\\\"}\" ; done\r\n```\r\n\r\n4) then run it through filter_docs;\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl 'foo:bar@localhost:15984/db1/_changes?filter=foo/pass&style=all_docs'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout the patch, this will fail with an {exit_status, 1} error from couchjs. With it, it succeeds.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb/pull/3249\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes

Overview\r\n\r\nCurrently `npm install --production` is used when creating the Fauxton release. Due to changes in https://github.com/apache/couchdb-fauxton/pull/1299, build time tools (like `grunt`) will no longer be available when installing dependencies with the `--production` flag.\r\n\r\nTo account for this new behavior, this PR removes the `--production` flag on both Makefiles. \r\n\r\nNote this change only impacts what is installed inside the `node_modules` folder, but it has no impact on the Fauxton assets generated and copied to the `share/www` folder.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/apache/couchdb-fauxton src/fauxton\r\nmake fauxton with_fauxton=1\r\n```\r\nThen `ls share/www` to verify the assets were created.\r\n\r\n## Related Issues or Pull Requests\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/couchdb-fauxton/pull/1299\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [ ] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in

https://www.haproxy.com/blog/haproxy-1-9-has-arrived/ , multithreading is higher perf than multiprocessing. So, let's do that by default, and assume 4 cores (seems safe).\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`dev/run --with-haproxy`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] Code is written and works

many parallel attempts to insert the same keys can result in\r\n`{erlfdb_error, 1020}`, which translates to:\r\n\"Transaction not committed due to conflict with another transaction\"\r\n\r\nThis

Overview\r\n\r\nBefore this change a reduce call that contained no rows would end up\r\nreturning the \"default\" value of the given reduce function which is\r\nwhatever it would return when given an empty array as input.

is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [ ] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes

Overview\r\n\r\nDisable custom reduce functions by default.\r\n\r\nCustom reduce functions are notoriously difficult to implement correctly and often lead to fairly bad user experience when they're inevitably misunderstood or used incorrectly. The feature will remain available via config toggle for at least 4.0.\r\n\r\n## Testing recommendations\r\n\r\n`make check`\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] Code is written and works correctly\r\n- [x] Changes are covered by tests\r\n- [x] Any new configurable parameters are documented in `rel/overlay/etc/default.ini`\r\n- [ ] A PR for documentation changes has been made in
