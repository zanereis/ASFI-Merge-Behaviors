is currently sharing the same `ConfigDef` object for all its connectors and tasks, which would be fine _if_ that object were used as-is. However, the `MirrorTaskConfig` class mutates the `ConfigDef` by defining additional properties, which leads to a potential `ConcurrentModificationException` during worker configuration validation and unintended inclusion of those new properties in the `ConfigDef` for the connectors which in turn is then visible via the REST API's `/connectors/{name}/config/validate` endpoint.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is a one-liner that just creates a copy of the `ConfigDef` before defining new properties.\r\n\r\nA unit test is added that fails without this fix and passes with it.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist

the case described in the JIRA, there was a 50%+ increase in the total fetch request rate in\r\n2.4.0 due to this change.\r\n\r\nI included a few additional clean-ups:\r\n* Simplify `findPreferredReadReplica` and avoid unnecessary collection copies.\r\n* Use `LongSupplier` instead of `Supplier<Long>` in `SubscriptionState` to avoid unnecessary boxing.\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test to ReplicaManagerTest and cleaned up the test class a bit including\r\nconsistent usage of Time in MockTimer and other components.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ]

patch fixes KAFKA-9821 for Streams by persisting the required rebalance in the assignment. If a member fails and restarts it will receive its last assignment and notify the thread to trigger a new rebalance, even with static membership.\r\n\r\nNote: in the consumer client, the member who has to _revoke_ some partitions is responsible for triggering the followup rebalance. Here we are actually encoding the required rebalance for the member who was supposed to _receive_ these partitions. Since this only signals to the client to request a rebalance upon the next poll in both cases, and the rebalance schedule is reset in `onAssignment`, this should not result in extra (unnecessary) rebalances even if one member lags the other in requesting this.\r\n\r\nThis patch also consolidates the two rebalancing triggering mechanisms currently used by the Streams partition assignor: the `AssignorError` and the newly introduced `nextScheduleRebalanceMs`. Since the latter encompasses the former, we can remove the `REBALANCE_NEEDED` assignor error and just schedule the next rebalance for `0L` ms to trigger it immediately. This has the nice side effect of removing the only recoverable AssignorError, so we no longer have to worry about handling this error and can just assume it to be fatal and shut

does UnknownTopicOrPartitionException typically occur?\r\n * Upon a topic creation, a follower broker of a new partition starts replica fetcher before the prospective leader broker of the new partition receives the leadership information from the controller (see [KAFKA-6221](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-6221)).\r\n * Upon a topic deletion, a follower broker of a to-be-deleted partition starts replica fetcher after the leader broker of the to-be-deleted partition processes the deletion information from the controller.\r\n * As expected, clusters with frequent topic creation and deletion report UnknownTopicOrPartitionException with relatively higher frequency.\r\n\r\nWhat is the impact?\r\n * Exception tracking systems identify the error logs with UnknownTopicOrPartitionException as an exception. This results in a lot of noise for a transient issue that is expected to recover by itself and a natural process in Kafka due to its asynchronous state propagation.\r\n\r\nWhy not move it to a lower than warn-level log?\r\n * Despite typically being a transient issue, UnknownTopicOrPartitionException may also indicate real issues if it doesn't fix itself after a short period of time. To ensure detection of such scenarios, we set the log level to warn.\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.

PR fixes and improves two major issues:\r\n\r\n1. When calling `KafkaStreams#store` we can always get an InvalidStateStoreException, and even waiting for Streams state to become RUNNING is not sufficient (this is also how OptimizedKTableIntegrationTest failed). So I wrapped all the function with a Util wrapper that captures and retries on that exception.\r\n\r\n2. While trouble-shooting this issue, I also realized a potential bug in test-util's `produceKeyValuesSynchronously`, which creates a new producer for each of the record to send in that batch --- i.e. if you are sending N records with a single call, within that call it will create N producers used to send one record each, which is very slow and costly.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2020-04-28T04:58:55Z","updated_at":"2020-04-28T22:04:39Z","closed_at":"2020-04-28T22:04:20Z","merged_at":"2020-04-28T22:04:20Z","merge_commit_sha":"11fc953c05eb2c8db61c61bc765aa8be0598d638","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8568/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8568/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8568/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/57a2c39bcded8ecbdf0f443520ed7385f4ce0dbf","head":{"label":"guozhangwang:K9176-get-store-with-exception","ref":"K9176-get-store-with-exception","sha":"57a2c39bcded8ecbdf0f443520ed7385f4ce0dbf","user":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":39164613,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzOTE2NDYxMw==","name":"kafka","full_name":"guozhangwang/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"guozhangwang","id":10729597,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwNzI5NTk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10729597?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang","html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/guozhangwang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/guozhangwang/kafka","description":"Mirror

KIP-219, responses are sent immediately and we rely on a combination\r\nof clients and muting of the channel to throttle. The result of this is that\r\nwe need to track `apiThrottleTimeMs` as an explicit value instead of\r\ninferring it. On the other hand,  we no longer need\r\n`apiRemoteCompleteTimeNanos`.\r\n\r\nExtend `BaseQuotaTest` to verify that throttle time in the request channel\r\nmetrics are being set. Given the nature of the throttling numbers, the test\r\nis not particularly precise.\r\n\r\nI included a few clean-ups:\r\n* Pass KafkaMetric to QuotaViolationException so that the caller doesn't\r\nhave to retrieve it from the metrics registry.\r\n* Inline Supplier in SocketServer (use SAM).\r\n* Reduce redundant `time.milliseconds` and `time.nanoseconds`calls.\r\n* Use monotonic clock in ThrottledChannel and simplify `compareTo` method.\r\n* Simplify `TimerTaskList.compareTo`.\r\n* Consolidate the number of places where we update `apiLocalCompleteTimeNanos`\r\nand `responseCompleteTimeNanos`.\r\n* Added `toString` to ByteBufferSend` and `MultiRecordsSend`.\r\n* Restrict access to methods in `QuotaTestClients` to expose only what we need\r\nto.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

all other test cases, the `shouldAllowConcurrentAccesses` starts an async producer sending records throughout the test other than just synchronously sent and acked a few records before we start the

Right after the streams app is started, we check that at least one record is sent to the output topic (i.e. completed processing). However since only this test starts the producer async and did not wait for it to complete, it is possible that the async producer gets too longer to produce some records and causing it to

two options are essentially incompatible, as caching will do nothing to reduce downstream traffic and writes when it has to allow non-unique keys (skipping records where the value is also the same is a separate issue, see [KIP-557](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-557%3A+Add+emit+on+change+support+for+Kafka+Streams)). But enabling caching on a store that's configured to retain duplicates is actually more than just ineffective, and currently causes incorrect results.\r\n\r\nWe should just log a warning and disable caching whenever a store is retaining duplicates to avoid introducing a regression. Maybe when 3.0 comes around we should consider throwing an exception instead to alert the user more aggressively.","created_at":"2020-04-27T20:52:33Z","updated_at":"2020-05-01T00:27:56Z","closed_at":"2020-04-28T18:33:42Z","merged_at":"2020-04-28T18:33:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"6a5946282cbc6b24b185a1a1297110198fd9e97c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":820747028,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4MjA3NDcwMjg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/streams","name":"streams","color":"63edea","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8564/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/8564/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/8564/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/f354f53dbcc18669cca85f65eafc7ffd41b7b33a","head":{"label":"ableegoldman:9921-dont-allow-caching-and-duplictaes","ref":"9921-dont-allow-caching-and-duplictaes","sha":"f354f53dbcc18669cca85f65eafc7ffd41b7b33a","user":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":166325386,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjYzMjUzODY=","name":"kafka","full_name":"ableegoldman/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ableegoldman","id":4843099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4NDMwOTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4843099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman","html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ableegoldman/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ableegoldman/kafka","description":"Mirror

detailed description of your change,\r\n\r\n**Selector**\r\nThe Selector class will now take the new config CONNECTIONS_TIMEOUT_MS_CONFIG in its constructions. \r\n\r\n\r\n**idleExpiryManager**\r\nCurrently, we have an idleExpiryManager that uses the LRU algorithm evicting the oldest idle connected socket channels. Similarly, we can instantiate a new LinkedHashMap to keep those socket channels initiating the connection and evict the timeout channels.\r\n\r\nCurrently, all the channels will be kept on the same LRU map. We will split the connected socket channels and connecting socket channels into different LRU map (we will call them \"lruConnectingConnections\" and \"lruConnectedConnections\" later).\r\n\r\nHere's the state transition:\r\n\r\nWhen the socket channel is initiating the connection, we will put the socket channel to the lruConnectingConnections.\r\n\r\nWhen the connection is successfully built, we will move the channel from lruConnectingConnections into lruConnectedConnections.\r\n\r\nIn each selector poll, we will remove the oldest timeout socket channel in both lruConnectingConnections and lruConnectedConnections, if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n**LeastLoadedNodeProvider**\r\nCurrently, when no nodes provided in --boostrap-server option is connected, the LeastLoadedNodeProvider will provide an unconnected node for the client. The Cluster class shuffled the nodes to balance the initial pressure and the LeastLoadedNodeProvider will always provide the same node, which is the last node after shuffling. Consequently, though we may provide several bootstrap servers, the client not be able to connect to the cluster if any of the servers in the --bootstrap-server list is offline.\r\n\r\nI'm changing the provider to interact with the ClusterConnectionStates to determine which node to provide when no connection exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n**ClusterConnectionStates**\r\nClusterConnectionStates will keep the index of the most recently provided node. Meanwhile, a public API looks like below will be added to simulate the round-robin node picking.\r\n\r\npublic synchronized int nextNodeIdx(int nodeSize) {\r\n          return (this.nextNodeIdx++) % nodeSize;\r\n}\r\n\r\nThe LeastLoadedNodeProvider will provide the nodeSize to prevent the out of bound excpetion. \r\n\r\nWhen the LeastLoadedNodeProvider iterates the node list, it can consult the ClusterConnectionStates for the index of the node it should provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Summary of testing strategy (including rationale)\r\nfor the feature or bug fix. Unit and/or integration\r\ntests are expected for any behaviour change and\r\nsystem tests should be considered for larger changes.*\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade

(#8469)\r\n\r\nIn KAFKA-9826, a log whose first dirty offset was past the start of the active segment and past the last cleaned point resulted in an endless cycle of picking the segment to clean and discarding it. Though this didn't interfere with cleaning other log segments, it kept the log cleaner thread continuously busy (potentially wasting CPU and impacting other running threads) and filled the logs with lots of extraneous messages.\r\n\r\nThis was determined to be because the active segment was getting mistakenly picked for cleaning, and because the logSegments code handles (start == end) cases only for (start, end) on a segment boundary: the intent is to return a null list, but if they're not on a segment boundary, the routine returns that segment.\r\n\r\nThis fix has two parts:\r\n\r\nIt changes logSegments to handle start==end by returning an empty List always.\r\n\r\nIt changes the definition of calculateCleanableBytes to not consider anything past the UncleanableOffset; previously, it would potentially shift the UncleanableOffset to match the firstDirtyOffset even if the firstDirtyOffset was past the firstUncleanableOffset. This has no real effect now in the context of the fix for (1) but it makes the code read more like the model that the code is attempting to follow.\r\n\r\nThese changes require modifications to a few test cases that handled this particular test case; they were introduced in the context of KAFKA-8764. Those situations are now handled elsewhere in code, but the tests themselves allowed a DirtyOffset in the active segment, and expected an active segment to be selected for cleaning.\r\n\r\nReviewer: Jun Rao <junrao@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n*More detailed description of your change,\r\nif necessary.
