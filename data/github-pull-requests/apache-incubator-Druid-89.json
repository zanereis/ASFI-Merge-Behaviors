Because the drop here was never previously working, this may be worth discussion of any implications.","created_at":"2018-03-23T23:17:27Z","updated_at":"2018-07-06T15:38:41Z","closed_at":"2018-03-29T17:30:13Z","merged_at":"2018-03-29T17:30:13Z","merge_commit_sha":"30fc4d3ba0c43409ea9b0ef228c017345c02ef0b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4NQ==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Bug","name":"Bug","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":632425053,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw2MzI0MjUwNTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Segment%20Balancing/Coordination","name":"Area

PR allows indexing tasks to return a map of TaskReport objects along with the TaskStatus. A TaskReport will contain structured information about a task, such as row stats, parsing errors, or a list of published segments.\r\n\r\nThe TaskReports will be uploaded to deep storage along with the Task's stdout log, accessible via an overlord endpoint keyed by task ID.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to support PR #5418 and #5492 which will generate large blocks of structured information upon task completion. \r\n\r\nThis large TaskReport information is kept in deep storage only, to avoid storing large objects in the metadata storage or in zookeeper nodes (via RemoteTaskRunner).\r\n\r\nExecutorLifecycle will write the TaskReports to disk and strip out the TaskReport objects before returning a TaskStatus, and the deep storage upload is handled in ForkingTaskRunner like the log upload.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-03-23T01:14:41Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T23:31:08Z","closed_at":"2018-04-02T19:10:57Z","merged_at":"2018-04-02T19:10:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"723f7ac55095829c57f8d8a8a03aaca97adc2a49","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":17287687,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzI4NzY4Nw==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Feature","name":"Feature","color":"2ceefb","default":false,"description":null},{"id":219582906,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTk1ODI5MDY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/Area%20-%20Batch%20Ingestion","name":"Area

is for proposal #5503.\r\n\r\nWith this feature:\r\n\r\nUsers could be able to check the executed query ids via interface:\r\n```\r\nhttp://{broker-location}/druid/v2/history\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a specific case, users use this interface to check executed SQL queries:\r\n```\r\nhttp://{broker-location}/druid/v2/history?sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, a detailed interface is provided:\r\n```\r\nhttp://{broker-location}/druid/v2/history/{queryId}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated data is stored in a new table from metadata storage:\r\n```\r\n+--------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\r\n| Field        | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |\r\n+--------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+\r\n| id           | bigint(20)   | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |\r\n| query_id     | varchar(255) | NO   |     |

different values of `type` field. Below is showing the different `type`s:\r\n- broker_time  \r\nthe metric `query time` of a query\r\n- node_time\r\nthe metric `ttfb` of subqueries run on different nodes\r\n- sql_query_text  \r\nthe sql query text if query is a sql query\r\n- datasources  \r\ndatasources used by the query\r\n\r\n`QueryHistoryResource.createDetail(List<QueryHistoryEntry> entries)` is responsible for merging all aspects of a queryId to a DetailedEntry object, which is going to be jsonized and returned as HTTP response.\r\n\r\nThe jsonized detail data is like below:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"queryID\": \"44349763-b3c1-4a8d-a9f1-5013420b46d0\",\r\n  \"profile\": {\r\n    \"broker\": 45,\r\n    \"druid-middlemanager-1:8102\": 3,\r\n    \"druid-historical-1:8102\": 40\r\n  },\r\n  \"createDate\": \"2018-03-19T03:11:08.795Z\",\r\n  \"status\": \"FINISHED\",\r\n  \"datasources\": [\"table-1\"],\r\n  \"sql\": \"SELECT * FROM table-1 LIMIT 10\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this feature is disabled by default. To enable, edit broker runtime config and set `druid.broker.history.enable=true`.","created_at":"2018-03-22T02:55:57Z","updated_at":"2021-03-19T02:29:27Z","closed_at":"2019-03-07T06:10:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ebacfe4a06481cb0f51757140f858920b27d3dc3","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1252153393,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjUyMTUzMzkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5514/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5514/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5514/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/64d29ab9b4cba5a7caba08124b36d42eae306bd4","head":{"label":"zhztheplayer:query-history","ref":"query-history","sha":"64d29ab9b4cba5a7caba08124b36d42eae306bd4","user":{"login":"zhztheplayer","id":11284395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjg0Mzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11284395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer","html_url":"https://github.com/zhztheplayer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123392705,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMzOTI3MDU=","name":"druid","full_name":"zhztheplayer/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhztheplayer","id":11284395,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMjg0Mzk1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11284395?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer","html_url":"https://github.com/zhztheplayer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhztheplayer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhztheplayer/druid","description":"Column

PR introduces a new task type, `index_parallel`, for parallel batch indexing without other systems like hadoop or spark. Here is a brief design overview.\r\n\r\n- `index_parallel` task is a _supervisor task_. It basically creates multiple worker tasks and submits them to overlords. \r\n   - There are two reasons for adding a new supervisor task instead of a new supervisor. First, the supervisor is responsible for acquiring and releasing task locks, but our current locking system is tightly coupled with task system - a task should be submitted to acquire a lock. So, it is much easier to add a supervisor task rather than a supervisor. Second, our supervisor works greatly well, but it has the problem of single point of failure. Running a supervisor task on one of peons makes easier to avoid this problem by supporting retying failed supervisor tasks in the future.\r\n- When a supervisor task is submitted, it first checks the given firehoseFactory is `splittable`. The splittable firehoseFactories are responsible for generating `inputSplit`s. The supervisor task will submit the same number of tasks with the number of inputSplits.\r\n- Each worker task reads input data and makes segments. If everything goes well, they report a list of pushed segments via HTTP to the supervisor task.\r\n- The supervisor task periodically checks the worker task statuses. If one of them fails, it resubmits the failed task until the retrying number reaches the configured limit. If all worker tasks succeed, then it collects the reported list of generated segments and publishes those segments.\r\n\r\nHere is an example ingestion spec.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"type\" :

#4131 introduced a new copy builder for segmentMetadata that did\r\nnot retain the value of usingDefaultInterval.

2 of changes for SQL Compatible Null Handling - \r\nThis PR contains changes to improve handling of null values in druid by treating nulls as missing values which don’t actually exist. This will make it more compatible to SQL standard and help with integration with other existing BI systems which support ODBC/JDBC. (Detailed description in proposal - https://github.com/druid-io/druid/issues/4349)\r\n\r\n## Nullability for Aggregators/Metrics\r\n\r\nAs per the current implementation, most aggregators are coded to replace null values with default e.g. sum treats them as zeroes, min treats them as positive infinity, etc.\r\nTo match the new semantics and make aggregators nullable, where if an aggregator encounters only the null values the result will be null value following changes are made -\r\n\r\n* Aggrgator/BufferAggregator - Added a new method boolean isNull() which returns false by default. aggregators that support nullability can choose to override this and return true if the aggregated result is null. \r\n* Added a NullableAggregator/NullableBufferAggregator which is be used as a decorator for existing aggregator implementations to make them nullable. This will return null values if all the values aggregated are null, If any of the aggregated value is non-null, it will have same behavior as the delegate aggregator. \r\n* If new null behavior is enabled, aggregator factories will decorate the aggregators with NullableAggregator/NullableBufferAggregator. \r\n* Added a new abstract class NullableAggregatorFactory which helps in reducing duplicate code and decide to switch between nullable and non-nullable aggregators. \r\n* Cardinality and HyperUnique  aggregators ignore null values and only count non-null values, If all the encountered values are null, the result will be 0. This is different from current behavior where null values are also counted.\r\n* Count aggregator - since count aggregator is not associated with any column and just a count of the number of rows, it has the same behavior as before. \r\n\r\n## Math Expressions Null Handling\r\n* For general calculations like sum, full expression is be considered as null if any of the components is null. \r\n* StringLiteral now supports null and and expressions containing non-quoted null is parsed as StringLiteral with null \r\n* Specifying a default value for null is supported by the use of NVL or IF clause to assign default values at query time.\r\n\r\n## Filtering on Null values\r\n* SelectorDimFilter currently specifies filtering on null values but the implementation assumes null and empty strings as equivalent. The implementation is changed to consider null and empty string differently. Generation of cache key for selectorDimFilter is also modified to support null.\r\n* InFilter/ExpressionFilter/LikeFilter are also modified to not treat nulls as empty strings. \r\n\r\n## Changes to Druid build-in SQL layer\r\n* NULL and empty strings are treated differently. \r\n* IS NULL and IS NOT NULL filters against null values instead of empty strings. \r\n* NVL, IFNULL and COALESCE work as per SQL standard. \r\n* count now skips null values and works as per SQL standard. \r\n\r\n## Backwards Compatibility \r\n* **_\"druid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull\"_** is added as a new config. The default value is set to true for backwards compatibility. \r\n*  code places in query/ingestion where we converted emptyToNull or nullToEmpty now use NullHandlingHelper which only does the conversion if backwards compatibility is enabled. \r\n* Storage layer changes are backwards compatible for GenericIndexed/String columns. \r\n* For Numeric columns new V2 serde implementations are introduced which also supports serde of nullRowsBitmaps. Previous implementations are kept unchanged to read any existing segments. \r\n\r\n## Testing \r\n* Most of the unit tests that tested nulls are modified to have two branches of expected results to test new/old behavior both. \r\n* For CI have added new runs to test matrix to test new behavior for nulls. \r\n* To run the tests with new behavior run **_\"-Ddruid.generic.useDefaultValueForNull=false\"_**\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n---\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"34\" align=\"absmiddle\"

is based of proposal #5238. \r\nIntroduces changes that support local batch indexing of data residing in RDBMS. A sample ingestion spec snippet would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n      \"type\" : \"index\",\r\n        \"firehose\" : {\r\n        \"type\" : \"sql\",\r\n        \"database\": {\r\n        \"type\": \"mysql\",\r\n        \"connectorConfig\" : {\r\n        \"connectURI\" : \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sqltest\",\r\n        \"user\" : \"druid\",\r\n        \"password\" : \"diurd\"\r\n        }\r\n        },\r\n        \"sqls\" : [\"SELECT * FROM index_data_a\", \"SELECT * FROM index_data_b\"],\r\n        }\r\n     },\r\n     :\r\n     :\r\n     \"parser\" : {\r\n        \"type\" : \"map\",\r\n        \"parseSpec\" :\r\n        \t:\r\n        \t:\r\n\r\n```\r\n`SqlFirehoseFactory` is introduced which would execute the SQL query, read all the results to a file locally and index from the file. This avoids having to keep a persistent connection to the database until all the inputrows are read.\r\nWhen prefetching is enabled and there are multiple sql queries to index from, the sql results are prefetched in the background similiar to PrefetchableTextFileFirehoseFactory.\r\nUpdated docs and added tests.","created_at":"2018-02-28T20:04:38Z","updated_at":"2018-10-08T23:37:53Z","closed_at":"2018-05-22T03:33:02Z","merged_at":"2018-05-22T03:33:02Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b9611a60ea80527d51e34c83b333d8457def52d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/25","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/druid/milestone/25","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/milestones/25/labels","id":3023864,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lMzAyMzg2NA==","number":25,"title":"0.13.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"leventov","id":609240,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYwOTI0MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/609240?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov","html_url":"https://github.com/leventov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/leventov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":492,"state":"closed","created_at":"2018-01-09T18:30:01Z","updated_at":"2019-01-10T17:19:08Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":"2019-01-10T17:19:08Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5441/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/5441/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/issues/5441/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/druid/statuses/62238a1c33aa26bfebfce670dc9dca87f888d5f3","head":{"label":"a2l007:rdbmsindex","ref":"rdbmsindex","sha":"62238a1c33aa26bfebfce670dc9dca87f888d5f3","user":{"login":"a2l007","id":4603202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDMyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4603202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007","html_url":"https://github.com/a2l007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":97611468,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk5NzYxMTQ2OA==","name":"druid","full_name":"a2l007/druid","private":false,"owner":{"login":"a2l007","id":4603202,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ2MDMyMDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4603202?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007","html_url":"https://github.com/a2l007","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/a2l007/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/a2l007/druid","description":"Column

relies on the page cache of Linux in order to have memory segments.\r\nHowever when loading segments from deep storage or rebalancing the page\r\ncache can get poisoned by segments that should not be in memory yet.\r\nThis can significantly slow down Druid in case rebalancing happens\r\nas data that might not be queried often is suddenly in the page cache.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements the same logic as is in Apache Cassandra and Apache\r\nBookkeeper, but extends it slightly by copying in chunks so the cache will \r\nonly hit by max 8mb instead of the whole file.\r\n\r\nCloses #4746 \r\n\r\nFurther optimizations can happen when copying from the local filesystem. I would like to agree on the approach first and get this merged first before tackling the other issue.\r\n\r\nAs this is automatically enabled on Linux it should be covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n@drcrallen @Fokko

PR adds more ingestion status and error reporting for IndexTask, KafkaIndexTask, and HadoopIndexTask.\r\n\r\nThings changed:\r\n- ParseException handling:\r\n   - `reportParseExceptions` and `ignoreInvalidRows` are now deprecated\r\n   - Three new configurations have been added to the various tuningConfig classes:\r\n      - `logParseExceptions` - log.error() when a parse exception occurs\r\n      - `maxParseExceptions` - The maximum number of parse exceptions allowed before a task fails\r\n      - `maxSavedParseExceptions` - Save the last N parse exceptions to a circular buffer, retrievable via a new `unparseableEvents` endpoint on the tasks, and also exposed in the completed task status\r\n      -  When `reportParseExceptions` is true, this is treated as `maxParseExceptions`set to 0.\r\n- New row counter type: `processedWithErrors` -> This refers to rows where the row was parseable but a column value could not be parsed into the correct type (e.g., a row that has \"helloworld\" for a long column). These rows are counted against the `maxParseExceptions` limit.\r\n- TaskStatus changes\r\n   - The task status now has an additional error message:\r\n      - `errorMsg` -> Message showing cause for task failure, truncated to 100 characters. The full message is available in the TaskReport described below.\r\n- `rowStats` peon endpoint (`http://localhost:<task port>/druid/worker/v1/chat/<task id>/rowStats`)\r\n   - Shows the current total row stats for an ingestion task. By default this shows stats only for the current ingestion phase. Adding `?full` will return stats for all phases.\r\n- `unparseableEvents` peon endpoint (`http://localhost:<task port>/druid/worker/v1/chat/<task id>/unparseableEvents`)\r\n  - Returns a list of the last N parse exceptions encountered by a task\r\n- Ingestion stats and errors TaskReport:\r\n  - Available at (`http://<overlord>/druid/indexer/v1/task/<task_id>/reports`) after a task completes. Contains the following:\r\n  - `ingestionState` -> shows what ingestion phase the ingestion task is currently in, possible values are NOT_STARTED, DETERMINE_PARTITIONS, BUILD_SEGMENTS, and COMPLETED\r\n  - `rowStats`\r\n  - `unparseableEvents`\r\n  -  `errorMsg` -> shows the failure cause of a task\r\n\r\n\r\nExample task report:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"ingestionStatsAndErrors\": {\r\n
