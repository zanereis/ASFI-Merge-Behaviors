What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn `ProtobufFunctionsSuite`, there are some cases where `df.take(1).toSeq(0)` is used to get the first data in the DataFrame. This pr changes them to use the `.first()` API to achieve the same purpose, which looks relatively clearer and more concise.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n`.first()` API appears to have clearer semantics.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR disables `pyspark.tests.test_worker.WorkerSegfaultNonDaemonTest.test_python_segfault` with Python 3.12 for now.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis test is flaky, and stops the tests run till the end, e.g., see https://github.com/apache/spark/actions/runs/7006848931/job/19059701743\r\n\r\nHow `faulthandler` is used is correct, as documented in the standard Python documentation. So I do believe this is a bug from Python 3.12. I will track separately in Python side.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, test-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython/run-tests --python-executable=python3  --testnames 'pyspark.tests.test_worker WorkerSegfaultNonDaemonTest.test_python_segfault'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere is a behavioral difference between Scala 2.13 and 2.12 for explicit `ArrayOps.toSeq` calls, similar to the implicit conversion from `Array` to `Seq`.\r\n\r\nIn Scala 2.12, `ArrayOps.toSeq` will return `thisCollection` ,  and use implicit conversion rules to wrap the `Array` as `mutable.WrappedArray`, this process does not involve any collection copy:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nWelcome to Scala 2.12.18 (OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, Java 17.0.9).\r\nType in expressions for evaluation. Or try :help.\r\n\r\nscala> Array(1,2,3).toSeq\r\nres0: Seq[Int] = WrappedArray(1, 2, 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in Scala 2.13, it returns an `immutable.ArraySeq` that with collection copy.\r\n\r\nSince we have always used the non-collection copy behavior for this explicit conversion in the era of Scala 2.12, it is safe to assume that no collection copy is needed for Scala 2.13.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this pr replaces explicit `ArrayOps.toSeq` in the Spark code with `s.c.immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` to avoid a collection copy, and this pr only involves changes to the production code, and does not involve changes to the test code. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReplace `ArrayOps#toSeq` with `s.c.immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` to save a collection copy, which has potential benefits for performance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Action\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-11-27T13:46:20Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T19:11:23Z","closed_at":"2023-11-29T19:09:59Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c54ddce062b9a0bf5575119cb55d328bc4641f61","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to adjust the font color of the titles in the PySpark documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor better visibility. The current title font color is not optimal for readability especially in dark mode, which can hinder user experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the font color for titles has been updated to a lighter shade, improving contrast and readability as below:\r\n\r\n## Before\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1025\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 5 57 42 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/19ee6e80-24ac-475f-94d1-1b5e95ef381a\">\r\n\r\n## After\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1023\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-27 at 5 56 49 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/6a0d44e3-d28e-44ff-9ee2-1f5d69ef8aa1\">\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nBy manually building docs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes an enhancement of readability of the PySpark API reference by hiding verbose typehints. This change aims to improve the readability of the documentation by reducing verbosity in the function/method signatures.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the PySpark API documentation displays all type hints in the signatures, which can make the documentation appear cluttered and less readable.\r\n\r\nBy setting `autodoc_typehints` to 'none', we can achieve a cleaner and more concise presentation of our API, similar to how the Pandas documentation handles type hints. \r\n\r\nThis approach has been effective in Pandas, making the documentation more approachable and easier to understand. We should follow the good example and apply the same behavior to the PySpark API reference.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but the API reference

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are some calls to `SparkSession.sqlContext.conf` in the Spark code, which is equivalent to `SparkSession.sqlContext.sparkSession.sessionState.conf`. This PR changes them to directly call `SparkSession.sessionState.conf` or expand to `SQLContext.SparkSession.sessionState.conf`\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this PR marks the internal API `SQLContext.conf` as deprecated, and `SparkSession.sessionState.conf` should be used directly.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n1. `SparkSession.sessionState.conf` has a shallower call stack compared to `SparkSession.sqlContext.conf`\r\n2. `SQLContext` has been marked as deprecated since Apache Spark 1.6, and its APIs should be avoided as much as possible in Spark's internal code.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-27T06:36:35Z","updated_at":"2023-11-27T16:43:55Z","closed_at":"2023-11-27T16:43:33Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ae5e152edcdf05fa669c3db1ff51cb26c9e2148","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR deprecates `pyspark.keyword_only` API, remove the usage in our codebase.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR also removes the docstring that is used for substituting the signature (`autodoc_docstring_signature` feature) in user-facing API documentation. We use keyword-only arguments after SPARK-32933 so we do not need to substitute them anymore, see also https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/5142.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nInitially `pyspark.keyword_only` was added to maintain the Python compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 (see [PEP-3102](https://peps.python.org/pep-3102/)). Those Python 2-style arguments were removed in SPARK-32933 so we do not need this decorator anymore.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, it deprecates `pyspark.keyword_only`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually checked the documentation build, and linter. Existing test cases should validate them.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-27T01:04:51Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:47:35Z","closed_at":"2023-11-27T10:23:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"eee7e861ed8e5b38b80c075f2351f8305635f5e2","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801475,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/ML","name":"ML","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44023/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44023/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44023/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/842c104b08ec3bfd3dd103ca1660a309e0aa6518","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-46107","ref":"SPARK-46107","sha":"842c104b08ec3bfd3dd103ca1660a309e0aa6518","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBuilt-in XML data source gives related value and schema of the inner or nested elements. However, additional operations should be made by developers manually to convert unstructured data to structured, tabular format. If nested elements are kept in a format that is suitable with XML (for each level), we can convert them easily to a structured, tabular format with the existing methods that have already been developed (infer method of XmlInferSchema and parseColumn method of StaxXmlParser). Therefore there should be an option that affects StaxXmlParser and InferSchema classes to keep inner XML elements in their original or raw format. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n  1. We can easily convert internal or nested XML elements into structured or tabular format by using existing methods with this  option.\r\n  2. For complex XML files, we can apply step-by-step conversion to XML elements at each level. In each step, only the element at the next level is considered.\r\n  3. With step by step conversion, we can remove or skip unwanted inner XML elements.\r\n  4. Element-specific operations can be applied to elements at each level.\r\n  5. Parent-child relationships between elements can be preserved.\r\n  6. No additional operations are required to convert the unstructured format to the structured format.\r\n\r\n\"keepInnerXmlAsRaw\" option is **true**:\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-11-27

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis adds support for the async profiler to Spark\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nProfiling of JVM applications on a cluster is cumbersome and it can be complicated to save the output of the profiler especially if the cluster is on K8s where the executor pods are removed and any files saved to the local file system become inaccessible.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR, I propose to restrict the supported charsets in the `encode()` functions by the list from [the doc](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/sql/#encode):\r\n```\r\n'US-ASCII', 'ISO-8859-1', 'UTF-8', 'UTF-16BE', 'UTF-16LE', 'UTF-16'\r\n```\r\nand introduce the SQL config `spark.sql.legacy.javaCharsets` for restoring the previous behaviour.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCurrently the list of supported charsets in `encode()` is not stable and fully depends on the used JDK version. So, sometimes user code might not work because a devop changed Java version in Spark cluster.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy running new checks:\r\n```\r\n$ PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3 build/sbt \"sql/testOnly org.apache.spark.sql.SQLQueryTestSuite -- -z string-functions.sql\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Was this patch

request?\r\nIf the hive table is a table, the outsourcing information will be displayed during ShowCreateTableCommand.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE test_extaral_1 (a String);\r\n\r\nWhen using SHOW CREATE TABLE test, if it is an external table, it is not displayed whether it is an external table.\r\n\r\nspark-sql> show create table test_extaral_1;\r\ncreatetab_stmt\r\nCREATE TABLE `test`.`test_extaral_1` (\r\n  `a` STRING)\r\nUSING orc\r\nLOCATION '/test/test_extaral_1'\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYou can modify the display and see whether it is the appearance。\r\n\r\nspark-sql> show create table test_extaral_1;\r\ncreatetab_stmt\r\n\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `test`.`test_extaral_1` (\r\n  `a` STRING)\r\nUSING orc\r\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `test`.`test_extaral_1` (\r\nLOCATION '/test/test_extaral_1'\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis can help users quickly distinguish between internal and external surfaces。\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNO\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are a lot of `[string|array].size` called.\r\nIn fact, the size calls the underlying length, this behavior increase the stack length.\r\nWe should call `[string|array].length` directly.\r\nWe also get the compile waring `Replace .size with .length on arrays and strings`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReduce stack depth by

If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThis pr introduces `case class AdaptiveRuleContext(isSubquery: Boolean, isFinalStage: Boolean)` which can be used inside adaptive sql extension rules through thread local, so that developers can modify the next plan fragment configs using `AdaptiveRuleContext.get()`.\r\n\r\nThe plan fragment configs can be propagated through multi-phases, e.g., if set a config in `queryPostPlannerStrategyRules` then the config can be gotten in `queryStagePrepRules`, `queryStageOptimizerRules` and `columnarRules`. The configs will be cleanup before going to execute, so in next round the configs will be empty.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to enhance the PySpark documentation by leveraging modern Sphinx features and functionalities. The primary objective is to improve the overall user experience and readability of the documentation. To achieve this, the PR includes an upgrade of `Sphinx` and `Jinja2` to their newer/latest versions, enabling us to use the latest `pydata_sphinx_theme` features such as light/dark mode toggling.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the PySpark documentation is unable to utilize many of the advanced features available in recent `Sphinx` versions due to older package versions. This limitation hinders the documentation's visual appeal and usability, particularly when compared to other projects like Pandas which have already adopted these enhancements. For example:\r\n\r\n## Pandas API reference (better layout / switching light & dark mode available)\r\n\r\n### Dark mode\r\n<img width=\"1409\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-26 at 5 43 29 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/0f97ce4a-c1ec-47fb-9295-445c2d557393\">\r\n\r\n### Light mode\r\n<img width=\"1403\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-26 at 5 45 01 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/715f74a8-9e49-4c05-80ef-5531d2e68220\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## PySpark API reference (less readable compare to pandas / no light & dark mode)\r\n<img width=\"1312\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-26 at 5 43 48 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/722d2b61-e231-4387-a5ab-dcd447045d94\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy updating the `Sphinx` and `Jinja2` versions, we can significantly improve the documentation's layout, design, and interactive features, thereby enhancing the end-user experience.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo API changes, but users will notice a more modern and user-friendly interface in the PySpark documentation. New features like light/dark mode and improved page layouts will be available as below:\r\n\r\n## Before\r\n<img width=\"1312\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-26 at 5 43 48 AM\"

tested combinations between various `Jinja2`, `Sphinx` and `pydata_sphinx_theme` versions for best document rendering.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThere are a lot of `[string|array].size` called.\r\nIn fact, the size calls the underlying length, this behavior increase the stack length.\r\nWe should call `[string|array].length` directly.\r\nWe also get the compile waring `Replace .size with .length on arrays and strings`\r\n\r\nThis PR just improve the core module.\r\n\r\n### Why are the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to refactor the script used to generate the [Supported pandas API](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/supported_pandas_api.html) documentation. The script has been restructured for better readability and maintainability. The refactoring includes:\r\n\r\n- Simplifying complex functions and breaking them into smaller, more manageable pieces.\r\n- Improving variable and function naming for clarity.\r\n- Adding comprehensive docstrings in the NumPy docstyle.\r\n- Streamlining the flow of the script to enhance logical coherence.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe previous version of the script was hard to understand and maintain due to its complexity and lack of documentation. This refactoring makes the script more accessible to new contributors and easier to modify or extend in the future. It also ensures that the script adheres to best practices in Python coding, making it a more reliable tool for generating accurate and up-to-date documentation.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo user-facing changes. This PR only affects the internal documentation generation process.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested by generating the documentation manually and verifying that the output remains consistent with the previous version.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-25T10:06:44Z","updated_at":"2024-01-01T23:41:59Z","closed_at":"2023-11-27T00:00:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"0b616d65699a562e3af9a33aa5bf94f023c30087","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to upgrade `set` from 1.9.3 to 1.9.7.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPreviously, we couldn't upgrade SBT due to its issues like the dependency resolution. SBT 1.9.7 is updated with Coursier 2.1.7.\r\n- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.7\r\n  - https://github.com/sbt/sbt/pull/7392\r\n\r\nIn addition, the following is the list of previous release notes.\r\n- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.6\r\n- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.5 (This was an officially broken release)\r\n  > Update: ⚠️ sbt 1.9.5 is broken, because it causes Scala compiler to generate wrong class names for anonymous class on lambda. While we investigate please refrain from publishing libraries with it.\r\n- https://github.com/sbt/sbt/releases/tag/v1.9.4\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds a check for overflows when creating Parquet row group filters on an INT32 (byte/short/int) parquet type to avoid incorrectly skipping row groups if the predicate value doesn't fit in an INT. This can happen if the read schema is specified as LONG, e.g via `.schema(\"col LONG\")`\r\nWhile the Parquet readers don't support reading INT32 into a LONG, the overflow can lead to row groups being incorrectly skipped, bypassing the reader altogether and producing incorrect results instead of failing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nReading a parquet file containing INT32 values with a read schema specified as LONG can produce incorrect results today:\r\n```\r\nSeq(0).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a LONG\").parquet(path).where(s\"a < ${Long.MaxValue}\").collect()\r\n```\r\nwill return an empty result. The correct result is either:\r\n- Failing the query if the parquet reader doesn't support upcasting integers to longs (all parquet readers in Spark today)\r\n- Return result `[0]` if the parquet reader supports that upcast (no readers in Spark as of now, but I'm looking into adding this capability).\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThe following: \r\n```\r\nSeq(0).toDF(\"a\").write.parquet(path)\r\nspark.read.schema(\"a LONG\").parquet(path).where(s\"a < ${Long.MaxValue}\").collect()\r\n```\r\nproduces an (incorrect) empty result before this change. After this change, the read will fail, raising an error about the unsupported conversion from INT to LONG in the parquet reader.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Added tests to `ParquetFilterSuite` to ensure that no row group filter is created when the predicate value overflows or when the value type isn't compatible with the parquet type\r\n- Added test to `ParquetQuerySuite` covering the correctness issue described above.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-24T15:25:25Z","updated_at":"2023-12-04T23:34:29Z","closed_at":"2023-12-02T19:14:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8873b31fa3d2d946a4bda47d8fd87cae5aa37929","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44006/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44006/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44006/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/8744cc2ef9781a82bdf39ecd6fc158636536f9ab","head":{"label":"johanl-db:SPARK-46092-row-group-skipping-overflow","ref":"SPARK-46092-row-group-skipping-overflow","sha":"8744cc2ef9781a82bdf39ecd6fc158636536f9ab","user":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":556757623,"node_id":"R_kgDOIS9ydw","name":"spark","full_name":"johanl-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"johanl-db","id":112876214,"node_id":"U_kgDOBrpatg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/112876214?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db","html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/johanl-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/johanl-db/spark","description":"Apache

For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nHere is a user case,\r\n\r\nFor spark on kubernetes, we leverage hostPath as spark local dirs.\r\n\r\nBut we do not mount the sub host paths directly to the pod, we mount a root path for spark driver/executor pod.\r\n\r\nFor example, the root host path is `/hadoop`.\r\n\r\nAnd there are several sub disks under that, likes `hadoop/1, /hadoop/2, /hadoop/3, /hadoop4`.\r\n\r\nAnd we have different machine models, some nodes have 4 disks and some nodes have 12 disks, so the sub disks numbers are different for different nodes.\r\n\r\nSo we want to define the SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS in the driver/executor pod env, the non-existing sub disks defined in `SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS` will be ignored, so that we can define the same container SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS env in the pod template for different machine models.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/132bb63a897f4f4049f34deefc065ed3eac6a90f/core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/storage/DiskBlockManager.scala#L250-L262\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, the user defined container SPARK_LOCAL_DIRS env will be combined into final spark local dirs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please

As described in jira [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-46036), raise_error with custom error-class parameter was deemed to be too powerful with concern that user might throw internal system errors which shouldn't be exposed to external layers.\r\n\r\nWith this change, from external perspective, we revert to the old behaviour, where raise_error only accepts single string argument which will represent message of `USER_RAISED_EXCEPTION` exception object.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nYes, we introduce change in raise_error signature. With this change it is no longer allowed to call:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT raise_error('VIEW_NOT_FOUND', Map('relationName', '`v`'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, only allowed version will be:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT raise_error('custom error message'))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich will result in `USER_RAISED_EXCEPTION` being thrown with provided message.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe change updates existing sql tests under misc-functions.sql and adds some new checks.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for details.\r\n-->\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-24T13:48:15Z","updated_at":"2023-11-29T11:52:03Z","closed_at":"2023-11-29T11:52:03Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7fe56ddb23dc1836a88af60b13f51b8c01da86e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44004/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/44004/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/44004/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/cfe2f00ed3cd30f61ece802d419603bd1f351ac5","head":{"label":"dbatomic:SPARK-46036-raise-error","ref":"SPARK-46036-raise-error","sha":"cfe2f00ed3cd30f61ece802d419603bd1f351ac5","user":{"login":"dbatomic","id":150942779,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP80Ow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150942779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic","html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":722092520,"node_id":"R_kgDOKwpB6A","name":"spark","full_name":"dbatomic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dbatomic","id":150942779,"node_id":"U_kgDOCP80Ow","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/150942779?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic","html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dbatomic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dbatomic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a separate way of configuring the private key for RPC SSL support when using openssl.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nRight now with config inheritance we support:\r\n\r\n* JKS with password A, PEM with password B\r\n* JKS with no password, PEM with password A\r\n* JKS and PEM with no password\r\n \r\n\r\nBut we do not support the case where JKS has a password and PEM does not. If we set `keyPassword` we will attempt to use it, and cannot set `spark.ssl.rpc.keyPassword` to null to override the password. So let's make it a separate flag as the easiest workaround.\r\n\r\nThis was noticed while migrating some existing deployments to the RPC SSL support where we use openssl support for RPC and use a key with no password\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, this affects how the (currently unreleased) RPC SSL feature is configured going forward\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUpdated test configs to match the issue I saw, which would fail `SSLFactory.init()` saying key was invalid.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr fixes a potential non-atomic operation issue in `ReloadingX509TrustManager`: the two `volatile` variables `reloadCount` and `reloadCount` are operated on non-atomically without `synchronized` in the code. Although these two variables are only accessed serially in test cases now and will not cause data inconsistency issues, there is still a lack of mechanism to ensure that they will always to be accessed serially in the future. Therefore, this pr replaces `volatile int` with `AtomicInteger` type to eliminate this potential hidden issue.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nFix potential non-atomic operation

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to fix a critical issue in the [Supported pandas API documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/user_guide/pandas_on_spark/supported_pandas_api.html) where many essential APIs such as `DataFrame.max`, `DataFrame.min`, `DataFrame.mean`, `and DataFrame.median`, etc. were incorrectly marked as not implemented - marked as \"N\" - as below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"291\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 12 37 49 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/95c5785c-711c-400c-b2ec-0db034e90fd8\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The root cause of this issue was that the script used to generate the support list excluded functions inherited from parent classes. For instance, `CategoricalIndex.max` is actually supported by inheriting the `Index` class but was not directly implemented in `CategoricalIndex`, leading to it being marked as unsupported:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"397\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 12 30 08 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/90e92996-a88a-4a20-bb0c-4909097e2688\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe current documentation inaccurately represents the state of supported pandas API, which could significantly hinder user experience and adoption. By correcting these inaccuracies, we ensure that the documentation reflects the true capabilities of Pandas API on Spark, providing users with reliable and accurate information.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This PR only updates the documentation to accurately reflect the current state of supported pandas API.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually build documentation, and check if the supported pandas API list is correctly generated as below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"299\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 12 36 31 PM\"

tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-24T03:39:14Z","updated_at":"2024-01-01T23:41:28Z","closed_at":"2023-11-24T10:38:40Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"410320660314e87869be92dff51d0f10b8f46291","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to update the description of the `UnknownException` class in the PySpark documentation. The current description, \"None of the above exceptions.\", is being changed to \"None of the other exceptions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe existing description, \"None of the above exceptions.\", implies that `UnknownException` does not cover any exceptions listed after it in the documentation. This can be misleading as there may be other exceptions defined below `UnknownException` as below:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"757\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-24 at 11 11 26 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/44108233/93483c7e-1be0-41b1-8a74-7a667e8c603c\">\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed change to \"None of the other exceptions.\" provides a clearer and more accurate description, ensuring that it encompasses all exceptions not covered by previously listed specific exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it only involves a minor update to the documentation for clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should pass, especially PySpark documentation build.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-24T02:12:51Z","updated_at":"2024-01-01T23:41:30Z","closed_at":"2023-11-24T02:15:51Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e18b22b281e1d2096467703f5871ab95f7579ba8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43994/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43994/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43994/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/24a368a7641a92647de68db7a1d36a8e0f91a70b","head":{"label":"itholic:unknownexception_desc","ref":"unknownexception_desc","sha":"24a368a7641a92647de68db7a1d36a8e0f91a70b","user":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":445423122,"node_id":"R_kgDOGoyeEg","name":"spark","full_name":"itholic/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"itholic","id":44108233,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ0MTA4MjMz","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44108233?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic","html_url":"https://github.com/itholic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/itholic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/itholic/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to refactor data type casting operation - especially `DataTypeOps.astype` -  for Categorical type.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo optimize performance/debuggability/readability by using official API. We can leverage the PySpark API `coalesce` and `create_map `, instead of implementing Python code from scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, it's internal optimization.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe existing CI should pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-24T01:56:53Z","updated_at":"2024-01-01T23:41:30Z","closed_at":"2023-11-24T06:06:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"cef8fea1b62354c6954ca9902b6f824f6277d53a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4138679613,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs72rz09","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PANDAS%20API%20ON%20SPARK","name":"PANDAS

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to use `DEDICATED_JVM_SBT_TESTS` environment variable in `build_java21.yml` to stabilize the following flaky test suites. Note that this is also flaky in other pipelines. The reason why we add this to `Java 21` build only is to focus on Java 21 issues in this pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo stabilize those test suites in order to focus Java 21 issues in this pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPR builder CI is irrelevant to this PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nRelax access constraints on fields of FileStreamSink so the class is extendable, split long method into two methods. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nI need to extend FileStreamSink, but it's not possible because of no access to fields of this class. This cosmetic change allows developer to reuse code of FileStreamSink- use output metadatalog of of the box in particular.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNot needed, it's change for developers on reusing code. Logic was not changed.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-23T21:30:34Z","updated_at":"2024-03-04T00:18:54Z","closed_at":"2024-03-04T00:18:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"7e997dc51a6340a15308fe5baab062efb8099a75","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1406587328,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NTg3MzI4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/STRUCTURED%20STREAMING","name":"STRUCTURED

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is factored out from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43913 and is a continuation to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43546 when SparkConnectSessionManager was introduced.\r\n\r\nWe want to remove the use a Guava cache as session cache, and have our custom logic with more control. This refactors the Session Manager and adds more tests.\r\n\r\nWe introduce a mechanism that mirrors SparkConnectExecutionManager instead.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nWith guava cache, only a single \"inactivity timeout\" can be specified for the whole cache. This can't be for example overriden per session. The actual invalidation also happens not in it's own thread inside guava, but it's work-stealing lazily piggy backed to other operations on the cache, making it opaque when session removal will actually happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nSparkConnectSessionManagerSuite added.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nGithub Copilot was assisting in some boilerplate auto-completion.\r\n\r\nGenerated-by: Github

Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

This only manifests as an issue when codegen is disabled and an array or struct contains Variant values.\r\n\r\n2) Define and use a `ParquetGroupConverter` for Variant.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nUpdate the error message for 'FAILED_EXECUTE_UDF' with the underlying error\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe Spark Connect client does not receive the underlying cause for a UDF failure.\r\nThis means that a user needs to go into the driver logs to identify the cause for\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nUpdate the error message so that the underlying exception's message is included.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes. This changes the error message that the user sees when a UDF fails. A new error\r\nparameter is added but the SQL state and existing parameters are unchanged and should\r\ncause no regressions.\r\n\r\nThe error message prior to this change:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 3 in stage 0.0 failed 1 times, most recent failure: Lost task 3.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 3) (192.168.188.21 executor driver): org.apache.spark.SparkException: [FAILED_EXECUTE_UDF] Failed to execute user defined function (` (cmd2$Helper$$Lambda$2170/0x000000f001d23000)`: (int) => int). SQLSTATE: 39000\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample of the new error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkException: [FAILED_EXECUTE_UDF] User defined function (` (cmd2$Helper$$Lambda$2422/0x0000007001ec1a10)`: (int) => int) failed due to: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/nija/test/MyClass. SQLSTATE: 39000\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested manually by running a [local connect server] and [connect client REPL]\r\n\r\n[local connect server]: https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/connector/connect/bin/spark-connect-shell\r\n[connect client REPL]:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJust like [[SPARK-42597][SQL] Support unwrap date type to timestamp type](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40190), this PR enhance `UnwrapCastInBinaryComparison` to support unwrap timestamp type to date type.\r\n\r\nAdd two new expressions:\r\n1. floorDate: the largest date that is less than or equal to the input timestamp.\r\n2. dateAddOne: floorDate + one day.\r\n3. isStartOfDay: return true if ts == floorDate\r\n\r\nThe way to unwrap timestamp type to date type are:\r\n\r\n1. CAST(date AS timestamp) > ts ===> date > floorDate\r\n2. CAST(date AS timestamp) >= ts ===> if(isStartOfDay) date >= floorDate else date >= dateAddOne\r\n3. CAST(date AS timestamp) === ts ===>\r\n        if (isStartOfDay) {\r\n          fromExp === floorDate\r\n        } else if (!fromExp.nullable) {\r\n          FalseLiteral\r\n        } else {\r\n          fromExp === floorDate AND fromExp === dateAddOne\r\n        }\r\n4. CAST(date AS timestamp) <=> ts ===> if (isStartOfDay) date <=> floorDate else FalseLiteral\r\n5. CAST(date AS timestamp) < ts ===> if(isStartOfDay) date < floorDate else date < dateAddOne\r\n6. CAST(date AS timestamp) <= ts ===> date <= floorDate\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nImprove query performance.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit

Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nI'm adding official documentation of the natural sort order of structs. The natural order terminology itself is never defined in the documentation, but this is a start\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nContinuing from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43871 , we should clarify what the the natural order of a struct is. Instead of doing it in individual SQL functions, we can add a general statement in the data type document. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nIt improves the documentation\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

changes needed?\r\nWhen executing the toJSON method on an expression nested in more than one case when, it is easy to cause OOM because the child expression is expanded multiple times.\r\neg. \r\n```\r\nCASE \r\n    WHEN(`cost` <= 250) THEN '(245-250]'\r\n    ELSE CASE \r\n        WHEN(`cost` <= 255) THEN '(250-255]'\r\n            ELSE CASE \r\n                WHEN(`cost` <= 260) THEN '(255-260]'\r\n                    ELSE CASE\r\n                        WHEN(`cost` <= 265) THEN '(260-265]'\r\n                        ELSE '----' \r\n                    END \r\n

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nCompile the regex patterns used in `SparkDateTimeUtils.getZoneId` outside of the method, that can be called for each dataset row..\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n`String.replaceFirst` internally does `Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(this).replaceFirst(replacement)`. `Pattern.compile` is very expensive method, that should not be called in a loop. \r\n\r\nWhen using method like `from_utc_timestamp` with non-literal timezone, the `SparkDateTimeUtils.getZoneId` is called for each loop. In one of my usecases adding `from_utc_timestamp` increased the runtime from 15min to 6h. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nPerformance improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting UTs\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to move out EliminateEventTimeWatermark to the analyzer (one of the analysis rule), and also make a change to eliminate EventTimeWatermark node only when the child of EventTimeWatermark is \"resolved\".\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently, we apply EliminateEventTimeWatermark immediately when withWatermark is called, which means the rule is applied immediately against the child, regardless whether child is resolved or not.\r\n\r\nIt is not an issue for the usage of DataFrame API initiated by read / readStream, because streaming sources have the flag isStreaming set to true even it is yet resolved. But mix-up of SQL and DataFrame API would expose the issue; we may not know the exact value of isStreaming flag on unresolved node and it is subject to change upon resolution.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UTs.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to sync the flag `isStreaming` from CTE definition to CTE reference. \r\n\r\nThe essential issue is that CTE reference node cannot determine the flag `isStreaming` by itself, and never be able to have a proper value and always takes the default as it does not have a parameter in constructor. The other flag `resolved` is handled, and we need to do the same for `isStreaming`.\r\n\r\nOnce we add the parameter to the constructor, we will also need to make sure the flag is in sync with CTE definition. We have a rule `ResolveWithCTE` doing the sync, hence we add the logic to sync the flag `isStreaming` as well.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe bug may impact some rules which behaves differently depending on isStreaming flag. It would no longer be a problem once CTE reference is replaced with CTE definition at some point in \"optimization phase\", but all rules in analyzer and optimizer being triggered before the rule takes effect may misbehave based on incorrect isStreaming flag.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew UT.\r\n\r\n###

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43955\r\n\r\nIn grpc 1.56, when calling a server streaming RPC like `client.execute`, the request would not be send to server until the first interaction with the resulting iterator (next or hasNext). In grpc 1.59, it appears that the request is send to the server immediately. See https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/issues/10697.\r\n\r\nI propose to embrace this new behaviour. I found it weird that calling `client.execute()` before wouldn't send the query to server until the first `hasNext()`. All the public APIs except for `toLocalIterator` consume the result immediately, so this change does not affect user facing behavior, except for the `toLocalIterator` change described below.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTest and fix behavior after grpc upgrade.\r\n\r\nTested that reverting grpc to 1.56 makes the requests not be submitted by just calling `client.execute()`:\r\n```\r\n[info] - Execute is sent eagerly to the server upon iterator creation *** FAILED *** (30 seconds, 445 milliseconds)\r\n[info]   The code passed to eventually never returned normally. Attempted 1941 times over 30.009993892 seconds. Last failure message: List() had length 0 instead of expected length 1. (SparkConnectServiceE2ESuite.scala:39)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new tests added in SparkConnectClientSuite test that the error is thrown from the response iterator, and not directly when creating the iterator. GrpcRetryHandler and ExecutePlanResponseReattachableIterator rely on that assumption. Since it holds, they don't need changes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\nCalling `dataset.toLocalIterator` used in Spark Connect used to not send the query to the server until the resulted iterator was attempted to be opened with `hasNext` or `next`. Now, the query will be submitted upon the call to `toLocalIterator`.\r\nNote that the behavior of `toLocalIterator` in Spark Connect was already different from non-Spark Connect. In non-Spark Connect, the query would be executed wholly lazily, submitting every result task as a separate job on demand as the iterator progressed. In Spark Connect, once the query was submitted to the server, the execution was not lazy.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded tests and tweaked existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nI am using Github Copilot in my IDE. It helps auto-complete some trivial boilerplate code.\r\nGenerated-by: Github

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change adds the base changes for the new `transformWithState` streaming operator used for enhanced arbitrary stateful processing. As part of this base change, we add support only for RocksDB state store provider and with/without changelog checkpointing enabled. Part of this, we introduce support for column families for this provider. Currently, this needs to be enabled/used on a per operator basis and the new operator will be the only one to use this right away. We also add support for basic single value ValueState types used for interacting with state. We also add signatures for the rest of the `StatefulProcessor` based APIs required for the new  `transformWithState` operator. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThese changes are part of the work around adding new stateful streaming operator for arbitrary state mgmt that provides a bunch of new features listed in the SPIP JIRA here - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45939\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes\r\nThis PR introduces a new operator that users can use in their Spark streaming queries\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded bunch of changes to existing tests around RocksDBStateStoreSuite and others. Also added new suites for ValueState, new operator etc\r\n\r\n```\r\n===== POSSIBLE THREAD LEAK IN SUITE o.a.s.sql.streaming.TransformWithStateSuite, threads: ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-4

Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe scenario is a bit more complicated than what the title says but it's not that far fetched. \r\n\r\n1. Write a parquet file with one column\r\n1.  Evolve the schema and add a new column with DecimalType wide enough that it doesn't fit in a long and has a default value. \r\n1. Try to read the file with the new schema\r\n1.  NPE \r\n\r\nThe issue lies in how the column vector stores default DecimalTypes. It incorrectly assumes that they always fit in a int/long and try to write it to associated array.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/sql/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/vectorized/WritableColumnVector.java#L724\r\n\r\n\r\nIn `OnHeapColumnVector`, which extends `WritableColumVector`, `reserveInternal()` checks if the type is too wide and initializes the array elements. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/b568ba43f0dd80130bca1bf86c48d0d359e57883/sql/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/vectorized/OnHeapColumnVector.java#L568\r\n\r\n`isArray()` returns true if the type is `byteArrayDecimalType`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/afebf8e6c9f24d264580d084cb12e3e6af120a5a/sql/core/src/main/java/org/apache/spark/sql/execution/vectorized/WritableColumnVector.java#L945\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Rewrite Catalog Database APIs implementation to use ResolvedNamespace to get metadata instead of directly calling catalog  \r\n- Add a boolean flag `fetchMetadata` in `UnresolvedNamespace`\r\n- Add a metadata field in `ResolvedNamespace`\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- Less duplicate logics. We should not directly invoke catalog APIs, but go through analyzer.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, the implementation of the `prepare` of all the `OffsetWindowFunctionFrame` have the same code logic show below.\r\n```\r\n  override def prepare(rows: ExternalAppendOnlyUnsafeRowArray): Unit = {\r\n    if (offset > rows.length) {\r\n      fillDefaultValue(EmptyRow)\r\n    } else {\r\n      resetStates(rows)\r\n      if (ignoreNulls) {\r\n        ...\r\n      } else {\r\n        ...\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThis PR want unify the prepare framework for `OffsetWindowFunctionFrame`\r\n\r\n**Why the https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43507 introduces the NPE bug?**\r\nFor example, there is a window group with the offset 5 and have 4 elements.\r\nFirst, we don't call the `resetStates` due to the offset is greater than 4.\r\nAfter that, we iterates the elements of the window group by visit input. But the input is null.\r\n\r\nThis PR also add two test cases about the absolute value of offset greater than the window group size.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nUnify the prepare framework for `OffsetWindowFunctionFrame`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nInner update.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support `DEDICATED_JVM_SBT_TESTS` environment variable to accept a class to run in a dedicated JVM Scala test.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n- `SERIAL_SBT_TESTS` environment variable allows users to run SBT test in a serial way.\r\n- By default, SBT test runs in a parallel way in two default groups, `default_test_group` and `hive_execution_test_group`, with the following static list of exception.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/06635e25f170e61f6cfe53232d001993ec7d376d/project/SparkBuild.scala#L522-L547\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, the users can add their own classes on demand

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the request stream iterator within `ExecutePlanResponseReattachableIterator` explicitly lazy. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the previous behaviour at gRPC 1.56.0. After upgrading gRPC from 1.56.0 to 1.59.3, it makes the first request when the stream is created, but our code here assumes that no request is made before that.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, the upgrade (SPARK-46039) has not been released out yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFixed unittests. I manually debugged via IDE.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNp.","created_at":"2023-11-22T08:54:41Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:47:43Z","closed_at":"2023-11-22T10:15:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4b29bc16f1ac3a9f6365104f1eaab25d26f31216","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43955/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43955/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43955/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9f0fa96053c1f447472f5216d854e3c215c6e47d","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-46042","ref":"SPARK-46042","sha":"9f0fa96053c1f447472f5216d854e3c215c6e47d","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the interface `TaskScheduler.killAllTaskAttempts` and its implementations. And replace it with `TaskScheduler.cancelTasks`. This PR also removes \"abort stage\" from `TaskScheduler.cancelTasks` but move it to after the call of `TaskScheduler.cancelTasks` with a control flag `spark.legacy.scheduler.stage.abortAfterCancelTasks` (`true` by default to keep the same behaviour for now). Because \"abort stage\" is not necessary while canceling tasks, see the comment at https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43954#discussion_r1402869071.\r\n\r\nBesides, this PR fixes a bug which pontentially launching new tasks after killing all the tasks in the stage attempt. This PR fixes it by marking it as zombie (i.e., `suspend()`) after the killing.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSpark has two functions to kill all tasks in a Stage:\r\n* `cancelTasks`: Not only kill all the running tasks in all the stage attempts but also abort all the stage attempts\r\n*  `killAllTaskAttempts`: Only kill all the running tasks in all the stage attemtps but won't abort the attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there's no use case in Spark that a stage would launch new tasks after its all tasks get killed. So I think we can replace `killAllTaskAttempts` with `cancelTasks` directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo. `TaskScheduler` is internal.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPass existing tests.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for
