For example, to match by classname <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, use document.select(&quot;p.one\\.two&quot;);\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/838\">jhy/jsoup#838</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, wrap text that follows a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1858\">jhy/jsoup#1858</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, normalize newlines that follow self-closing tags in custom tags.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1852\">jhy/jsoup#1852</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, collapse non-significant whitespace between a block and an inline tag.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1802\">jhy/jsoup#1802</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#forEach and Node#forEachNode, use java.util.function.Consumer instead of the previous\nAndroid compatibility shim org.jsoup.helper.Consumer. Subsequently, the latter has been deprecated.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1870\">jhy/jsoup#1870</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a new method Document#forms(), to conveniently retrieve a List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> containing the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nelements in a document.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a new method Document#expectForm(query), to find the first matching FormElement, or blow up\ntrying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: URLs containing characters such as [ and ] were not escaped correctly, and would throw a\nMalformedURLException when fetched.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1873\">jhy/jsoup#1873</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: Element.cssSelector would create invalid selectors for elements where the tag name, ID, or classnames needed\nto be escaped (e.g. if a class name contained a ':' or '.').\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1742\">jhy/jsoup#1742</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: element.text() should have a space between a block and an inline element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1877\">jhy/jsoup#1877</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if a Node or an Element was replaced with itself, that node would incorrectly be orphaned.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1843\">jhy/jsoup#1843</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: form data on a previous request was copied to a new request in newRequest(), resulting in an accumulation of\nform data when executing multi-step form submissions, or data sent to later requests incorrectly. Now, newRequest()\nonly copies session related settings (cookies, proxy settings, user-agent, etc) but not the request data nor the\nbody.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1778\">jhy/jsoup#1778</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: fixed an issue in Safelist.removeAttributes which could throw a ConcurrentModificationException when using\nthe &quot;:all&quot; pseudo-attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: given extremely deeply nested HTML, a number of methods in Element could throw a StackOverflowError due</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

For example, to match by classname <!-- raw HTML omitted -->, use document.select(&quot;p.one\\.two&quot;);\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/838\">jhy/jsoup#838</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, wrap text that follows a <!-- raw HTML omitted --> tag.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1858\">jhy/jsoup#1858</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, normalize newlines that follow self-closing tags in custom tags.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1852\">jhy/jsoup#1852</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: when pretty-printing, collapse non-significant whitespace between a block and an inline tag.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1802\">jhy/jsoup#1802</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: in Element#forEach and Node#forEachNode, use java.util.function.Consumer instead of the previous\nAndroid compatibility shim org.jsoup.helper.Consumer. Subsequently, the latter has been deprecated.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1870\">jhy/jsoup#1870</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a new method Document#forms(), to conveniently retrieve a List<!-- raw HTML omitted --> containing the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->\nelements in a document.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improvement: added a new method Document#expectForm(query), to find the first matching FormElement, or blow up\ntrying.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: URLs containing characters such as [ and ] were not escaped correctly, and would throw a\nMalformedURLException when fetched.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1873\">jhy/jsoup#1873</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: Element.cssSelector would create invalid selectors for elements where the tag name, ID, or classnames needed\nto be escaped (e.g. if a class name contained a ':' or '.').\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1742\">jhy/jsoup#1742</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: element.text() should have a space between a block and an inline element.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1877\">jhy/jsoup#1877</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: if a Node or an Element was replaced with itself, that node would incorrectly be orphaned.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1843\">jhy/jsoup#1843</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: form data on a previous request was copied to a new request in newRequest(), resulting in an accumulation of\nform data when executing multi-step form submissions, or data sent to later requests incorrectly. Now, newRequest()\nonly copies session related settings (cookies, proxy settings, user-agent, etc) but not the request data nor the\nbody.\n<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1778\">jhy/jsoup#1778</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: fixed an issue in Safelist.removeAttributes which could throw a ConcurrentModificationException when using\nthe &quot;:all&quot; pseudo-attribute.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bugfix: given extremely deeply nested HTML, a number of methods in Element could throw a StackOverflowError due</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...
