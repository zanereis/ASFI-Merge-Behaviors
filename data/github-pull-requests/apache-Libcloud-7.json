Implement OpenStackv2 port attaching/detaching\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdds Port Interface calls for the OpenStack v2 driver. Similar in\r\nfunctionality to floating IPs (can be attached / detached from a\r\ncompute instance to move IPs between instances) but a bit different.\r\n\r\n> A port is a connection point for attaching a single device, such as the\r\n> NIC of a server, to a network. The port also describes the associated\r\n> network configuration, such as the MAC and IP addresses to be used on\r\n> that port.\r\nhttps://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/pike/cli/command-objects/port.html\r\n\r\nAlso see:\r\nhttps://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/#port-interfaces-servers-os-interface\r\n\r\nThis commit adds:\r\n- a connection to the neutron network API for functionality that is not exposed through\r\nthe nova compute api\r\n- an OpenStack_2_PortInterface object\r\n- an OpenStack_2_PortInterfaceState object for port interface states\r\n- an ex_list_ports method (via the neutron api)\r\n- an ex_delete_port method (via the neutron api)\r\n- an ex_detach_port_interface method (via the nova api)\r\n- an ex_attach_port_interface method (via the nova api)\r\n\r\nlooks like:\r\n\r\nlisting and deleting a port\r\n```\r\nIn [2]: conn.ex_list_ports()\r\nOut[2]: \r\n[<OpenStack_2_PortInterface: id=586da55e-cfcb-41c8-ae39-a26cb8a7e723, state=build, driver=OpenStack

add ex_get_node_details for digitalocean_v2 driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAdds ex_get_node_details for the digitalocean_v2 driver. This method already\r\nexists for other drivers like [OpenStack](https://github.com/apache/libcloud/blob/e2e17414dd9e8ba3542e181885ec242b820bfc48/libcloud/compute/drivers/openstack.py#L317).\r\n\r\nRight now to list one node object using the DigitalOcean driver you can\r\nrun .list_nodes and then filter out the one you need by ID. This works\r\nfine, but once start using that on accounts with many instances (thousands)\r\nthat will becomes slow and the chance of encountering API exceptions goes\r\nup and you end up with frequent errors like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn connection.list_nodes()\r\nFile \"/usr/local/venv/project/src/apache-libcloud/libcloud/compute/drivers/digitalocean.py\", line 349, in list_nodes\r\ndata = self._paginated_request('/v2/droplets', 'droplets')\r\nFile \"/usr/local/venv/project/src/apache-libcloud/libcloud/common/digitalocean.py\", line 242, in _paginated_request\r\nnew_data = self.connection.request(url, params=params)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/venv/project/src/apache-libcloud/libcloud/common/base.py\", line 862, in request\r\nresponse = responseCls(**kwargs)\r\nFile \"/usr/local/venv/project/src/apache-libcloud/libcloud/common/base.py\", line 179, in __init__\r\nheaders=self.headers)\r\nBaseHTTPError: Server was unable to give you a response. (code: 500)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr also very often:\r\n```\r\nMalformedResponseError: <MalformedResponseException in <project.provisioning.driver.digitalocean.DigitalOcean_v2_NodeDriver object at 0x4f1c290> 'Failed to parse JSON'>: '<!DOCTYPE html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n  <title>DigitalOcean - Something went wrong!</\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing .ex_get_node_details instead of .list_nodes when you need to retrieve a\r\nnode object by droplet ID will make that action faster and less likely to fail.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\nIn [13]: conn.ex_get_node_details('7772242')\r\nOut[13]: <Node: uuid=2aa2a2834970788c565aaf3ccd0b148dd51ce777, name=testnode, state=RUNNING, public_ips=[u'37.123.0.123'], private_ips=[], provider=DigitalOcean ...>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for

Fix LIBCLOUD-997, implements LIBCLOUD-998 and LIBCLOUD-604\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n#### LIBCLOUD-604:\r\n\r\nAdd equivalent function for returning listed subnets in OpenStack driver. Similar to `ex_list_subnet` for EC2 endpoint providers.\r\n\r\n#### LIBCLOUD-997:\r\n\r\nThe OpenStack_2_NodeDriver uses two connections\r\n\r\nthe base class connection attribute and a new one: image_connection.\r\n\r\nIn this case if the user has specified the ex_force_base_url one of them will fail, as both uses the same base url, but there are different services with different urls.  If the user set the compute base url (the standard case) the image one will not work a viceversa\r\n\r\n#### LIBCLOUD-998:\r\nOpenStack_2_NodeDriver class uses the deprecated path \"/os-networks\" of the compute API instead of using the \"/v2.0/networks\" of the neutron API that i the current one.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that

Support GCP service_account authentication from JSON obj/str\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently GCP service_account authentication credentials can be provided using the JSON/PEM file acquired from GCP console or gcloud utility. It would be convenient if the JSON content could be directly provided as an object or serialized JSON string to eliminate the need of having the file locally on the calling host.\r\n\r\nIn this PR:\r\n- add logic to support JSON dict and str handling\r\n- rearrange PEM/JSON related GCE_PARAMS_* constant names in test_google.py for better clarity\r\n- add tests for JSON content as a dict and as a str\r\n\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

than in `ec2.py`\r\nI placed the output in libcloud/compute/constants.py (maybe bad?)\r\n- I cleaned `ec2.py` from the big dicts configuring sizes and region\r\nI import from constants and just add things not related to AWS (nimbus)\r\n- Updated tests\r\nTests were too static, so I deleted some.\r\nI also disable lint on the constants file as it is autogenerated and prettified\r\nI remove some lint config from tox.ini to setup.cfg.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code

Update Azure Blobs Storage driver documentation\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe current screenshots in the Azure Blobs Storage driver documentation show an old version of the Azure portal. Some of the terminology and where to find access keys has changed, so this commit updates the screenshots and the wording in the documentation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Azure now also offers a new type of storage account called \"Blob storage\" which is not supported by the current libcloud driver implementation. This change therefore adds wording to avoid user confusion when creating a storage account for use with libcloud.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Basic support for EC2 Spot Instances\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSpot instances on AWS are a way to get cheaper nodes taking advantage of Amazon's over capacity. The downside of using this kind of instances is that whenever AWS need the allocated spot instances to deliver normal (on-demand) ones (at full price), it will shutdown them after a 2 minute period, so this has to be taken into account when designing systems so they can recover correctly.\r\n\r\nRecently, AWS was updated so that requesting Spot instances is easier than ever, the client just to add a couple of parameters to the usual RunInstances call, immediately getting an instance id from the API that can be treated as a normal Node.\r\n\r\nFor testing purposes I added a new example script that creates t2.micro spot instances.\r\n\r\nRef:\r\n* https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/new-amazon-ec2-spot-pricing/\r\n*

Fixed bug where _find_zone_or_region cannot see some instances\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe method `_find_zone_or_region` queries the google cloud api on the endpoint `instances.aggregatedList`.  \r\n\r\nThis endpoint cannot return more than 500 results but has a pagination mechanic. The method `_find_zone_or_region` does not make use of the pagination mechanic because it made a manual request to the api.\r\n\r\nI removed the manual request and replaced it by the  method `request_aggregated_items` that was made for this exact purpose.\r\n\r\nThis bug was found while trying to use the libcloud in ansible (via the gce_snapshot ansible module) and getting an error `libcloud.common.google.ResourceNotFoundError: \"Node 'node_name' not found in any zone.\"`. \r\n\r\nIndeed without the pagination, if a google cloud project has more than 500 instances, the code will crash when trying to identify the zone for a gce instance that wasn't in the 500 instances returned by the first api call. \r\n\r\nHere is the stack trace I saw : \r\n```\r\nThe full traceback

looking at:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/versioning-for-the-azure-storage-services#for-blob-storage-accounts\r\n\r\nthe easiest fix is to upgrade the api version to the minumum supported version (2014-02-12).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the other cloud drivers all provide the actual md5 hash when uploading or getting an object.  This allows the user to check if a file has changed online compared to locally.  The current master version provides the etag value as the \"hash\" attribute (interestingly with literal quotes around the tag: `'\"0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\"'`) which is not compatible with the other drivers.\r\n\r\nReplace this with the PR description (mention the changes you have made, why\r\nyou have made them, provide some background and any references to the provider\r\ndocumentation if needed, etc.).\r\n\r\nI am assuming that these are both bugs and not design decisions (if so feel free to close this request).\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist

LIBCLOUD-986: Add prefix filter for list and iterate containers to Azure Blob Storage Driver\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhile testing out the libcloud storage abstraction I've come across a curious omission in driver support. It seems that for many drivers there is additional support for the list_container_objects() and iterate_container_objects() to support a prefix (or ex_prefix). \r\n\r\nThis functionality is not present in the Azure driver for some reason.   I've gone and checked the list_blobs API and it also supports this functionality as seen here:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/list-blobs\r\n\r\nI've added the support to the AzureBlobsStorageDriver with these changes.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n- done, ready for review\r\n\r\n### Checklist\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [x]

Allow creation of MIG with an instance template whose network and subnetwork are shared from a different project\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt's currently not possible to create a Managed Instance Group with an instance template that creates instances in a network and subnetwork that are shared from a different project.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to be that, when parsing the json representing the instance group (in `_to_instancegroup`), the name part of the network (or subnetwork) is extracted from a fully qualified URL, i.e. implictly assuming that the network is under the same project that we are in. But if we're using a shared VPC, the network resource will be under a different project and we must stick to using fully qualified URL.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies the `_to_instancegroup` method so that the network and subnetwork values contained in the json representation are used as they are and passed directly to `ex_get_network` and `ex_get_subnetwork` which know how to handle fully qualified resource URLs.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone, ready for review. To be honest I am not sure the test I've added is useful, but I am not too sure about how to test this: I'll happily receive feedback.\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Fix IndexError in dimensiondata list_images\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis fix involves filtering out images from locations not returned by the list_locations API.\r\n\r\nThis is required because the CloudControl API returns all images in the target geographic region (even ones in datacenters the user's organisation does not have access to).\r\n\r\nWe therefore need to filter out those images (since we can't get a NodeLocation for them).\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone, ready for review.\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [x] [Code linting](http://libcloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development.html#code-style-guide) (required, can be done after the PR checks)\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ]

Switch to optional pytest-runner, required only for tests\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis fixes what was introduced by b4ce936: a forced dependency of the [pytest-runner](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner) for any `setup.py` target, including `build` and `install`, which is not really appropriate, since it should be required only for testing, when you invoke `python setup.py test` or its aliases.\r\n\r\nSuch a forced dependency makes distribution packaging more complicated, since pytest-runner pulls other dependencies (like setuptools_scm) which may have other dependencies or Python version requirements for no reason.\r\n\r\nIt also breaks libcloud installation on older distros (e.g. Debian Wheezy), where libcloud **2.0.0** worked just perfectly, but anything above it couldn't because pytest-runner and/or its dependencies cannot be installed.\r\n\r\nPlus, testing should always be optional.\r\n\r\nThankfully, there's an [official

Allow for use of shared network (vpc) and subnetwork in GCE\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt's currently not possible to create an GCE instance within a [shared VPC](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc) and a shared subnet via ansible although it's possible from the google compute console (see https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/30759).\r\n\r\nIn the code, the problem seems to be that even if a fully qualified resource URL is passed for a network (or subnetwork), it is parsed into parts and then reconstructed assuming the resource is under the configured gcloud project. But since we're using a shared VPC, the resource is under a different project.\r\n\r\n For example, say, I have two projects, `my-main-project` which hosts a shared vpc named `sharedvpc` and `my-other-project` which has shared access to `sharedvpc`. What I want to do is to create a GCE instance under `my-other-project` and within the `sharedvpc` network.\r\n\r\nSo in the gce module, I pass the resource URLs:\r\n```yml\r\n  - name: Create instance\r\n      gce:\r\n        instance_names: \"{{ instance_name }}\"\r\n        machine_type: \"{{ machine_type }}\"\r\n        image: \"{{ image_name }}\"\r\n        network: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-main-project/global/networks/sharedvpc\r\n        subnetwork: https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/my-main-project/regions/europe-west2/subnetworks/default\"\r\n        zone: \"{{ zone }}\"\r\n        tags: app-servers\r\n        state: present\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, in the module's code, the resource URLs will be parsed and transform respectively to `/global/networks/sharedvpc` and `/regions/europe-west2/subnetworks/default` which implicitly refer to the project configured by glcoud, i.e. `my-other-project`. As a result, I get a `ResourceNotFound` error.\r\n\r\nInstead, if a resource (network or subnetwork) is fully qualified via a resource URL (i.e. it starts with `https://`), we can simply use it in the underlying google request. This is what the new code does.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nDone, ready for review. I'm new to libcloud, so I'll happily take feedback and amend the PR.\r\n\r\n### Checklist (tick everything that applies)\r\n\r\n- [ ] [Code

Reduce `tox -e lint` verbosity\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nBy default, `python -m json.tool` prints to stdout, which makes `tox -e lint` really verbose. This change keeps the errors, if any, but discards the result. There is no automated test to add, but I did check that we were seeing the errors when the input file was not well formed. \r\n\r\n`/dev/null` won't work on Windows, but we already use /bin/bash for `tox -e docs`. Is Windows supported by libcloud? If it is, we should add Appveyor CI. At that point, I'll stop using json.tool for `tox -e lint` but will write a simple Python scripts that uses the `json`module.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\n- done, ready for
