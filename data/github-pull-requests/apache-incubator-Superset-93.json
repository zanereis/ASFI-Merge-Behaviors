SUMMARY\r\nIn `DashboardContainer` we recalculated `chartsInScope` only when scopes changed. However, when we deleted a filter and added a new one with the same scope, scopes were equal so we didn't calculate chartsInScope for the new filter. That resulted in `undefined` error. This PR adds filter's ID to scopes so that we sync `chartsInScope` when scopes change and when new filters are created\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nBefore:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/124115398-0defa900-da6e-11eb-97c7-1d08df3fd70c.mp4\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/124115617-5018ea80-da6e-11eb-97cf-5daeb622cec7.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Add a native filter\r\n2. Delete that filter and add a new one with the same scope\r\n3. Verify that charts highlighting on filter focus works as expected\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nfollowing the latest config loading mechanism changes and breaking changes and its follow-ups fixes:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15448\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15444\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15435\r\n\r\nwe wanted to propose a new way for two configurations files (.py) to be unioned \r\nand to allow flexibility to choose a strategy based on the value type\r\n\r\nAssume config.py contains  (left side)\r\nKEY1 = { ... }\r\nKEY2 = SomeClass\r\n\r\nand superset_config.py contains (right side)\r\nKEY1 = { ... }\r\nKEY2 = SomeClass\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 5 kinds of strategies how to union those KEY - Values \r\n1) take_right_strategy - simple - just override \r\n2) override_right_as_class_strategy - will create a class with the KEY name and its fields will be what inside the right value\r\n2) merge_as_class_strategy - will create a class with the KEY name and its fields will be what inside the left and right value.\r\n3) override_right_as_dict_strategy - will create a dict and its keys-values will be what inside the right value.\r\n4) merge_as_dict_strategy - will create a dict and its keys-values will be what inside the left and right value.\r\n\r\ncurrent meta configurations\r\n\r\nmeta_union_strategy = {\r\n    (type, type): override_right_as_class_strategy,\r\n    (type, dict): override_right_as_class_strategy,\r\n    (dict, type): override_right_as_class_strategy,\r\n    (dict, dict): merge_as_dict_strategy,\r\n    (Any, Any):  take_right_strategy\r\n}\r\n\r\nthis PR will in the future enables us to :\r\n1. change the strategy -\r\n2. defines new tuple and its strategy \r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING

SUMMARY\r\nWhen the `DASHBOARD_FILTERS_EXPERIMENTAL` flag is set, the filter config modal produces an error due to the experimental filters not being mapped in the `FILTER_SUPPORTED_TYPES` map.

For example, we can have languages configured in `superset/config.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nLANGUAGES = {\r\n    \"en\": {\"flag\": \"us\", \"name\": \"English\"},\r\n    \"es\": {\"flag\": \"es\", \"name\": \"Spanish\"},\r\n    \"it\": {\"flag\": \"it\", \"name\": \"Italian\"},\r\n    \"fr\": {\"flag\": \"fr\", \"name\": \"French\"},\r\n    \"zh\": {\"flag\": \"cn\", \"name\": \"Chinese\"},\r\n    \"ja\": {\"flag\": \"jp\", \"name\": \"Japanese\"},\r\n    \"de\": {\"flag\": \"de\", \"name\": \"German\"},\r\n    \"pt\": {\"flag\": \"pt\", \"name\": \"Portuguese\"},\r\n    \"pt_BR\": {\"flag\": \"br\", \"name\": \"Brazilian Portuguese\"},\r\n    \"ru\": {\"flag\": \"ru\", \"name\": \"Russian\"},\r\n    \"ko\": {\"flag\": \"kr\", \"name\": \"Korean\"},\r\n    \"sl\": {\"flag\": \"si\", \"name\": \"Slovenian\"},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a user wants to have only Brazilian Portuguese in their Superset instance they would add to their config:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nLANGUAGES = {\r\n    \"pt_BR\": {\"flag\": \"br\", \"name\": \"Brazilian Portuguese\"},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the `merge` would bring back all languages, resulting in a config that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nLANGUAGES = {\r\n    \"en\": {\"flag\": \"us\", \"name\": \"English\"},\r\n    \"es\": {\"flag\": \"es\", \"name\": \"Spanish\"},\r\n    \"it\": {\"flag\": \"it\", \"name\": \"Italian\"},\r\n    \"fr\": {\"flag\": \"fr\", \"name\": \"French\"},\r\n    \"zh\": {\"flag\": \"cn\", \"name\": \"Chinese\"},\r\n    \"ja\": {\"flag\": \"jp\", \"name\": \"Japanese\"},\r\n    \"de\": {\"flag\": \"de\", \"name\": \"German\"},\r\n    \"pt\": {\"flag\": \"pt\", \"name\": \"Portuguese\"},\r\n    \"pt_BR\": {\"flag\": \"br\", \"name\": \"Brazilian Portuguese\"},\r\n    \"ru\": {\"flag\": \"ru\", \"name\": \"Russian\"},\r\n    \"ko\": {\"flag\": \"kr\", \"name\": \"Korean\"},\r\n    \"sl\": {\"flag\": \"si\", \"name\": \"Slovenian\"},\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCSS `mask` for Icon SVG was triggering a get request to `localhost:.../Images/Icons/error.svg` and returning a 404 error. This was fixed by importing the SVG at the top of the file and adding it onto the `mask` inside the CSS variable. Some alignment was also needed on this CSS variable to get it centered in the field.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n* BEFORE:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-28 at 11 13 56 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50464395/123684346-31162080-d802-11eb-93ff-ec422c06e918.png\">\r\n\r\n* AFTER:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1440\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-28 at 11 02 50 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50464395/123684428-4c812b80-d802-11eb-8109-68f0986ca691.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nThis PR adds support for opening a dashboard with predefined filters passed via URL params. When clicking on \"Copy dashboard URL\" or \"Share dashboard by email\" in the Dashboard menu, a shortcut to an URL with RISON encoded filter state is created, which can be used to share the currently selected filters.\r\n\r\n### SCREENSHOTS\r\nWhen opening up the link, the dashboard opens up with the predefined filter selection. Notice `native_filters` in the URL params:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33317356/123650989-c8479c00-d833-11eb-887f-2860ebd12610.png)\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Open a dashboard with native filters\r\n2. Select a few filters\r\n3. Click \"Copy dashboard URL\" or \"Share dashboard by email\"\r\n4. Open the link and notice the dashboard opening with the previously selected filters. (please note: the prepopulated URL will reference port 8088 when in `dev-server` mode. So remember to manually update this to 9000 when testing locally)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are

SUMMARY\r\nDue to passing as a prop `nativeFilters` object (from redux), which changes on each focus/unfocus of native filters, from `DashboardComponent`, all dashboard components (tabs, rows, chart holders, dividers...) were being rerendered on each native filter focus. This PR optimizes that behaviour by passing `nativeFilters` only to `Tabs` component.\r\nAlso, I optimized rendering `FiltersBadge` component - due to passing complex objects as props, expensive calculations were being re-run multiple times.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Enable `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag\r\n1. Open a dashboard and add some native filters\r\n2. Focus on a native filter, verify that charts and tabs highlighting works as before (but it should be a bit faster on big dashboards, as only `FilterFocusHighlight` component gets rerendered).\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT: Include \"Fixes #nnn\" if you are fixing an existing issue -->\r\n- [ ] Has associated

SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis is addressing #15402 \r\n\r\nSQL Lab has Stop button but it only updates the state of superset without actually stopping the database query. Leaving the queries running in the background affect database performance. This PR is to stop running queries in the backend databases when:\r\n* The Stop button pressed in SQL Lab\r\n* Navigated to a new site, refreshed or closed the SQLLab browser window. This is optional and configurable per database at `Database -> Performance -> Cancel query on window unload event`.\r\n\r\nIt currently supports mysql, postgres and snowflake databases but new database support can be added easily. The PR is supporting sync and async query execution modes.\r\n\r\nThis is a refactored and extended version of the unmerged and inactive https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/7611\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n1. Run a long running query in one of the supported drivers. For example MySQL:  `SELECT sleep(60)`\r\n2. Press the Stop button, close the tab or navigate to another Superset page\r\n3. Running query should get killed automatically in the backend database. For example MySQL `SHOW PROCESSLIST` should not show the query from point 1)\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\n- [x] Has associated issue: #15402 \r\n- [x] Changes UI\r\n- [ ] Includes DB Migration (follow approval process in [SIP-59](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/13351))\r\n  - [ ] Migration is atomic, supports rollback & is backwards-compatible\r\n  - [ ] Confirm DB migration upgrade and downgrade tested\r\n  - [ ] Runtime estimates and downtime expectations provided\r\n- [x] Introduces new feature or API\r\n- [ ] Removes existing feature or API\r\n","created_at":"2021-06-27T00:38:43Z","updated_at":"2024-03-12T23:45:14Z","closed_at":"2021-07-13T16:09:22Z","merged_at":"2021-07-13T16:09:22Z","merge_commit_sha":"02032ee8a478ab9578cf6e13a7645a8b4106be58","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1331560260,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzMxNTYwMjYw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/size/L","name":"size/L","color":"6D53B9","default":false,"description":""},{"id":6578403540,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAlosUs8AAAABiBp41A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/superset/labels/%F0%9F%8F%B7%EF%B8%8F%20bot","name":"🏷️

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\n_This is a PR against a feature branch, not the main branch._\r\n\r\nAdds fuzzy search that targets plugin name, tags, and description. Improves layout and behavior of the viz picker modal overall.\r\n\r\nFuzzy search is implemented using https://fusejs.io/. This library is 300kb and will likely suffice for any frontend fuzzy search needs we may have in the other parts of Superset as well.\r\n\r\nWe were getting pretty far from the default way AntD tabs are supposed to behave, so I rolled my own tab-like logic and now it's quite a bit  cleaner.\r\n\r\nUpgraded superset-ui and used the registry's new event listener functionality in the plugin context, so that components can re-render in response to metadata changes (such as when dynamic plugins are loaded)\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n\r\nWith a category selected:\r\n<img width=\"1081\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-26 at 4 36 58 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/123528537-ddd68d80-d69c-11eb-80b7-e9c162891da0.png\">\r\n\r\nWhile searching:\r\n<img width=\"1079\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-26 at 4 37 15 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1858430/123528543-e4650500-d69c-11eb-95c5-9e5585451e58.png\">\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\nWhen user selects \"Numerical range\" native filter, only numeric columns should be available to choose. If there are no numeric columns in the dataset, show \"No columns found\" message in select column dropdown. When user has selected a non-numeric column and then changes filter type to numerical range, the column field should be reset.\r\nWe use `type_generic` field to check column's type. If a column doesn't have `type_generic` field, we assume that it's numeric as a failsafe.\r\n\r\nThank you @dpgaspar and @villebro for providing the backend code!\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15073128/123410870-15b3d700-d5b0-11eb-8895-99dd308fc558.mov\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n0. Enable `DASHBOARD_NATIVE_FILTERS` feature flag\r\n1. Create a native filter and select \"Numerical range\" filter\r\n2. Verify that only numeric columns are available to choose from (exception: some datasets from test data, like `message_channels`, have columns with `type_generic` field unset. In those cases, we display them as a failsafe)\r\n3. Change filter type to Value and verify that all columns are available, not only numeric\r\n4. Select some non-numeric column and change back to numerical range - column field should be reset.\r\n5. \r\n### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n<!--- Check any relevant boxes with \"x\" -->\r\n<!--- HINT:

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\nCurrently, the zIndex of dashboard's content is `1`, which is lower than dashboard's title panel(`2`). We should set that to higher in chart maximize mode.  In order to achieve this requirement, I put the full-size state in redux so that the parent element can get this.\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED GIF\r\n<!--- Skip this if not applicable -->\r\n### before\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/123392547-c2ea1780-d5cf-11eb-8a47-93ac1155b313.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### after\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11830681/123392569-c7163500-d5cf-11eb-9550-b28dc1f3b55b.mov\r\n\r\n\r\n### TESTING INSTRUCTIONS\r\n<!--- Required!

SUMMARY\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15322\r\n- Fixes https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/15360\r\n- Improves the header of the filters in the filter bar\r\n\r\nFixes some regressions introduced in https://github.com/apache/superset/pull/15276:\r\n- Fixes the size of the inputs in the modal\r\n- Fixes the display of the required message in the modal\r\n- Fixes the spacing of the filter items in the filter bar\r\n- When the user unchecked the required field, the application unchecked the default value. This is not the intended behavior.\r\n- Replaced the required message with an icon in the filter bar\r\n- Simplifies the logic of the required checkbox in the modal. If the user checks that a filter has a default value, then the default value is validated. If the user checks the required checkbox, the application automatically checks the default value, which will trigger the validation.\r\n\r\n@villebro @kgabryje @rusackas \r\n\r\n@jinghua-qa Can you

\r\n\r\nImprovements/tasks that will be done in the next iterations:\r\n- Add RTL tests\r\n\r\n@rusackas @geido @villebro @pkdotson @kgabryje @suddjian @zhaoyongjie \r\nThis component will be used by everyone. Please take the time to learn the API, play with the different controls, review and test.\r\n\r\nPS: Sometimes the storybook is producing a 404 error. We need to investigate that in another PR and also update the Storybook version. For now, if you find the error, you only need to delete the `.cache` folder inside `node_modules` to make it work.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR ANIMATED

SUMMARY\r\n<!--- Describe the change below, including rationale and design decisions -->\r\n\r\nAdd new custom error messaging when a query times out in SQL Lab.\r\n\r\nTimeout exceptions were not bubbling up correctly in SQL Lab, so I fixed the code to make sure they bubble from `execute_sql_statement` to `execute_sql_statements` to `get_sql_results`.\r\n\r\n### BEFORE/AFTER SCREENSHOTS OR
