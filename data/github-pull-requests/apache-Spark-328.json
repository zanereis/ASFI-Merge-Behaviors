What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves performance of operations with `range()` by changing Java code generated by Catalyst. This PR is inspired by the [blog article](https://databricks.com/blog/2017/02/16/processing-trillion-rows-per-second-single-machine-can-nested-loop-joins-fast.html).\r\n\r\nThis PR changes generated code in the following two points.\r\n1. Replace a while-loop with long instance variables a for-loop with int local varibles\r\n2. Suppress generation of `shouldStop()` method if this method is unnecessary (e.g. `append()` is not generated).\r\n\r\nThese points facilitates compiler optimizations in a JIT compiler by feeding the simplified Java code into the JIT compiler. The performance is improved by 7.6x.\r\n\r\nBenchmark program:\r\n```java\r\nval N = 1 << 29\r\nval iters = 2\r\nval benchmark = new Benchmark(\"range.count\", N * iters)\r\nbenchmark.addCase(s\"with this PR\") { i =>\r\n  var n = 0\r\n  var len = 0\r\n  while (n < iters) {\r\n    len += sparkSession.range(N).selectExpr(\"count(id)\").collect.length\r\n    n += 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nbenchmark.run\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerformance result without this PR\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_111-8u111-b14-2ubuntu0.16.04.2-b14 on Linux 4.4.0-47-generic\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz\r\nrange.count:                             Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nw/o this PR                                   1349 / 1356        796.2           1.3       1.0X\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerformance result with this PR\r\n```\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_111-8u111-b14-2ubuntu0.16.04.2-b14 on Linux 4.4.0-47-generic\r\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20GHz\r\nrange.count:                             Best/Avg Time(ms)    Rate(M/s)   Per Row(ns)   Relative\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nwith this PR                                   177 /  271       6065.3           0.2       1.0X\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a comparison between generated code w/o and with this PR.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the ALS method the default values of regParam do not match within the same file (lines [224](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/recommendation/ALS.scala#L224) and [714](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/mllib/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/ml/recommendation/ALS.scala#L714)). In one place we set it to 1.0 and in the other to 0.1.\r\n\r\nI changed the one of train() method to 0.1 and now it matches the default value which is visible to Spark users. The method is marked with DeveloperApi so it should not affect the users. Whenever we use the particular method we provide all parameters, so the default does not matter. Only exception is the unit-tests on ALSSuite but the change does not break them.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR should get the award of the laziest commit in Spark history. Originally I wanted to correct this on another PR but @MLnick [suggested](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17059#issuecomment-283333572) to create a separate PR & ticket. If you think this change is too insignificant/minor, you are probably right, so feel free to reject and close this. :)\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nToday, we compare the whole path when deciding if a file is new in the FileSource for structured streaming. However, this would cause false negatives in the case where the path has changed in a cosmetic way (i.e. changing `s3n` to `s3a`).\r\n\r\nThis patch adds an option `fileNameOnly` that causes the new file check to be based only on the filename (but still store the whole path in the log).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nspark\r\n  .readStream\r\n  .option(\"fileNameOnly\", true)\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSupport initial model for ```KMeans```.\r\n* Only ```KMeans``` (a.k.a the estimator) extends from ```HasInitialModel```, the ```KMeansModel``` does not. So ```KMeansModel``` does not have param ```initialModel```. Spark ML allow estimators and models don’t share all params (such as ```ALS``` and ```ALSModel```). The is because we don't like to make model too big, it should be shipped more easy.\r\n* Add candidate value ```initialModel``` for param ```initMode```. If users would like to start with an initial model, they should set ```initMode``` with ```initialModel```, and set ```initialModel``` to corresponding instance.\r\n* If users set ```initMode``` with ```random``` or ```kmeans||```, even they set ```initialModel``` to a model instance, we don’t use it when training model. Since users explicitly tell us they would not warm start, but we will output warning log for this case.\r\n* The ```initialModel```’s dimension should match training dataset’s number of features, otherwise, throw illegal argument exception.\r\n* The ```initialModel```’s cluster count (a.k.a ```k```) should match param ```k```, otherwise, throw illegal argument exception. The old MLlib ```KMeans``` does not allow ```k``` mismatched, so we keep consistent with it.\r\n\r\nNote: This implementation is inspired by #11119, thanks @yinxusen for the initial work.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdd unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-01T09:31:23Z","updated_at":"2017-07-12T09:30:29Z","closed_at":"2017-07-12T09:30:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4becbd4231d5b86a47d442893a79789cdd6fe45b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17117/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17117/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17117/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/7d842e0c38c3e3d1b0567378ae5a98ecc1597166","head":{"label":"yanboliang:spark-10780","ref":"spark-10780","sha":"7d842e0c38c3e3d1b0567378ae5a98ecc1597166","user":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":21890948,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTg5MDk0OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"yanboliang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"yanboliang","id":1962026,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjIwMjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1962026?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang","html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanboliang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/yanboliang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently we are running into an issue with Yarn work preserving enabled + external shuffle service.\r\nIn the work preserving enabled scenario, the failure of NM will not lead to the exit of executors, so executors can still accept and run the tasks. The problem here is when NM is failed, external shuffle service is actually inaccessible, so reduce tasks will always complain about the “Fetch failure”, and the failure of reduce stage will make the parent stage (map stage) rerun. The tricky thing here is Spark scheduler is not aware of the unavailability of external shuffle service, and will reschedule the map tasks on the executor where NM is failed, and again reduce stage will be failed with “Fetch failure”, and after 4 retries, the job is failed. This could also apply to other cluster manager with external shuffle service.\r\n\r\nSo here the main problem is that we should avoid assigning tasks to those bad executors (where shuffle service is unavailable). Current Spark's blacklist mechanism could blacklist executors/nodes by failure tasks, but it doesn't handle this specific fetch failure scenario. So here propose to improve the current application blacklist mechanism to handle fetch failure issue (especially with external shuffle service unavailable issue), to blacklist the executors/nodes where shuffle fetch is unavailable. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit test and small cluster

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSparkDataFrame in SparkR seems to accept duplicate names at creation, but incurs error when calling methods downstream. For example, we can do: \r\n```\r\nl <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))\r\ndf <- createDataFrame(l, c(\"a\", \"a\"))\r\nhead(df)\r\n```\r\nBut an error occurs when we do `df$a = df$a * 2.0`.\r\n\r\nIn

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis change addresses the renaming of the `simple.sbt` build file to\r\n`build.sbt`. Newer versions of the sbt tool are not finding the older\r\nnamed file and are looking for the `build.sbt`. The quickstart\r\ninstructions for self-contained applications is updated with this\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAs this is a relatively minor change of a few words, the markdown was checked for syntax and spelling.

`invalidateCache` to `recacheByPlan`, which is more obvious about what it does.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nnew regression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to support unicodes in Param methods in ML, other missed functions in DataFrame.\r\n\r\nFor example, this causes a `ValueError` in Python 2.x when param is a unicode string:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> from pyspark.ml.classification import LogisticRegression\r\n>>> lr = LogisticRegression()\r\n>>> lr.hasParam(\"threshold\")\r\nTrue\r\n>>> lr.hasParam(u\"threshold\")\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n ...\r\n    raise TypeError(\"hasParam(): paramName must be a string\")\r\nTypeError: hasParam(): paramName must be a string\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/13036\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests in

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJIRA: [SPARK-19762](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19762)\r\n\r\nThe larger changes in this patch are:\r\n\r\n* Adds a `DifferentiableLossAggregator` trait which is intended to be used as a common parent trait to all Spark ML aggregator classes. It factors out the common methods: `merge, gradient, loss, weight` from the aggregator subclasses.\r\n* Adds a `RDDLossFunction` which is intended to be the only implementation of Breeze's `DiffFunction` necessary in Spark ML, and can be used by all other algorithms. It takes the aggregator type as a type parameter, and maps the aggregator over an RDD. It additionally takes in a optional regularization loss function for applying the differentiable part of regularization.\r\n* Factors out the regularization from the data part of the cost function, and treats regularization as a separate independent cost function which can be evaluated and added to the data cost function.\r\n* Changes `LinearRegression` to use this new hierarchy as a proof of concept.\r\n* Adds the following new namespaces `o.a.s.ml.optim.loss` and `o.a.s.ml.optim.aggregator`\r\n\r\nAlso note that none of these are public-facing changes. All of these classes are internal to Spark ML and remain that way.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: The large majority of the \"lines added\" and \"lines deleted\" are simply code moving around or unit tests.**\r\n\r\nBTW, I also converted LinearSVC to this framework as a way to prove that this new hierarchy is flexible enough for the other algorithms, but I backed those changes out because the PR is large enough as is. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nTest suites are added for the new components, and some test suites are also added to provide coverage where there wasn't any before.\r\n\r\n* DifferentiablLossAggregatorSuite\r\n* LeastSquaresAggregatorSuite\r\n* RDDLossFunctionSuite\r\n* DifferentiableRegularizationSuite\r\n\r\nBelow are some performance testing numbers. Run on a 6 node virtual cluster with 44 cores and ~110G RAM, the dataset size is about 37G. These are not \"large-scale\" tests, but we really want to just make sure the iteration times don't increase with this patch. Notably we are doing the regularization a bit differently than before, but that should cost very little. I think there's very little risk otherwise, and these numbers don't show a difference. Of course I'm happy to add more tests as we think it's necessary, but I think the patch is ready for review now.\r\n\r\n**Note:** timings are best of 3 runs. \r\n\r\n\r\n|    |   numFeatures |

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, when we detect fetch failure, we only remove the shuffle files produced by the executor, while the host itself might be down and all the shuffle files are not accessible. In case we are running multiple executors on a host, any host going down currently results in multiple fetch failures and multiple retries of the stage, which is very inefficient. If we remove all the shuffle files on that host, on first fetch failure, we can rerun all the tasks on that host in a single stage retry.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit testing and

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe evaluators BinaryClassificationEvaluator, RegressionEvaluator, and MulticlassClassificationEvaluator and the corresponding metrics classes

creating three pull requests, one for each of the evaluators (binary/regression/multiclass) to make it easier to review/update.\r\n\r\nNote: I've updated the JIRA

creating three pull requests, one for each of the evaluators (binary/regression/multiclass) to make it easier to review/update.\r\n\r\nThe updates to the regression metrics were based on (and updated with new changes based on comments):\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-11520\r\n (\"RegressionMetrics should support instance weights\")\r\n but the pull request was closed as the changes

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf spark ui port (4040) is not set, it will choose port number 0, this will make https port to also choose 0. And in Spark 2.1 code, it will use this https port (0) to do redirect, so when redirect triggered, it will point to a wrong url:\r\n\r\nlike:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/temp$ wget

Spark 2.1-, and can be reproduced in yarn cluster mode.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nCurrent redirect UT doesn't verify this issue, so extend current UT to do correct verification.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-27T10:48:12Z","updated_at":"2017-03-03T01:20:29Z","closed_at":"2017-03-03T01:20:29Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b9f8907d094a0c975eb48fffaa3fb2fcfd853884","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17083/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17083/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17083/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/9ee6a096504d91809c1cec7b7b0b525d54646300","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-19750","ref":"SPARK-19750","sha":"9ee6a096504d91809c1cec7b7b0b525d54646300","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIf we refresh a InMemoryFileIndex with a FileStatusCache, it will first use the FileStatusCache to re-generate the cachedLeafFiles etc, then call FileStatusCache.invalidateAll. \r\n\r\nWhile the order to do these two actions is wrong, this lead to the refresh action does not take effect.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  override def refresh(): Unit = {\r\n    refresh0()\r\n    fileStatusCache.invalidateAll()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private def refresh0(): Unit = {\r\n    val files = listLeafFiles(rootPaths)\r\n    cachedLeafFiles =\r\n      new mutable.LinkedHashMap[Path, FileStatus]() ++= files.map(f => f.getPath -> f)\r\n    cachedLeafDirToChildrenFiles = files.toArray.groupBy(_.getPath.getParent)\r\n    cachedPartitionSpec = null\r\n

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJIRA: [SPARK-19746](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19746)\r\n\r\nThe following code is inefficient:\r\n\r\n````scala\r\n    val localCoefficients: Vector = bcCoefficients.value\r\n\r\n    features.foreachActive { (index, value) =>\r\n      val stdValue = value / localFeaturesStd(index)\r\n      var j = 0\r\n      while (j < numClasses) {\r\n        margins(j) += localCoefficients(index * numClasses + j) * stdValue\r\n        j += 1\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\n`localCoefficients(index * numClasses + j)` calls `Vector.apply` which creates a new Breeze vector and indexes that. Even if it is not that slow to create the object, we will generate a lot of extra garbage that may result in longer GC pauses. This is a hot inner loop, so we should optimize wherever possible.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI don't think there's a great way to test this patch. It's purely performance related, so unit tests should guarantee that we haven't made any unwanted changes. Empirically I observed between 10-40% speedups just running short local tests. I suspect the big differences will be seen when large data/coefficient sizes have to pause for GC more often. I welcome other ideas for testing.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-27T05:27:47Z","updated_at":"2017-02-28T00:52:03Z","closed_at":"2017-02-28T00:37:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4abd8013cfb4a34ff4e472aa54498be40d6ef8c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17078/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17078/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17078/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/44ee1137efc5e23ffc6a5bfb8dec54d95e7a72e2","head":{"label":"sethah:logistic_agg_indexing","ref":"logistic_agg_indexing","sha":"44ee1137efc5e23ffc6a5bfb8dec54d95e7a72e2","user":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":38016887,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzODAxNjg4Nw==","name":"spark","full_name":"sethah/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sethah","id":7275795,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcyNzU3OTU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7275795?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah","html_url":"https://github.com/sethah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sethah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sethah/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nJIRA: [SPARK-19745](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19745)\r\n\r\nReorganize SVCAggregator to avoid serializing coefficients. This patch also makes the gradient array a `lazy val` which will avoid materializing a large array on the driver before shipping the class to the executors. This improvement stems from https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16037. Actually, probably all ML aggregators can benefit from this. \r\n\r\nWe can either: a.) separate the gradient improvement into another patch b.) keep what's here _plus_ add the lazy evaluation to all other aggregators in this patch or c.) keep it as is.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting question! I don't know of a reasonable way to test this right now. Ideally, we could perform an optimization and look at the shuffle write data for each task, and we could compare the size to what it we know it should be: `numCoefficients * 8 bytes`. Not sure if there is a good way to do that right now? We could discuss this here or in another JIRA, but I suspect it would be a significant undertaking.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBy default, a class loader will have java's system class loader as its parent, however this ExecutorClassLoader should always resolve classes from given 'paren't class loader.\r\n\r\nProblem happens when an application has a class loader structure like below\r\n\r\nSystem-Classloader [ClassA, Runtime]\r\n    |\r\nApplication-Classloader [ClassA, Spark, Jackson etc etc] : **parent**\r\n    |\r\nExecutor Class Loader\r\n\r\nThe application serializes ClassA using Application class loader however Spark deserializes the class using System Class loader, this leads to various problems.\r\n\r\nThe change here to pass null to the parent class so that a link between ExecutorClassLoader and SystemClassLoader no longer exists.\r\n\r\nFor most of situations, the parent class loader is the system class loader so this wouldn't have any impact.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch

Problem\r\n\r\nThere are several places where we write out version identifiers in various logs for structured streaming (usually `v1`). However, in the places where we check for this, we throw a confusing error message.\r\n\r\n## What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis patch made two major changes:\r\n1. added a `parseVersion(...)` method, and based on this method, fixed the following places the way they did version checking (no other place needed to do this checking):\r\n```\r\nHDFSMetadataLog\r\n  - CompactibleFileStreamLog  ------------> fixed with this patch\r\n    - FileStreamSourceLog  ---------------> inherited the fix of `CompactibleFileStreamLog`\r\n    - FileStreamSinkLog  -----------------> inherited the fix of `CompactibleFileStreamLog`\r\n  - OffsetSeqLog  ------------------------> fixed with this patch\r\n  - anonymous subclass in KafkaSource  ---> fixed with this patch\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. changed the type of `FileStreamSinkLog.VERSION`, `FileStreamSourceLog.VERSION` etc. from `String` to `Int`, so that we can identify newer versions via `version > 1` instead of `version != \"v1\"`\r\n    - note this didn't break any backwards compatibility -- we are still writing out `\"v1\"` and reading back `\"v1\"`\r\n\r\n## Exception message with this patch\r\n```\r\njava.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to read log file /private/var/folders/nn/82rmvkk568sd8p3p8tb33trw0000gn/T/spark-86867b65-0069-4ef1-b0eb-d8bd258ff5b8/0.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`Catalog.refreshByPath` can refresh the cache entry and the associated metadata for all dataframes (if any), that contain the given data source path.\r\n\r\nHowever, `CacheManager.invalidateCachedPath` doesn't clear all cached plans with the specified path. It causes some strange behaviors reported in SPARK-15678.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nJenkins tests.\r\n\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Timestamp hashing is done as per [TimestampWritable.hashCode()](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/ff67cdda1c538dc65087878eeba3e165cf3230f4/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/io/TimestampWritable.java#L406) in Hive\r\n- Interval hashing is done as per [HiveIntervalDayTime.hashCode()](https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/ff67cdda1c538dc65087878eeba3e165cf3230f4/storage-api/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/common/type/HiveIntervalDayTime.java#L178). Note that there are inherent differences in how Hive and Spark store intervals under the hood which limits the ability to be in completely sync with hive's hashing function. I have explained this in the method doc.\r\n- Date type was already supported. This PR adds test for that.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR is to make Spark work with Hive 2.0's metastores. Compared with Hive 1.2, Hive 2.0's metastore has an API update due to removal of `HOLD_DDLTIME` in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12224. Based on the following Hive JIRA description, `HOLD_DDLTIME` should be removed from our internal API too. (https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/17063 was submitted for it): \r\n> This arcane feature was introduced long ago via HIVE-1394 It was broken as soon as it landed, HIVE-1442 and is thus useless. Fact that no one has fixed it since informs that its not really used by anyone. Better is to remove it so no one hits the bug of HIVE-1442\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the next PR, we will support 2.1.0 metastore, whose APIs were changed due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-12730. However, before that, we need a code cleanup for stats collection and setting. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded test cases to

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAfter adding the tests for subquery, we now have multiple level of directories under \"sql-tests/inputs\".  Some times on Mac while using Finder application it creates the meta data files called \".DS_Store\". When these files are present at different levels in directory hierarchy, we get duplicate test exception while running the tests  as we just use the file name as the test case name. In this PR, we use the relative file path from the base directory along with the test file as the test name. Also after this change, we can have the same test file name under different directory like exists/basic.sql , in/basic.sql.

[PR](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/16938)\r\n\r\nThe following DDL for a managed table with an existed default location should throw an exception:\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE ... (PARTITIONED BY ...) AS SELECT ...\r\nCREATE TABLE ... (PARTITIONED BY ...)\r\n```\r\nCurrently there are some situations which are not consist with above logic:\r\n\r\n1. CREATE TABLE ... (PARTITIONED BY ...) succeed with an existed default location\r\nsituation: for both hive/datasource(with HiveExternalCatalog/InMemoryCatalog)\r\n\r\n2. CREATE TABLE ... (PARTITIONED BY ...) AS SELECT ...\r\nsituation: hive table succeed with an existed default location\r\n\r\nThis PR is going to make above two situations consist with the logic that it should throw an exception\r\nwith an

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up pr of #16308 and #16750.\r\n\r\nThis pr enables timezone support in partition values.\r\n\r\nWe should use `timeZone` option introduced at #16750 to parse/format partition values of the `TimestampType`.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have timestamp `\"2016-01-01 00:00:00\"` in `GMT` which will be used for partition values, the values written by the default timezone option, which is `\"GMT\"` because the session local timezone is `\"GMT\"` here, are:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.conf.set(\"spark.sql.session.timeZone\", \"GMT\")\r\n\r\nscala> val df = Seq((1, new java.sql.Timestamp(1451606400000L))).toDF(\"i\", \"ts\")\r\ndf: org.apache.spark.sql.DataFrame = [i: int, ts: timestamp]\r\n\r\nscala> df.show()\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  i|                 ts|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  1|2016-01-01 00:00:00|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n\r\nscala> df.write.partitionBy(\"ts\").save(\"/path/to/gmtpartition\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ls /path/to/gmtpartition/\r\n_SUCCESS\t\t\tts=2016-01-01 00%3A00%3A00\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas setting the option to `\"PST\"`, they are:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> df.write.option(\"timeZone\", \"PST\").partitionBy(\"ts\").save(\"/path/to/pstpartition\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ ls /path/to/pstpartition/\r\n_SUCCESS\t\t\tts=2015-12-31 16%3A00%3A00\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can properly read the partition values if the session local timezone and the timezone of the partition values are the same:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nscala> spark.read.load(\"/path/to/gmtpartition\").show()\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  i|                 ts|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  1|2016-01-01 00:00:00|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd even if the timezones are different, we can properly read the values with setting corrent timezone option:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// wrong result\r\nscala> spark.read.load(\"/path/to/pstpartition\").show()\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  i|                 ts|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  1|2015-12-31 16:00:00|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n\r\n// correct result\r\nscala> spark.read.option(\"timeZone\", \"PST\").load(\"/path/to/pstpartition\").show()\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  i|                 ts|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n|  1|2016-01-01 00:00:00|\r\n+---+-------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests and added some tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-02-24T06:47:30Z","updated_at":"2017-03-04T00:38:13Z","closed_at":"2017-03-04T00:38:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"69fb3d682bcb2ffa38f507c648074356915af220","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17053/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17053/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17053/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f7a146ad835f25db27eeae6bad2315a91f43df31","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-18939","ref":"issues/SPARK-18939","sha":"f7a146ad835f25db27eeae6bad2315a91f43df31","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nIn the PR https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/11403, we introduced the function `canonicalized` for eliminating useless subqueries. We can simply replace the call of rule `EliminateSubqueryAliases` by the function `canonicalized`. \r\n\r\nAfter we changed the view resolution and management, the current reason why we keep `EliminateSubqueryAliases ` in optimizer becomes out-of-dated. Thus, this PR also update the reason to `eager analysis of Dataset`. \r\n\r\n### How was this patch

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis change redacts senstive information (based on `spark.redaction.regex` property)\r\nfrom the Spark Submit console logs.

I considered it out of the scope of this JIRA to write an integration test to make sure new leaks don't happen in the future.\r\n\r\nRunning unit tests to make sure nothing else is broken by this

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n[SPARK-19617](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19617) changed `HDFSMetadataLog` to enable interrupts when using the local file system. However, now we hit [HADOOP-12074](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12074): `Shell.runCommand` converts `InterruptedException` to `new IOException(ie.toString())` before Hadoop 2.8.

If so, treat it as `InterruptedException`. This is for pre-Hadoop 2.8.\r\n- Treat `InterruptedIOException` as `InterruptedException`. This is for Hadoop 2.8+ and other places that may throw `InterruptedIOException` when the thread is interrupted.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThe new unit

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdd a new Kafka Sink and Kafka Relation for writing streaming and batch queries, respectively, to Apache Kafka. \r\n### Streaming Kafka Sink\r\n- When addBatch is called\r\n-- If batchId is great than the last written batch\r\n--- Write batch to Kafka\r\n---- Topic will be taken from the record, if present, or from a topic option, which overrides topic in record.\r\n-- Else ignore\r\n\r\n### Batch Kafka Sink\r\n- KafkaSourceProvider will implement CreatableRelationProvider\r\n- CreatableRelationProvider#createRelation will write the passed in Dataframe to a Kafka\r\n- Topic will be taken from the record, if present, or from topic option, which overrides topic in record.\r\n- Save modes Append and ErrorIfExist supported under identical semantics. Other save modes result in an AnalysisException\r\n\r\n\r\n@tdas @zsxwing \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n### The following unit tests will be included\r\n- write to stream with topic field: valid stream write with data that includes an existing topic in the schema\r\n- write structured streaming aggregation w/o topic field, with default topic: valid stream write with data that does not include a topic field, but the configuration includes a default topic\r\n- write data with bad schema: various cases of writing data that does not conform to a proper schema e.g., 1. no topic field or default topic, and 2. no value field\r\n- write data with valid schema but wrong types: data with a complete schema but wrong types e.g., key and value types are integers. \r\n- write to non-existing topic: write a stream to a topic that does not exist in Kafka, which has been configured to not auto-create topics. \r\n- write batch to kafka: simple write batch to Kafka, which goes through the same code path as streaming scenario, so validity checks will not be redone here.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n```scala\r\n// Structured Streaming\r\nval writer = inputStringStream.map(s => s.get(0).toString.getBytes()).toDF(\"value\")\r\n .selectExpr(\"value as key\", \"value as value\")\r\n .writeStream\r\n .format(\"kafka\")\r\n .option(\"checkpointLocation\", checkpointDir)\r\n .outputMode(OutputMode.Append)\r\n .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\", brokerAddress)\r\n .option(\"topic\", topic)\r\n .queryName(\"kafkaStream\")\r\n .start()\r\n\r\n// Batch \r\nval df = spark\r\n .sparkContext\r\n .parallelize(Seq(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\"))\r\n .map(v => (topic, v))\r\n .toDF(\"topic\", \"value\")\r\n\r\ndf.write\r\n .format(\"kafka\")\r\n .option(\"kafka.bootstrap.servers\",brokerAddress)\r\n .option(\"topic\", topic)\r\n .save()\r\n```\r\nPlease review http://spark.apache.org/contributing.html before opening a pull

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n`CatalogTableType` seems to implement an union data type enumerating all possible catalog table types. \r\n\r\nIt is built using a case class with a single value attribute \"name\". Wisely, it seems to be intended to be set only by the case class private constructor within the companion object with the idea of users not being able to create `CatalogTableType` instances but using those enumerated within that object.\r\n\r\nHowever, making the case class constructor private does't forbid users creating whichever instances they want to create since the case class factory is still public. e.g:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala> case class C private(x: Int)\r\ndefined class C\r\n\r\nscala> C(1)\r\nres0: C = C(1) // Should users be able to do this?\r\n\r\nscala> new C(1) //This is the expected behaviour.\r\n<console>:13: error: constructor C in class C cannot be accessed in object $iw\r\n       new C(1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `CatalogTableType` a regular class, if matching the name was necessary, its companion object could implement `unapply`. Alternatives ways of solving this could be just using Scala's enumeration or model `CatalogTableType` using algebraic data types based on extending an interface, e.g:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrait CatalogTableType { val name: String } \r\n\r\nobject CatalogTableType {\r\n  object EXTERNAL extends CatalogTableType { val name = \"EXTERNAL\" }\r\n  object INTERNAL extends CatalogTableType { val name = \"INTERNAL\" }\r\n  object VIEW     extends CatalogTableType { val name = \"VIEW\" }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nThis PR does not add new functionality and has thus been tested by your current test suite.","created_at":"2017-02-23T13:41:53Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T15:46:37Z","closed_at":"2017-04-24T15:46:37Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e0531936b35bb93f7e1f02c71be00f6402ca9212","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17040/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17040/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17040/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/daae901d331293144af8dd125ea59892f5ec3c3d","head":{"label":"pfcoperez:catalogtabletpe_private_factory","ref":"catalogtabletpe_private_factory","sha":"daae901d331293144af8dd125ea59892f5ec3c3d","user":{"login":"pfcoperez","id":273379,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI3MzM3OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/273379?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez","html_url":"https://github.com/pfcoperez","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pfcoperez/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"769aa0f1d22d3c6d4c7871468344d82c8dc36260","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17165658,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzE2NTY1OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"apache/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently in Spark there're two issues when we add jars with invalid path:\r\n\r\n* If the jar path is a empty string {--jar \",dummy.jar\"}, then Spark will resolve it to the current directory path and add to classpath / file server, which is unwanted. This is happened in our programatic way to submit Spark application. From my understanding Spark should defensively filter out such empty path.\r\n* If the jar path is a invalid path (file doesn't exist), `addJar` doesn't check it and will still add to file server, the exception will be delayed until job running. Actually this local path could be checked beforehand, no need to wait until task running. We have similar check in `addFile`, but lacks similar similar mechanism in `addJar`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdd unit test and local manual verification.","created_at":"2017-02-23T09:31:48Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T17:31:28Z","closed_at":"2017-02-24T17:31:28Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6d2515b5cf900be889aa622c8e6aae1bb059ed4c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17038/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17038/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17038/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/db5c287e1223522de9c17391c3ea3025c938158e","head":{"label":"jerryshao:SPARK-19707","ref":"SPARK-19707","sha":"db5c287e1223522de9c17391c3ea3025c938158e","user":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18259371,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODI1OTM3MQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"jerryshao/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jerryshao","id":850797,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDc5Nw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/850797?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao","html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jerryshao/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jerryshao/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark executes SQL commands eagerly. It does this by creating an RDD which contains the command's results. The downside to this is that any action on this RDD triggers a Spark job which is expensive and is unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this by avoiding the materialization of an `RDD` for `Command`s; it just materializes the result and puts them in a `LocalRelation`.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a regression test to `SQLQuerySuite`.","created_at":"2017-02-22T14:06:10Z","updated_at":"2017-02-25T07:08:17Z","closed_at":"2017-02-25T07:08:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"996ba939b576a1586c9cfedf858a2d4140cc9807","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17027/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/17027/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/17027/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/dad6b13c3940133743f0821f80da1bffc7327b67","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:no-job-command","ref":"no-job-command","sha":"dad6b13c3940133743f0821f80da1bffc7327b67","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror
