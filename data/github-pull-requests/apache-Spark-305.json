What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSpark native read path allows tuning the partition size based on spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes and spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes. It would be useful to add a similar functionality/behavior to HadoopRDD, i.e, pack multiple input splits into a single partition based on maxPartitionBytes and openCostInBytes. We have had several use-cases to merge small files by coalescing them by size to reduce the number of tasks launched.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test. It was also tested manually in a few production jobs.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe HTTP Strict-Transport-Security response header (often abbreviated as HSTS) is a security feature that lets a web site tell browsers that it should only be communicated with using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.\r\n\r\nNote: The Strict-Transport-Security header is ignored by the browser when your site is accessed using HTTP; this is because an attacker may intercept HTTP connections and inject the header or remove it. When your site is accessed over HTTPS with no certificate errors, the browser knows your site is HTTPS capable and will honor the Strict-Transport-Security header.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP X-XSS-Protection response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\r\n\r\nThe HTTP X-Content-Type-Options response header is used to protect against MIME sniffing vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nChecked on my system locally.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"750\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-10-03

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nCurrently, the group state of user-defined-type is encoded as top-level columns in the UnsafeRows stores in the state store. The timeout timestamp is also saved as (when needed) as the last top-level column. Since the group state is serialized to top-level columns, you cannot save \"null\" as a value of state (setting null in all the top-level columns is not equivalent). So we don't let the user set the timeout without initializing the state for a key. Based on user experience, this leads to confusion.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to change the row format such that the state is saved as nested columns. This would allow the state to be set to null, and avoid these confusing corner cases.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nRefactored tests.","created_at":"2017-10-03T02:57:10Z","updated_at":"2017-10-05T02:27:52Z","closed_at":"2017-10-05T02:27:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"290763aa78888a3fdd70e4974baa5767f6f4008e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/ee0b81a148c892e0f27191c31dbef1c42424b6e1","head":{"label":"tdas:SPARK-22187","ref":"SPARK-22187","sha":"ee0b81a148c892e0f27191c31dbef1c42424b6e1","user":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17603343,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzYwMzM0Mw==","name":"spark","full_name":"tdas/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"tdas","id":663212,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY2MzIxMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/663212?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas","html_url":"https://github.com/tdas","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdas/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/tdas/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix for SPARK-20466, full description of the issue in the JIRA. To summarize, `HadoopRDD` uses a metadata cache to cache `JobConf` objects. The cache uses soft-references, which means the JVM can delete entries from the cache whenever there is GC pressure. `HadoopRDD#getJobConf` had a bug where it would check if the cache contained the `JobConf`, if it did it would get the `JobConf` from the cache and return it. This doesn't work when soft-references are used as the JVM can delete the entry between the existence check and the get call.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nHaven't thought of a good way to test this yet given the issue only occurs sometimes, and happens during high GC pressure. Was thinking of using mocks to verify `#getJobConf` is doing the right thing. I deleted the method `HadoopRDD#containsCachedMetadata` so that we don't hit this issue again.","created_at":"2017-10-02T21:03:55Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T23:56:17Z","closed_at":"2017-10-03T23:56:17Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"94f00e2c52ceb69f3b1cc5779abe4bb1de0244d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19413/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19413/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19413/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/079a4e26ec900745411fdd60e4cd242b9a43320b","head":{"label":"sahilTakiar:master","ref":"master","sha":"079a4e26ec900745411fdd60e4cd242b9a43320b","user":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":86848625,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4Njg0ODYyNQ==","name":"spark","full_name":"sahilTakiar/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sahilTakiar","id":1282583,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyODI1ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1282583?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar","html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sahilTakiar/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sahilTakiar/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nMove flume behind a profile, take 2. See https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/19365 for most of the back-story.\r\n\r\nThis change should fix the problem by removing the examples module dependency and moving Flume examples to the module itself. It also adds deprecation messages, per a discussion on dev@ about deprecating for 2.3.0.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests, which still enable flume

GraphX jobs, when checkpoints are enabled, GraphX can fail with `FileNotFoundException`.\r\n\r\nThe failure can happen during Pregel iterations or when Pregel completes only in cases of insufficient memory when checkpointed RDDs are evicted from memory and have to be read from disk (but already removed from there).\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to preserve all the checkpoints the last one (checkpoint) of `messages` and `graph` depends on during the iterations, and all the checkpoints of `messages` and `graph` the resulting `graph` depends at the end of Pregel iterations.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests as well as manually in production jobs which previously were failing until this PR

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe definition of `maxRows` in `LocalLimit` operator was simply wrong. This patch introduces a new `maxRowsPerPartition` method and uses that in pruning. The patch also adds more documentation on why we need local limit vs global limit.\r\n\r\nNote that this previously has never been a bug because the way the code is structured, but future use of the maxRows could lead to bugs.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nShould be covered by existing test cases.\r\n\r\nCloses #18851

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nBy definition the table name in Spark can be something like `123x`, `25a`, etc., with exceptions for literals like `12L`, `23BD`, etc. However, Spark SQL has a special byte length literal, which stops users to use digits followed by `b`, `k`, `m`, `g` as identifiers.\r\n\r\nbyte length literal is not a standard sql literal and is only used in the `tableSample` parser rule. This PR move the parsing of byte length literal from lexer to parser, so that users can use it as identifiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nregression

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Solves the issue described in the ticket by preserving reservation and allocation info in all cases (port handling included).\r\n- upgrades to 1.4\r\n- Adds extra debug level logging to make debugging easier in the future, for example we add reservation info when applicable.\r\n```\r\n 17/09/29 14:53:07 DEBUG MesosCoarseGrainedSchedulerBackend: Accepting offer: f20de49b-dee3-45dd-a3c1-73418b7de891-O32 with attributes: Map() allocation info: role: \"spark-prive\"\r\n  reservation info: name: \"ports\"\r\n

Specifically I tested it on a dc/os 1.10 cluster with 7 nodes and played with reservations. From the master node in order to reserve resources I executed:\r\n\r\n```for i in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\r\ndo\r\ncurl -i \\\r\n      -d slaveId=90ec65ea-1f7b-479f-a824-35d2527d6d26-S$i \\\r\n      -d

\"reservation\": {\r\n            \"principal\": \"\"\r\n          }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"name\": \"mem\",\r\n          \"type\": \"SCALAR\",\r\n          \"scalar\": { \"value\": 8026 },\r\n          \"role\": \"spark-role\",\r\n          \"reservation\": {\r\n            \"principal\": \"\"\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]' \\\r\n      -X POST http://master.mesos:5050/master/reserve\r\ndone\r\n```\r\nNodes had 4 cpus (m3.xlarge instances)  and I reserved either 2 or 4 cpus (all for a role).\r\nI verified it launches tasks on nodes with

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to add a rule that re-uses `TypeCoercion.findWiderCommonType` when resolving type conflicts in partition

have modified SparkHadoopWriter so that executors and the driver always use consistent JobIds during the hadoop commit. Before SPARK-18191, spark always used the rddId, it just incorrectly named the variable stageId. After SPARK-18191, it used the rddId in the driver, and the stageId in the executors. With this change, spark uses a closure to create configs that will be called as soon as stageId is available in DAGScheduler. This way executors and the river will consistently uses stageId.\r\n In addition to the existing unit tests, a test has been added to check whether executors and the driver are using the same JobId.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSpark's RangePartitioner hard codes the number of sampling points per partition to be 20. This is sometimes too low. This ticket makes it configurable, via spark.sql.execution.rangeExchange.sampleSizePerPartition, and raises the default in Spark SQL to be 100.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a pretty sophisticated test based on chi square test

initial listener code is based on the existing JobProgressListener (and others),\r\nand tries to mimic their behavior as much as possible. The change also includes\r\nsome minor code movement so that some types and methods from the initial history\r\nserver code code can be reused.\r\n\r\nThe code introduces a few mutable versions of public API types, used internally,\r\nto make it easier to update information without ugly copy methods, and also to\r\nmake certain updates cheaper.\r\n\r\nNote the code here is not 100% correct. This is meant as a building ground for\r\nthe UI integration in the next milestones. As different parts of the UI are\r\nported, fixes will be made to the different parts of this code to account\r\nfor the needed behavior.\r\n\r\nI also added annotations to API types so that Jackson is able to correctly\r\ndeserialize options, sequences and maps that store primitive types.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-28T17:54:11Z","updated_at":"2017-10-30T16:57:48Z","closed_at":"2017-10-26T16:09:21Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"164046e12bd595710e113cf94e1ee7ffb8a32964","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/53357a1bcca24149d258f6c1118ee2166a8389bb","head":{"label":"vanzin:SPARK-20643","ref":"SPARK-20643","sha":"53357a1bcca24149d258f6c1118ee2166a8389bb","user":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":18302272,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxODMwMjI3Mg==","name":"spark","full_name":"vanzin/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"vanzin","id":1694083,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE2OTQwODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1694083?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin","html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vanzin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/vanzin/spark","description":"Mirror

its child column vectors. This can create memory leaks for `OffHeapColumnVector` where we do not clean up the memory allocated by a vectors children. This can be especially bad for string columns (which uses a child byte column vector).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have updated the existing tests to always use both on-heap and off-heap vectors. Testing and diagnosis was done locally.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-28T08:49:18Z","updated_at":"2017-09-28T15:53:30Z","closed_at":"2017-09-28T15:53:30Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d8500917b960a524a24a356d54783d70385c4a15","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19378/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19378/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19378/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/a82c494e55c0d57875625c5cf72a9ca39bd608b8","head":{"label":"hvanhovell:SPARK-22143-2.2","ref":"SPARK-22143-2.2","sha":"a82c494e55c0d57875625c5cf72a9ca39bd608b8","user":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":35900688,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzNTkwMDY4OA==","name":"spark","full_name":"hvanhovell/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hvanhovell","id":9616802,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjk2MTY4MDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9616802?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell","html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hvanhovell/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hvanhovell/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n- Fixes the issue with the frameworkId being recovered by checkpointed data overwriting the one sent by the dipatcher.\r\n- Keeps submission driver id as the only index for all data structures in the dispatcher. \r\nAllocates a different task id per driver retry to satisfy the mesos requirements. Check the relevant ticket for the details on that.\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested this with DC/OS 1.10. Launched a streaming job with checkpointing to hdfs, made the driver fail several times and observed behavior:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/30940500-f7d2a744-a3e9-11e7-8c56-f2ccbb271e80.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/30940550-19bc15de-a3ea-11e7-8a11-f48abfe36720.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/30940524-083ea308-a3ea-11e7-83ae-00d3fa17b928.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/30940579-2f0fb242-a3ea-11e7-82f9-86179da28b8c.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/30940591-3b561b0e-a3ea-11e7-9dbd-e71912bb2ef3.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/30940605-49c810ca-a3ea-11e7-8af5-67930851fd38.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/30940631-59f4a288-a3ea-11e7-88cb-c3741b72bb13.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/30940642-62346c9e-a3ea-11e7-8935-82e494925f67.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7945591/30940653-6c46d53c-a3ea-11e7-8dd1-5840d484d28c.png)\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-27T22:14:55Z","updated_at":"2017-11-02T13:28:27Z","closed_at":"2017-11-02T13:28:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e818c125f530b84979877a903317aa1cd551f7c7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19374/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19374/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19374/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/06999177331b7323813eca3c06d6a9a55e054f7d","head":{"label":"skonto:fix_retry","ref":"fix_retry","sha":"06999177331b7323813eca3c06d6a9a55e054f7d","user":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":48892104,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0ODg5MjEwNA==","name":"spark","full_name":"skonto/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"skonto","id":7945591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDU1OTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7945591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto","html_url":"https://github.com/skonto","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/skonto/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/skonto/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix for [SPARK-22150](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-22150) JIRA issue.\r\n\r\nIn case of checkpointing RDDs which depend on previously checkpointed RDDs (for example in iterative algorithms) PeriodicCheckpointer removes already checkpointed materialized RDDs too early leading to FileNotFoundExceptions.\r\n\r\nConsider the following snippet\r\n\r\n    // create a periodic checkpointer with interval of 2\r\n    val checkpointer = new PeriodicRDDCheckpointer[Double](2, sc)\r\n    \r\n    val rdd1 = createRDD(sc)\r\n    checkpointer.update(rdd1)\r\n    // on the second update rdd1 is checkpointed\r\n    checkpointer.update(rdd1)\r\n    // on action checkpointed rdd is materialized and its lineage is truncated\r\n    rdd1.count() \r\n    \r\n    // rdd2 depends on rdd1\r\n    val rdd2 = rdd1.filter(_ => true)\r\n    checkpointer.update(rdd2)\r\n    // on the second update rdd2 is checkpointed and checkpoint files of rdd1 are deleted\r\n    checkpointer.update(rdd2)\r\n    // on action it's necessary to read already removed checkpoint files of rdd1\r\n    rdd2.count()\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to preserve all the checkpoints the last one depends on to be able to evaluate the final RDD even if the last checkpoint (the final RDD depends on) is not yet materialized.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnit tests as well as manually in production jobs which previously were failing until this PR applied.","created_at":"2017-09-27T21:54:57Z","updated_at":"2020-01-16T00:08:23Z","closed_at":"2020-01-16T00:08:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bd61a9263c6f8f5cacf94ba75d1ebefba71c818a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405801482,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAxNDgy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SPARK%20CORE","name":"SPARK

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixing the way how `SPARK_HOME` is resolved on Windows. While the previous version was working with the built release download, the set of directories changed slightly for the PySpark `pip` or `conda` install. This has been reflected in Linux files in `bin` but not for Windows `cmd` files. \r\n\r\nFirst fix improves the way how the `jars` directory is found, as this was stoping Windows version of `pip/conda` install from working; JARs were not found by on Session/Context setup.\r\n\r\nSecond fix is adding `find-spark-home.cmd` script, which uses `find_spark_home.py` script, as the Linux version, to resolve `SPARK_HOME`. It is based on `find-spark-home` bash script, though, some operations are done in different order due to the `cmd` script language limitations. If environment variable is set, the Python script `find_spark_home.py` will not be run. The process can fail if Python is not installed, but it will mostly use this way if PySpark is installed via `pip/conda`, thus, there is some Python in the system. \r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nTested on local installation.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-27T16:44:20Z","updated_at":"2017-11-23T04:45:09Z","closed_at":"2017-11-23T03:50:32Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"961e1a49be64637512fb1c9ef40444ae36c43380","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19370/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19370/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19370/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/b58f74054f9c02b0548254984dfe46516fe14e18","head":{"label":"jsnowacki:fix_spark_cmds","ref":"fix_spark_cmds","sha":"b58f74054f9c02b0548254984dfe46516fe14e18","user":{"login":"jsnowacki","id":1014323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQzMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1014323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki","html_url":"https://github.com/jsnowacki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":100690495,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDA2OTA0OTU=","name":"spark-1","full_name":"jsnowacki/spark-1","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jsnowacki","id":1014323,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMTQzMjM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1014323?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki","html_url":"https://github.com/jsnowacki","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsnowacki/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jsnowacki/spark-1","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nPrior to this commit BlockId.hashCode and BlockId.equals were defined\r\nin terms of BlockId.name. This allowed the subclasses to be concise and\r\nenforced BlockId.name as a single unique identifier for a block. All\r\nsubclasses override BlockId.name with an expression involving an\r\nallocation of StringBuilder and ultimatelly String. This is suboptimal\r\nsince it induced unnecessary GC pressure on the dirver, see\r\nBlockManagerMasterEndpoint.\r\n\r\nThe commit removes the definition of hashCode and equals from the base\r\nclass. No other change is necessary since all subclasses are in fact\r\ncase classes and therefore have auto-generated hashCode and equals. No\r\nchange of behaviour is expected.\r\n\r\nSidenote: you might be wondering, why did the subclasses use the base\r\nimplementation and the auto-generated one? Apparently, this behaviour\r\nis documented in the spec. See this SO answer for details\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/44990210/262432.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nBlockIdSuite","created_at":"2017-09-27T16:34:52Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T15:06:36Z","closed_at":"2017-10-08T12:01:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4e429dffb5f06c1f00da2207ebf08944610ef713","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19369/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19369/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19369/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/d996c283602269afd05dffad1e681f47f7baf47f","head":{"label":"criteo-forks:blockid-equals-hashcode","ref":"blockid-equals-hashcode","sha":"d996c283602269afd05dffad1e681f47f7baf47f","user":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":63715517,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MzcxNTUxNw==","name":"spark","full_name":"criteo-forks/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"criteo-forks","id":9960514,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjk5NjA1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9960514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks","html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/criteo-forks/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/criteo-forks/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`WriteableColumnVector` does not close its child column vectors. This can create memory leaks for `OffHeapColumnVector` where we do not clean up the memory allocated by a vectors children. This can be especially bad for string columns (which uses a child byte column vector).\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nI have updated the existing tests to always use both on-heap and off-heap vectors.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThe Master register application function requires an alarm log to increase the waiting status.\r\n\r\nWhen I create a spark application, I apply for the resources to reach the ceiling, the current Worker does not have enough resources to allocate Executor, this time spark application state is waiting.\r\nBut I can not know from the spark master log this situation, which led to my positioning problems difficult, I mistakenly thought that the master or worker process dead.\r\n\r\nAll that I added to the warting state of the warn log, which better helps us locate this kind of problem.\r\n\r\n1.WAITING  app:\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26266482/30858530-a3f3c5e2-a2f2-11e7-9899-041cf3eac118.png)\r\n\r\n2.master

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSince the current code ignores WITH clauses to check input relations in TPCDS queries, this leads to inaccurate per-row processing time for benchmark results. For example, in `q2`, this fix could catch all the input relations: `web_sales`, `date_dim`, and `catalog_sales` (the current code catches `date_dim` only). The one-third of the TPCDS queries uses WITH clauses, so I think it is worth fixing this.\r\n\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\nManually

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove `assume` in `Utils.resolveURIs` and replace `assume` to `assert` in `Utils.resolveURI` in the test cases in `UtilsSuite`.\r\n\r\nIt looks `Utils.resolveURIs` supports multiple but also single paths as input. So, it looks not meaningful to check if the input has `,`.\r\n\r\nFor the test for `Utils.resolveURI`, I replaced it to `assert` because it looks taking single path and in order to prevent future mistakes when adding more tests here. \r\n\r\nFor `assume` in `HiveDDLSuite`, it looks it should be `assert` to test at the last\r\n## How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nFixed unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2017-09-23T10:56:15Z","updated_at":"2018-01-02T03:41:26Z","closed_at":"2017-09-24T08:14:22Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"759f14742f53ebc6d5ce9bd44f92923195eadd04","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19332/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/19332/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/19332/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/c32f65b4a25c53e3fbf3ca5dff274f762da37d5b","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:SPARK-22093","ref":"SPARK-22093","sha":"c32f65b4a25c53e3fbf3ca5dff274f762da37d5b","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to enhance the documentation for `trim` functions in the function description session.\r\n\r\n- Add more `usage`, `arguments` and `examples` for the trim function\r\n- Adjust space in the `usage` session\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, the trim function documentation will look like this:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- `trim`\r\n\r\n```trim(str) - Removes the leading and trailing space characters from str.\r\n\r\ntrim(BOTH trimStr FROM str) - Remove the leading and trailing trimStr characters from str\r\n\r\ntrim(LEADING trimStr FROM str) - Remove the leading trimStr characters from str\r\n\r\ntrim(TRAILING trimStr FROM str) - Remove the trailing trimStr characters from str\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n\r\nstr - a string expression\r\ntrimStr - the trim string characters to trim, the default value is a single space\r\nBOTH, FROM - these are keywords to specify trimming string characters from both ends of the string\r\nLEADING, FROM - these are keywords to specify trimming string characters from the left end of the string\r\nTRAILING, FROM - these are keywords to specify trimming string characters from the right end of the string\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n> SELECT trim('    SparkSQL   ');\r\n SparkSQL\r\n> SELECT trim('SL', 'SSparkSQLS');\r\n parkSQ\r\n> SELECT trim(BOTH 'SL' FROM 'SSparkSQLS');\r\n parkSQ\r\n> SELECT trim(LEADING 'SL' FROM 'SSparkSQLS');\r\n parkSQLS\r\n> SELECT trim(TRAILING 'SL' FROM 'SSparkSQLS');\r\n SSparkSQ\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `ltrim`\r\n\r\n```ltrim\r\n\r\nltrim(str) - Removes the leading space characters from str.\r\n\r\nltrim(trimStr, str) - Removes the leading string contains the characters from the trim

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to enhance the documentation for `trim` functions in the function description session.\r\n\r\n- Add more `usage`, `arguments` and `examples` for the trim function\r\n- Adjust space in the `usage` session\r\n\r\nAfter the changes, the trim function documentation will look like this:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n- `trim`\r\n\r\n```trim(str) - Removes the leading and trailing space characters from str.\r\n\r\ntrim(BOTH trimStr FROM str) - Remove the leading and trailing trimStr characters from str\r\n\r\ntrim(LEADING trimStr FROM str) - Remove the leading trimStr characters from str\r\n\r\ntrim(TRAILING trimStr FROM str) - Remove the trailing trimStr characters from str\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n\r\nstr - a string expression\r\ntrimStr - the trim string characters to trim, the default value is a single space\r\nBOTH, FROM - these are keywords to specify trimming string characters from both ends of the string\r\nLEADING, FROM - these are keywords to specify trimming string characters from the left end of the string\r\nTRAILING, FROM - these are keywords to specify trimming string characters from the right end of the string\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n> SELECT trim('    SparkSQL   ');\r\n SparkSQL\r\n> SELECT trim('SL', 'SSparkSQLS');\r\n parkSQ\r\n> SELECT trim(BOTH 'SL' FROM 'SSparkSQLS');\r\n parkSQ\r\n> SELECT trim(LEADING 'SL' FROM 'SSparkSQLS');\r\n parkSQLS\r\n> SELECT trim(TRAILING 'SL' FROM 'SSparkSQLS');\r\n SSparkSQ\r\n```\r\n\r\n- `ltrim`\r\n\r\n```ltrim\r\n\r\nltrim(str) - Removes the leading space characters from str.\r\n\r\nltrim(trimStr, str) - Removes the leading string contains the characters from the trim
