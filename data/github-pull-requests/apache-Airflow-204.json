change introduces improvements in the way logs are displayed\r\nin CI jobs and in amount of logs produced in general for CI jobs\r\ndue to much smarter cache usage.\r\n\r\nLogs in all CI jobs are now grouped in groups which are folded\r\nby default when there is no error generated in such group. Similar\r\nsolution has been already used in docs job and it improved\r\nboth readability and speed of loading of the logs in CI after\r\nrecent improvements in Github UI (previously the speed of loading\r\nthe logs was not improved by groups).\r\n\r\nAlso cache usage has been reviewed and fixed in a number of places\r\nwhich will result in much shorted setup times for static checks\r\nand kubernetes virtualenv but also far shorter logs generated by\r\ncache setup (we are using restore-keys feature that implements\r\nincremental approach for cache building even if cache keys in\r\nGitHub Actions are immutable.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

review only the last commit (this one is base on an earlier LDAP change) #13308\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a complete refactor of the setup.py providers/dependencies.\r\n\r\nIt much better reflects the current setup where we have most of\r\nthe extras 1-1 reflecting providers but also some extras that do\r\nnot have their own providers.\r\n\r\nThe pre-commits that were verifying setup versus documentation\r\ncan now be vastly simplified (no more need to parse the\r\ncomments so we can import setup.py variables directly rather\r\nthan parse it via regexps. Also we can better categorize the\r\nextras - separate out (and verify) whether we correctly\r\ndescribed deprecated extras and to mark extras that install\r\nadditional providers as such.\r\n\r\nFixes: #13309\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

personally (as probably most of the developers in this project) do not deal with the development of Javascript code, but `entrypoint_ci.sh` forces us to recompile resources even when we don't need it. This takes a lot of time and is frustrating. This can happen very often as even a small change forces you to recompile assets.  This is especially problematic when working with two branches that have two different versions of JS files. Then, each restart of the environment means that we have to wait until the files are regenerated.\r\n\r\nSince most developers don't need to keep these files in good shape, I didn't decide to add an additional question, but did give a warning with yellow text.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I fixed one problem. When we run the environment with the use of a pre-baked image, e.g. on CI, or when using the \"--github-image-id\" option, we do not want to recompile assets. Unfortunately, the finished images did not contain checksums, because `Dockerfile` files run `compile_assets.sh` scripts, which did not generate checksums. I moved the checksum generation to the compile_assets.sh file, so now the pre-baked image will have checksums and won't regenerate assets.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nThank you for contributing!

is currently broken.\r\n\r\nThis PR gets it working again.\r\n\r\n# Issues resolved\r\n\r\n## 1. missing job id\r\n\r\nBefore SchedulerJob starts executor it sets `self.executor.job_id = self.id`, where self.id is the primary key in the jobs table.\r\n\r\nSee here: https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/master/airflow/jobs/scheduler_job.py#L1265.\r\n\r\nSo with KubernetesExecutor, when `start` is called, the executor has a value under `job_id`.\r\n\r\nBut with CeleryKubernetesExecutor enabled, the actual executors are under attributes on the CKE object, so they don't have the job ID, so when K8s executor tries to start, it fails because it doesn't find a job id.\r\n\r\n### Resolution:\r\n\r\nI add a setter for job_id, so that when you set job_id on the CKE, it immediately propagates the value to the child executors. \r\n\r\n## 2. missing slots_available\r\n\r\nSince this executor does not inherit BaseExecutor, this property is missing and we must add it.\r\n\r\n### Resolution:\r\n\r\nAnd I add slots_available property.\r\n\r\n## 3. Celery worker does not run properly with CeleryKubernetesExecutor\r\n\r\nWhen `airflow celery worker` is run with `executor=CeleryKubernetesExecutor`, celery worker fails to fork properly.\r\n\r\nSee more details in issue #13263.\r\n\r\n### Resolution:\r\n* Update helm chart so that flower and celery use CeleryExecutor while scheduler etc uses CeleryKubernetesExecutor\r\n* Update docs to highlight that celery workers must always be configured to use CeleryExecutor.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps a bit of a hack, but it provides a workable way to use this executor.\r\n","created_at":"2020-12-22T09:27:56Z","updated_at":"2021-05-18T20:43:26Z","closed_at":"2021-02-03T17:38:23Z","merged_at":"2021-02-03T17:38:23Z","merge_commit_sha":"b59e416f61edce86a811ec251d5887bfa728376f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1545560198,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTQ1NTYwMTk4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/airflow/labels/area:Scheduler","name":"area:Scheduler","color":"6a3aaa","default":false,"description":"including

uses a [multiprocessing.Queue](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#multiprocessing.Queue) to distribute tasks to the instances of `QueuedLocalWorker`. If for some reason LocalExecutor exits (e.g. because it encountered an unhandled exception), then each of the QueuedLocalWorker instances that it manages will also exit with an uncaught `EOFError` while trying to read from the task queue.\r\n\r\nBecause this causes a traceback to be logged for each of the workers that exits, this obfuscates the root cause of the issue, i.e. that the managing `LocalExecutor` terminated. By catching the `EOFError` in QueuedLocalWorker, logging an error and exiting gracefully we circumvent this problem, providing more clarity to the root cause of the issue to the Airflow administrator.\r\n\r\n---\r\n**^ Add meaningful description above**\r\n\r\nRead the **[Pull Request
