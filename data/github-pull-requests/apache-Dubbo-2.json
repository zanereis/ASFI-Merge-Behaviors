What is the purpose of the change?\r\n\r\n- Refactored method `generateExtNameAssignment` in `AdaptiveClassCodeGenerator` that was TODO commented.\r\n- Previously, this had the disadvantage of poor visibility of the logic.\r\n- However, I have improved readability by using ternary operators, but I'm wondering if this is the right direction to go, or if I should refactor it as a method-by-method separation.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Make sure gitHub actions can pass.

What is the purpose of the change?\r\nTwo tests under module dubbo-common are detected as Order-Dependent flaky tests:\r\n`org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.DubboAppenderTest.testAvailable`\r\n`org.apache.dubbo.common.utils.DubboAppenderTest.testAppend`\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I modified the test setup to ensure that each unit test starts with an independent state by resetting the DubboAppender in the @BeforeEach method. Currently, all tests rely on the tearDown() method annotated with @AfterEach to clear the state. However, in unit testing, it is essential for each test to be independent and not depend on the state left by previous tests. If a test fails in a way that prevents tearDown() from running (e.g., due to an unexpected exception or forced termination), it can result in residual state in logList, causing dependencies between tests and breaking test isolation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I replaced assumeTrue() and assumeFalse() with assertThat() to ensure that tests fail with clear feedback when conditions are not met, rather than being skipped. Using assertions is better to report failures directly, rather than directly skipping a test when a condition is not met.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Make sure gitHub actions can pass.

What is the purpose of the change?\r\nThree tests under module `dubbo-common` are detected as Order-Dependent flaky tests:\r\n`dubbo-common\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\dubbo\\common\\threadpool\\support\\eager\\TaskQueueTest.java#testOffer2`\r\n`dubbo-common\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\dubbo\\common\\threadpool\\support\\eager\\TaskQueueTest.java#testOffer3`\r\n`dubbo-common\\src\\test\\java\\org\\apache\\dubbo\\common\\threadpool\\support\\eager\\TaskQueueTest.java#testOffer4`\r\nThere exists circumstances which if queue or executor retain modifications from a previous test (e.g., adding elements or changing state), subsequent tests may inherit an altered state. Tests like testOffer3 and testOffer4 manipulate executor properties such as pool size and active count. If they run in an order where a test expecting an empty state follows one that fills or modifies the queue, the test could fail or produce flaky results. \r\nThis approach modify TaskQueueTest class by defining queue and executor as class-level variables and initializing them in the @BeforeEach method to ensure each test starts with a fresh and consistent state. This approach prevents potential state contamination between tests, promoting better test isolation and reliability, also ensures that all tests share a consistent setup foundation.\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [GitHub_issue](https://github.com/apache/dubbo/issues) field for the change.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test to verify your logic correction. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add sample in [dubbo samples](https://github.com/apache/dubbo-samples) project.\r\n- [x] Make sure gitHub actions can pass.
