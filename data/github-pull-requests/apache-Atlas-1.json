<code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> to further address CVE-2020-8908 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/4011\">#4011</a>) and CVE-2023-2976 (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/2575\">#2575</a>). (feb83a1c8f)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While CVE-2020-8908 was officially closed when we deprecated <code>Files.createTempDir</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v30.0\">Guava 30.0</a>, we've heard from users that even recent versions of Guava have been listed as vulnerable in <em>other</em> databases of security vulnerabilities. In response, we've reimplemented the method (and the very rarely used <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> class, which had a similar issue) to eliminate the insecure behavior entirely. This change could technically affect users in a number of different ways (discussed under &quot;Incompatible changes&quot; below), but in practice, the only problem users are likely to encounter is with Windows. If you are using those APIs under Windows, you should skip 32.0.0 and go straight to <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a> which fixes the problem. (Unfortunately, we didn't think of the Windows problem until after the release. And while we <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava#important-warnings\">warn that <code>common.io</code> in particular may not work under Windows</a>, we didn't intend to regress support.) Sorry for the trouble.</p>\n<h4>Incompatible changes</h4>\n<p>Although this release bumps Guava's major version number, it makes <strong>no binary-incompatible changes to the <code>guava</code> artifact</strong>.</p>\n<p>One change could cause issues for Widows users, and a few other changes could cause issues for users in more usual situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The new implementations of <code>Files.createTempDir</code> and <code>FileBackedOutputStream</code> <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6535\">throw an exception under Windows</a>.</strong> This is fixed in <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v32.0.1\">32.0.1</a>. Sorry for the trouble.</li>\n<li><code>guava-gwt</code> now <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/google/guava/issues/6627\">requires</a> GWT <a href=\"https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt/releases/tag/2.10.0\">2.10.0</a>.</li>\n<li>This release makes a binary-incompatible change to a <code>@Beta</code> API in the <strong>separate artifact</strong> <code>guava-testlib</code>. Specifically, we changed the return type of <code>TestingExecutors.sameThreadScheduledExecutor</code> to <code>ListeningScheduledExecutorService</code>. The old return type was a package-private class, which caused the Kotlin compiler to produce warnings. (dafaa3e435)</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

repository maintainers,\r\n\r\nI am developing a model designed to automatically generate concise and accurate summaries for open-source repositories. This model is intended to produce a one-sentence summary that briefly describes the main functions and purposes of the project. To validate the effectiveness of this summary and to further refine my model, I propose to trial my autogenerated summary in summary.md file.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of adding this summary is to quickly convey the core value of the repository in a manner that is genuinely useful to readers. Please evaluate the accuracy and practicality of this summary by scoring it on a scale from 1 to 10(1 is the worst and 10 is the best), assessing how well it succinctly communicates the project's essence. Your feedback will be crucial in helping me improve the accuracy and relevance of the model.\r\n\r\nThe submission attached includes the summary generated by my model. Please review this description and provide your scoring and any specific feedback. If you have any questions or require additional information, feel free to contact me at any time.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your valuable time and support!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nZheng
