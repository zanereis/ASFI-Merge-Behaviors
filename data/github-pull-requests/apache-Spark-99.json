It's not an Apache Spark but important for `docker-image-tool.sh` to provide backward compatibility during cross-building. This PR targets for all **future releases**, Apache Spark 3.4.0/3.3.3/3.2.4.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDocker `buildx` v0.10.0 publishes OCI Manifests by default which is not supported by `docker manifest` command like the following.\r\nhttps://github.com/docker/buildx/issues/1509\r\n```\r\n$ docker manifest inspect apache/spark:v3.3.2\r\nno such manifest: docker.io/apache/spark:v3.3.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the published images are working on both AMD64/ARM64 machines, but `docker manifest` cannot be used. For example, we cannot create `latest` tag.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nThis will fix the regression of Docker `buildx`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually builds the multi-arch image and check `manifest`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker manifest inspect apache/spark:v3.3.2\r\n{\r\n   \"schemaVersion\": 2,\r\n   \"mediaType\":

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nThe current default value DS V2 API is a bit inconsistent. The `createTable` API only takes `StructType`, so implementations must know the special metadata key of the default value to access it. The `TableChange` API has the default value as an individual field.\r\n\r\nThis API adds a new `Column` interface, which holds both current default (as a SQL string) and exist default (as a v2 literal). `createTable` API now takes `Column`. This avoids the need of special metadata key and is also more extensible when adding more special cols like generated cols. This is also type-safe and makes sure the exist default is literal. The implementation is free to decide how to encode and store default values. Note: backward compatibility is taken care of.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nbetter DS v2 API for default value\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nno\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nexisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to `pyspark.sql.connect.utils` to keep common codes, especially about dependnecies.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor example, [SPARK-41457](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-41457) added `require_minimum_grpc_version` in `pyspark.sql.pandas.utils` which is actually unrelated from the connect module. we should move all to a separate utils directory for better readability and maintenance. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo, dev-only.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting tests should cover this.","created_at":"2023-02-16T01:04:02Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:48:53Z","closed_at":"2023-02-16T03:04:35Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"d1afe7b223836986defdf24f7f297bc0ae7d4d6a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40047/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40047/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40047/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/1ffce4dee0010d686064765bb732e89755519c16","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:refactor-utils","ref":"refactor-utils","sha":"1ffce4dee0010d686064765bb732e89755519c16","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nRename the CSV data source option `prefersDate` as `preferDate`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nAll the CSV data source options doesn't have a `s` on the verb in the naming. For example, `inferSchema`, `ignoreLeadingWhiteSpace` and `ignoreTrailingWhiteSpace`. \r\nThe renaming makes the naming consistent.\r\nAlso, the title of JIRA https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-39904 uses `preferDate` as well.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the data source option is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR proposes to use `BigInt` instead of `Long` datatype for  conversion of numbers between different radixes, because of this we will get rid of overflows.\r\nThis change allows to convert big numbers, like:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> SELECT CONV(SUBSTRING('0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff', 3), 16, 10);\r\n```\r\nwill give correct result:\r\n`115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935`\r\n\r\n**P.S. According to the NumberConverterBenchmark it work faster with Java 8 and slower with Java 11 and 17.\r\nYou can check benchmark results.**\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nChanges allow to convert big numbers among different radixes.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nUsers could convert big values by using `conv` function, without an overflow.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nBy existing tests + an additional test cases were added

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAlways set `containsNull=true` in the data type returned by `ArrayInsert#dataType`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nPR #39970 fixed an issue where the data type for `array_insert` did not always have `containsNull=true` when the user was explicitly inserting a nullable value into the array. However, that fix does not handle the case where `array_insert` implicitly inserts null values into the array (e.g., when the insertion position is out-of-range):\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select array_insert(array('1', '2', '3', '4'), -6, '5');\r\n23/02/14 16:10:19 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 0)\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat

org.apache.spark.sql.execution.BufferedRowIterator.hasNext(BufferedRowIterator.java:43)\r\n```\r\nBecause we can't know at planning time whether the insertion position will be out of range, we should always set `containsNull=true` on the data type for `array_insert`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nWith the configuration `spark.sql.timestampType`,  TIMESTAMP in Spark is a user-specified alias associated with one of the TIMESTAMP_LTZ and TIMESTAMP_NTZ variations. This is quite complicated to Spark users.\r\n\r\nThere is another option `spark.sql.sources.timestampNTZTypeInference.enabled` for schema inference. I would like to introduce it in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/40005 but having two flags seems too much. After thoughts, I decide to merge `spark.sql.sources.timestampNTZTypeInference.enabled` into `spark.sql.timestampType` and let  `spark.sql.timestampType` control the schema inference behavior.\r\n\r\nWe can have followups to add data source options \"inferTimestampNTZType\" for CSV/JSON/partiton column like JDBC data source did.\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nMake the new feature simpler.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo, the feature is not released yet.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAdd a lot of the existing Dataframe APIs to the Spark Connect Scala Client.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not contain:\r\n- Typed APIs\r\n- Aggregation\r\n- Streaming (not supported by connect just yet)\r\n- NA/Stats functions\r\n- TempView registration.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWe want the Scala Client Dataset to reach parity with the existing Dataset.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a lot of golden tests.\r\n\r\nAdded a number of test cases to the E2E suite for the functionality that requires server

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn v2 writes, make createJobDescription in FileWrite.toBatch not lazy\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nThere is a difference in behavior between v1 writes and v2 writes in the order of events happening when configuring the file writer and the committer.\r\n\r\nv1:\r\n\r\nwriter.prepareWrite()\r\ncommitter.setupJob()\r\nv2:\r\n\r\ncommitter.setupJob()\r\nwriter.prepareWrite()\r\n \r\n\r\nThis is because the `prepareWrite()` call (that is the one performing the call `\r\njob.setOutputFormatClass(classOf[ParquetOutputFormat[Row]])`)\r\nhappens as part of the `createWriteJobDescription` which is `lazy val` in the `toBatch` call and therefore is evaluated after the `committer.setupJob` at the end of the `toBatch`\r\n\r\nThis causes issues when evaluating the committer as some elements might be missing, for example the aforementioned output format class not being set, causing the committer being set up as generic write instead of parquet write.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe fix is very simple and it is to make the `createJobDescription` call non-lazy\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nExisting

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves `TreeNode.multiTransform()` to generate the alternative sequences only if needed and fully dynamically. Consider the following simplified example:\r\n```\r\n(a + b).multiTransform {\r\n  case a => Stream(1, 2)\r\n  case b => Stream(10, 20)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthe result is the cartesian product: `Stream(1 + 10, 2 + 10, 1 + 20, 2 + 20)`.\r\nCurrently `multiTransform` calculates the 2 alternative streams for `a` and `b` **before** start building building the cartesian product stream using `+`. So kind of caches the \"inner\" `Stream(1, 2)` in the beginning and when the \"outer\" stream (`Stream(10, 20)`) iterates from `10` to `20` reuses the cache. Although this caching is sometimes useful it has 2 drawbacks:\r\n- If the \"outer\" (`b` alternatives) stream returns `Seq.emtpy` (to indicate pruning) the alternatives for the `a` are unecessary calculated and will be discarded.\r\n- The \"inner\" stream transformation can't depend on the current \"outer\" stream alternative.\r\n   E.g. let's see the above `a + b` example but we want to transform both `a` and `b` to `1` and `2`, and we want to have only those alternatives where these 2 are transformed equal (`Stream(1 + 1, 2 + 2)`). This is currently it is not possible with a single `multiTransform` call due to the inner stream alternatives are calculated in advance and cached. \r\nBut, if `multiTransform` would be dynamic and the \"inner\" alternatives stream would be recalculated when the \"outer\" alternatives stream iterates then this would be possible:\r\n  ```\r\n  // Cache\r\n  var a_or_b = None\r\n  (a + b).multiTransform {\r\n    case a | b =>\r\n      // Return alternatives from cache if this is not the first encounter\r\n      a_or_b.getOrElse(\r\n        // Besides returning the alternatives for the first encounter, also set up a mechanism to\r\n        // update the cache when the new alternatives are requested.\r\n        Stream(Literal(1), Literal(2)).map { x =>\r\n          a_or_b = Some(Seq(x))\r\n          x\r\n        }.append {\r\n          a_or_b = None\r\n          Seq.empty\r\n        })\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\nPlease note:\r\n- that this is a simplified example and we could have run 2 simple `transforms` to get the exprected 2 expressions, but `multiTransform` can do other orthogonal transformations in the same run (e.g. `c` -> `Seq(100, 200)`) and `multiTransform` has the advantage of returning the results lazlily as a stream.\r\n- the original behaviour of caching \"inner\" alternative streams is still doable and actually our current usecases in `AliasAwareOutputExpression` and in `BroadcastHashJoinExec` still do it as they store the alternatives in advance in maps and the `multiTransform` call just gets the alternatives from those maps when needed. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nImprovement to make `multiTransform` more versatile.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded new

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis fixes how setting for limiting recursive depth is handled in Protobuf functions (`recursive.fields.max.depth`). \r\nOriginal documentation says as setting it to '0' removes the recursive field. But we never did that. We allow at least once. E.g. schema for recursive message 'EventPerson' does not change between the settings '0' or '1'. \r\n\r\nThis fixes it by requiring the max depth to be at least 1. It also fixes how the recursion enfored. \r\nUpdated the tests and added an extra test with new protobuf 'EventPersonWrapper'. \r\n\r\nI will annotate the diff inline pointing to main fixes. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis fixes a bug with enforcing `recursive.fields.max.depth` and clarifies more in the documentation. \r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Unit tests\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-14T08:33:38Z","updated_at":"2023-02-14T23:12:31Z","closed_at":"2023-02-14T23:12:31Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3d6f5680ea808eb0c9642470802eeb6eb06769e5","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4654282764,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABFWq4DA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PROTOBUF","name":"PROTOBUF","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40011/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/40011/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/40011/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/89e0ba5c358a1a20a24b4f4ef36e5f760ec5c318","head":{"label":"rangadi:recursive-depth","ref":"recursive-depth","sha":"89e0ba5c358a1a20a24b4f4ef36e5f760ec5c318","user":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":235638810,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzU2Mzg4MTA=","name":"spark","full_name":"rangadi/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rangadi","id":502522,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwMjUyMg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/502522?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi","html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rangadi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rangadi/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8.

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nIn ANSI SQL mode, function Conv() should return an error if the internal conversion overflows\r\nFor example, before the change:\r\n```\r\n> select conv('fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff', 16, 10)\r\n18446744073709551615\r\n```\r\nAfter the change\r\n```\r\n> select conv('fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff', 16, 10)\r\norg.apache.spark.SparkArithmeticException: [ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW] Overflow in function conv(). If necessary set \"spark.sql.ansi.enabled\" to \"false\" to bypass this error.\r\n== SQL(line 1, position 8) ==\r\nselect conv('fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff', 16, 10)\r\n       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSimilar to the other SQL functions, this PR shows the overflow errors of `conv()` to users under ANSI SQL mode, instead of returning an unexpected number.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, function `conv()` will return an error if the internal conversion overflows\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable` to find the default source.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `DataFrameWriter.saveAsTable` fails when `format` is not specified because protobuf defines `source` as required and it will be an empty string instead of `null`, then `DataFrameWriter` tries to find the data source `\"\"`.\r\n\r\nThe `source` field should be optional to let Spark decide the default source.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsers can call `saveAsTable` without `format`.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nEnabled related

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr cleans up unused declarations in the Yarn module:\r\n\r\n- `YarnSparkHadoopUtil#setEnvFromInputString`: this method Introduced by SPARK-3477 and becomes a unused and no test coverage method after SPARK-17979\r\n\r\n- `YarnSparkHadoopUtil#environmentVariableRegex`: this `val` is only used by `YarnSparkHadoopUtil#setEnvFromInputString`\r\n\r\n- `ApplicationMasterArguments.DEFAULT_NUMBER_EXECUTORS`: this `val` Introduced by SPARK-1946 and replaced by `YarnSparkHadoopUtil.DEFAULT_NUMBER_EXECUTORS` in SPARK-4138, and It was eventually replaced by `config#EXECUTOR_INSTANCES`\r\n\r\n- `ApplicationMaster.EXIT_SECURITY`: this `val` introduced by SPARK-3627 and it is used to represent the exit code of errors related to `System.setSecurityManager`, SPARK-4584 deleted the use of `SecurityManager` and this val is useless.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCode clean up.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSupport `_metadata.file_block_start` and `_metadata.file_block_length` for datasource file metadata columns.\r\n\r\nNote that, it does not support data filter since we only know block start and length after splitting files.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nTo improve the observability.\r\n\r\nCurrently, we have an built-in function `InputFileBlockStart` which has some issues, e.g. not work for join. It's better to encourage people changing to use the metadata column. \r\n\r\nFile block length is also an important information. People can find how Spark splits the big files.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nyes\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nImprove exists test and add

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, DS V2 pushdown could let JDBC dialect decide to push down `OFFSET`, `LIMIT` and table sample. Because some databases doesn't support one of them, so we should keep the default value of these pushdown API false. If one database support the syntax, the JDBC dialect should overwrite the value.\r\nWe also have a lot of JDBC options about push down, such as `pushDownOffset`. Users could change the option value to allow or disallow push down.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis PR have two aims, one is change all JDBC v2 pushdown options to true and change all the dialect's pushdown API to false, another is let the built-in dialects support `OFFSET` and paging query.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo.\r\nJust change the inner implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-13T06:24:29Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T10:58:14Z","closed_at":"2023-03-13T10:58:13Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"1b50527404a36c0bde9cc90a6e36ee38804b7b2d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981471081,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNDcxMDgx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/DOCS","name":"DOCS","color":"79CE54","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39990/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39990/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39990/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/2ee4b4bee443a770faf7b4eff298f116b722ec9f","head":{"label":"beliefer:SPARK-42415","ref":"SPARK-42415","sha":"2ee4b4bee443a770faf7b4eff298f116b722ec9f","user":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":237617513,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMzc2MTc1MTM=","name":"spark","full_name":"beliefer/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"beliefer","id":8486025,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0ODYwMjU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8486025?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer","html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/beliefer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/beliefer/spark","description":"Apache

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nFor the following query\r\n\r\n```\r\n        sql(\r\n          \"\"\"\r\n            |CREATE TABLE app (\r\n            |  uid STRING,\r\n            |  st TIMESTAMP,\r\n            |  ds INT\r\n            |) USING parquet PARTITIONED BY (ds);\r\n            |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n        sql(\r\n          \"\"\"\r\n            |create or replace temporary view view1 as WITH new_app AS (\r\n            |  SELECT a.* FROM app a)\r\n            |SELECT\r\n            |    uid,\r\n            |    20230208 AS ds\r\n            |  FROM\r\n            |    new_app\r\n            |  GROUP BY\r\n            |    1,\r\n            |    2\r\n            |\"\"\".stripMargin)\r\n\r\n        val df = sql(\"select uid from view1\")\r\n        df.show()\r\n```\r\nSpark will throw the following error\r\n```\r\n[GROUP_BY_POS_OUT_OF_RANGE] GROUP BY position 20230208 is not in select list (valid range is [1, 2]).; line 9 pos 4 \r\n```\r\nThis is because the logical plan in `df` is not set as analyzed after changes in https://github.com/apache/spark/commit/6adda258e5155761a861a96af4f5410b8a7f304d#diff-583171e935b2dc349378063a5841c5b98b30a2d57ac3743a9eccfe7bffcb8f2aR126, which sets the result of `inlineCTE(plan)` as analyzed instead. \r\nResolving ordinals is not idempotent. In `df`, the `GROUP BY 1, 2` is resolved as `GROUP BY uid, 20230208`. `Dateset.show()` will resolve the logical plan in `df` again and treat the 20230208 in `GROUP BY uid, 20230208` as ordinals again. Thus the error happens\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nBug fix\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNo, the regression is not released yet.\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a regression introduced by #36885 which broke JsonProtocol's ability to parse `null` string values: the old Json4S-based parser would correctly parse null literals, whereas the new code rejects them via an overly-strict type check.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves this problem by relaxing the type checking in `extractString` so that `null` literals in JSON can be parsed as `null` strings.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFix a regression which prevents the history server from parsing certain types of event logs which contain null strings, including stacktraces containing generated code frames and ExceptionFailure messages where the exception message is `null`.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nAdded new unit test in JsonProtocolSuite.","created_at":"2023-02-11T02:09:13Z","updated_at":"2023-02-13T04:47:17Z","closed_at":"2023-02-11T05:54:52Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e3218f11c1352e6bf72e521de16fe1365883edc7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"xinrong-meng","id":47337188,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ3MzM3MTg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47337188?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng","html_url":"https://github.com/xinrong-meng","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinrong-meng/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39973/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39973/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39973/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f818ab5ffbd08ba9e8e8b2c9c593624a7b283454","head":{"label":"JoshRosen:SPARK-42403-handle-null-strings-in-json-protocol-read-path","ref":"SPARK-42403-handle-null-strings-in-json-protocol-read-path","sha":"f818ab5ffbd08ba9e8e8b2c9c593624a7b283454","user":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":22238710,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMjIzODcxMA==","name":"spark","full_name":"JoshRosen/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"JoshRosen","id":50748,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50748?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen","html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JoshRosen/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/JoshRosen/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nIn the `DataType` instance returned by `ArrayInsert#dataType` and `ArrayAppend#dataType`, set `containsNull` to true if either\r\n\r\n- the input array has `containsNull` set to true\r\n- the expression to be inserted/appended is nullable.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThe following two queries return the wrong answer:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select array_insert(array(1, 2, 3, 4), 5, cast(null as int));\r\n[1,2,3,4,0] <== should be [1,2,3,4,null]\r\nTime taken: 3.879 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\nspark-sql> select array_append(array(1, 2, 3, 4), cast(null as int));\r\n[1,2,3,4,0] <== should be [1,2,3,4,null]\r\nTime taken: 0.068 seconds, Fetched 1 row(s)\r\nspark-sql> \r\n```\r\nThe following two queries throw a `NullPointerException`:\r\n```\r\nspark-sql> select array_insert(array('1', '2', '3', '4'), 5, cast(null as string));\r\n23/02/10 11:24:59 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 0.0 in stage 2.0 (TID 2)\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.codegen.UnsafeWriter.write(UnsafeWriter.java:110)\r\n\tat

org.apache.spark.sql.catalyst.expressions.GeneratedClass$GeneratedIteratorForCodegenStage1.processNext(Unknown Source)\r\n...\r\nspark-sql> \r\n```\r\nThe bug arises because both `ArrayInsert` and `ArrayAppend` use the first child's data type as the function's data type. That is, it uses the first child's `containsNull` setting, regardless of whether the insert/append operation might produce an array containing a null value.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nNew unit tests.\r\n","created_at":"2023-02-10T23:35:38Z","updated_at":"2023-03-28T16:39:10Z","closed_at":"2023-02-13T06:49:54Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ea17f4b5cdbffb10ae8fafab147c4675e7fa2063","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39970/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39970/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39970/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/18bbc4da80e511483a4e6e5cedd8c99ffd24600d","head":{"label":"bersprockets:array_insert_anomaly","ref":"array_insert_anomaly","sha":"18bbc4da80e511483a4e6e5cedd8c99ffd24600d","user":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":115567071,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTU1NjcwNzE=","name":"spark","full_name":"bersprockets/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bersprockets","id":21131848,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMTMxODQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21131848?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets","html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bersprockets/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bersprockets/spark","description":"Mirror

code logic of the configmap max size validation lacks extra content\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to add the extra content of the configmap into the configmap max size validation\r\n\r\nIn each configmap, Spark adds an extra content in a fixed format,this extra content of the configmap is as belows:\r\n  spark.kubernetes.namespace: default\r\n  spark.properties: |\r\n    #Java properties built from Kubernetes config map with name: spark-exec-b47b438630eec12d-conf-map\r\n    #Wed Feb 08 20:10:19 CST 2023\r\n    spark.kubernetes.namespace=default\r\n\t\r\nThe example specific content comes from the command output:\r\nkubectl get cm spark-exec-b47b438630eec12d-conf-map -o yaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\ndata:\r\n  spark.kubernetes.namespace: default\r\n  spark.properties: |\r\n    #Java properties built from Kubernetes config map with name: spark-exec-b47b438630eec12d-conf-map\r\n    #Wed Feb 08 20:10:19 CST

change?\r\n\r\nThe major of this pr is the same to the jira SPARK-42344.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nLocal test\r\nTEST CASE 1:\r\n1.mock a file named log4j.properties in spark home directory\r\n\r\n\r\n2.the file name length is 16,and the extra content size is 163.\r\nset the size of the log4j.properties to:\r\n1048576 - 163 -16 = 1048397\r\n\r\n3.truncate the file to

1048576.\r\nThere is only one data in configmap spark-exec-d09ef186354c6ebe-conf-map\r\nkubectl get cm\r\nNAME                                   DATA   AGE\r\ningress-traefik                        1

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n`AppStatusStore.createLiveStore` will return `RocksDB` backend `AppStatusStore` when `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR` or `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR`  is configured, it should be closed in finally block to release resources for test cases.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 test suites use `AppStatusStore.createLiveStore` function: \r\n\r\n- `AppStatusStoreSuite`: one case not close `AppStatusStore`\r\n- `StagePageSuite`: already call close in `finally` block \r\n- `AllExecutionsPageSuite`: already call close in `after`\r\n- `SQLAppStatusListenerSuite`: already call close in `after` \r\n\r\nand only `AppStatusStoreSuite` has `AppStatusStore` without manual closing, so this pr has made the following changes：\r\n\r\n- For `SPARK-36038: speculation summary should not be present if there are no speculative tasks` in `AppStatusStoreSuite`, add close `AppStatusStore` in finally block\r\n- For `SPARK-26260: summary should contain only successful tasks' metrics (store = $hint)`, move the existing `AppStatusStore.close` to the finally block\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nCall `AppStatusStore.close` in the finally block to release

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFixes `DataFrame.unpivot` to raise the same error class when the `values` argument is an empty list/tuple.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `DataFrame.unpivot` raises a different error class, `UNPIVOT_REQUIRES_VALUE_COLUMNS` for PySpark vs. `UNPIVOT_VALUE_DATA_TYPE_MISMATCH` for Spark Connect.\r\n\r\nIn `Unpivot`, an empty list/tuple as `values` argument is different from `None`. It should handle them differently.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n`DataFrame.unpivot` on Spark Connect will raise the same error class as PySpark.\r\n\r\n### How

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds details to non-fatal errors to raise a proper exception in the Python client, which makes `df.sample` raise `IllegalArgumentException` as same as PySpark, except for the timing that is delayed to call actions.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently `SparkConnectService` does not add details for `NonFatal` exceptions to the `PRCStatus`, so the Python client can't detect the exception properly and raises `SparkConnectGrpcException` instead.\r\n\r\nIt also should have the details for the Python client.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nUsers will see a proper exception when they call `df.sample` with illegal arguments, but in a different timing.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nEnabled `DataFrameParityTests.test_sample`.","created_at":"2023-02-09T22:51:24Z","updated_at":"2023-02-09T23:48:57Z","closed_at":"2023-02-09T23:48:57Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e03198cc37e763c842802367d36fb744328bffa4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39957/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/39957/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/39957/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/241657196ae41f10198915006aa3be6da7620aa5","head":{"label":"ueshin:issues/SPARK-42338/sample","ref":"issues/SPARK-42338/sample","sha":"241657196ae41f10198915006aa3be6da7620aa5","user":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":17234665,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNzIzNDY2NQ==","name":"apache-spark","full_name":"ueshin/apache-spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"ueshin","id":506656,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUwNjY1Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/506656?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin","html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ueshin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/ueshin/apache-spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nWhen run Spark UTs with export env `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR`, there are some  cases not cleaned `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR` directory after test.\r\n\r\nFor example, `LauncherBackendSuite`, \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/201a91bab0e3d540ee262bd73b597b137f3f987b/core/src/test/scala/org/apache/spark/launcher/LauncherBackendSuite.scala#L70-L72\r\n\r\n\r\n`handle.kill()` gives `AppStatusStore.close` no chance to execute, and `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR` will not cleaned up.\r\n\r\nSo this pr introduces the `cleanupUIDirIfNecessary` function for `SparkFunSuite` to ensure that `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR` will be cleaned up after test. At the same time, the audit log is added to the `cleanupUIDirIfNecessary` function to facilitate the follow-up investigation of cases that do not clean up `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR` normally\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nAdd a protection mechanism to ensure that `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR` is cleaned up at the same time, which is more friendly to developers and does not need to manually clean up residual files.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo, just for test with export env `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n- Pass Github Actions\r\n- Manual test:\r\n\r\nrun `build/sbt clean \"core/testOnly *LauncherBackendSuite\"`\r\n\r\n**Before**\r\n\r\nwe can see the residual spark-ui dirs in `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR` after test:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspark-ui-0a416dc8-8732-4b1d-a447-7ce602699411\tspark-ui-f6ebf199-41c9-4520-b83e-a82f77df55ce\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**\r\n\r\nNo files in `LIVE_UI_LOCAL_STORE_DIR` after test, and we can see the following logs in unit-tests.log\r\n\r\n```\r\n===== FINISHED o.a.s.launcher.LauncherBackendSuite: 'standalone/client: launcher handle' =====\r\n\r\n23/02/10 11:44:41.655 pool-1-thread-1 WARN LauncherBackendSuite: The number of UI dirs not cleaned is

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, DS V2 pushdown force push down `LIMIT` clause and `OFFSET` clause to underlying databases. The behavior is not correct. For example, Oracle and MsSQLServer doesn't support `LIMIT` clause. DS V2 pushdown could let JDBC dialect decide to push down `OFFSET` and `LIMIT`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n1. If the underlying database don't support `LIMIT` clause or `OFFSET` clause, the corresponding dialect could rejects push down them.\r\n2. Although some underlying database don't support `LIMIT` clause or `OFFSET` clause,  the corresponding dialect have a lot of trick to finish the same function.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nNew feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nNew test

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nSimilar to #38223, improve the error messages when a Python method provided to `DataFrame.mapInPandas` returns a Pandas DataFrame that does not match the expected schema.\r\n\r\nWith\r\n```Python\r\ndf = spark.range(2).withColumn(\"v\", col(\"id\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Mismatching column names:**\r\n```Python\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: it, \"id long, val long\").show()\r\n# was: KeyError: 'val'\r\n# now: RuntimeError: Column names of the returned pandas.DataFrame do not match specified schema.\r\n#      Missing: val  Unexpected: v\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Python function not returning iterator:**\r\n```Python\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: 1, \"id long\").show()\r\n# was: TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable\r\n# now: TypeError: Return type of the user-defined function should be iterator of pandas.DataFrame, but is <class 'int'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Python function not returning iterator of pandas.DataFrame:**\r\n```Python\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: [1], \"id long\").show()\r\n# was: TypeError: Return type of the user-defined function should be Pandas.DataFrame, but is <class 'int'>\r\n# now: TypeError: Return type of the user-defined function should be iterator of pandas.DataFrame, but is iterator of <class 'int'>\r\n# sometimes: ValueError: A field of type StructType expects a pandas.DataFrame, but got: <class 'list'>\r\n# now: TypeError: Return type of the user-defined function should be iterator of pandas.DataFrame, but is iterator of <class 'list'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Mismatching types (ValueError and TypeError):**\r\n```Python\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: it, \"id int, v string\").show()\r\n# was: pyarrow.lib.ArrowTypeError: Expected a string or bytes dtype, got int64\r\n# now: pyarrow.lib.ArrowTypeError: Expected a string or bytes dtype, got int64\r\n#      The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:\r\n#      TypeError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (int64) with name 'v' to Arrow Array (string).\r\n\r\ndf.mapInPandas(lambda it: [pdf.assign(v=pdf[\"v\"].apply(str)) for pdf in it], \"id int, v double\").show()\r\n# was: pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert '0' with type str: tried to convert to double\r\n# now: pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: Could not convert '0' with type str:

\"id int, v double\").show()\r\n# was: ValueError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (object) to Arrow Array (double).\r\n#      It can be caused by overflows or other unsafe conversions warned by Arrow. Arrow safe type check can be disabled\r\n#      by using SQL config `spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely`.\r\n# now: ValueError: Exception thrown when converting pandas.Series (object) with name 'v' to Arrow Array (double).\r\n#      It can be caused by overflows or other unsafe conversions warned by Arrow. Arrow safe type check can be disabled\r\n#      by using SQL config `spark.sql.execution.pandas.convertToArrowArraySafely`.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nExisting errors are generic (`KeyError`) or meaningless (`'int' object is not iterable`). The errors should help users in spotting the mismatching columns by naming them.\r\n\r\nThe schema of the returned Pandas DataFrames can only be checked during processing the DataFrame, so such errors are very expensive. Therefore, they should be expressive.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nThis only changes error messages, not behaviour.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nTests all cases of schema mismatch for
