Users should not use the classes in those package, because they may change in any SIS version without notice. Prior to SIS 1.4, those packages were identified by naming conventions. Anything starting with `org.apache.sis.internal.` is excluded from Javadoc and should be ignored by users. However this convention is unconvenient for SIS developers, because the `internal` part in package name cause related package to appear far from each other. As SIS become bigger, the internal packages became more and more confusion.\r\n\r\nSince JPMS modularisation, the internal naming convention is no longer needed. Instead the `module-info.java` file declares explicitly which packages are exported, and packages not in this list are invisible to users. Consequently we can rename the internal packages to something much closer to where they are used.\r\n\r\nJIRA task:

pull request is a major change for Apache SIS developers and for users who compile from source code, but should be transparent for users of the binaries. This pull request contains four inter-dependent tasks:\r\n\r\n* Migration from Maven to Gradle build system, necessary because the features implemented by other tasks require more flexibility than what Maven provides.\r\n* Change of source code layout from _Package Hierarchy_ to _Module Source Hierarchy_.\r\n* Replacement of `core`, `storage`, `cloud`, `application`, `profile` groups by a new set of groups: `endorsed`, `incubator` and `optional`.\r\n* Addition of `module-info.java` files for JPMS modularisation.\r\n\r\nMore details are provided in the [Apache SIS modularisation page](https://geomatys.github.io/draft/Modularization.html) and [announced on the developer mailing list](https://lists.apache.org/thread/xqnydv188cxom22forz3j8bbkbtv8g14).

merge request contains a series of commits preparing the Apache SIS code base for modularisation. It does not  apply the modularisation itself (i.e. those commits do not add any `module-info.java` file yet), but it fixes a number of problems that need to be resolved first. Those problems are mostly because JPMS enforces stronger encapsulation. For example resource files can not longer be accessed with `Class.getResource(…)` from outside the module containing the resources. Attempts to modularize Apache SIS without those commits result in many test failures. All commits in this pull request appear to be necessary for resolving those test failures. We move those commits before JPMS modularisation for more extensive tests before modularisation.\r\n\r\nThe fist commit is 01102b16ed685628b6c0d0a3d9013617c7918b28 — Remove `DefaultFactories.buildIn(…)` method, replaced by public static `provider()` methods in factory classes.

of the new style package added in the previous commit. Those classes are derived from OGC Symbology Encoding (SE) 1.1.0 specification.\r\n\r\n# Summary of changes:\r\n\r\n* Remove dependency to GeoAPI-pending interfaces (see below).\r\n* Warning resolutions for raw parametric types and unchecked casts.\r\n* Add some properties defined by the SE standard but missing in the classes.\r\n* Empty placeholders when addition of missing properties would be too much work.\r\n* Use `java.util.Optional` for better identification of which properties are optional.\r\n* Add some (not all) JAXB annotations, as a help for identifying mandatory properties.\r\n* Lazy initialization of (sometime standardized) default values of mandatory properties.\r\n* Add credits to OGC GeoAPI 2 contributors since GeoAPI was a source of inspiration.\r\n* Set version number to 1.5 (we will not include this package in SIS 1.4 release).\r\n* Documentation.\r\n\r\n# Removal of GeoAPI-pending dependency\r\n\r\nThe most important change is the removal of usages of GeoAPI-pending interfaces. The GeoAPI `org.opengis.style` package is not part of a formal GeoAPI release. It is currently found only in the \"GeoAPI-pending\" module, which is not released. Those interfaces were based on XML encoding as defined in OGC 05-077r4 standard. Using XML schema instead of UML models has many drawbacks shown in OGC meetings. UML abstract model was not available when `org.opengis.style` was first designed. But today, the ISO 19117:2012 standard evolved with a more elaborated model. There is also various OGC working groups actively working on new style standards, with goals such as better representation of 3D data. For those reasons, the style interfaces in GeoAPI-pending may change and it would premature to commit to them.\r\n\r\nNote that the GeoAPI-pending dependency was only on the SIS development branch. The SIS `master` branch does not depend on GeoAPI-pending and shall never do. Consequently this issue must be resolved before the previous commit can be merged to `master`.\r\n    \r\nJIRA issue:

both various possible input format and drivers, it is very complicated to ensure that content probing never launch unexpected errors. To mitigate such problem, we modify current fail-fast strategy to try other providers before raising errors.\r\n\r\nThis has multiple advantages: \r\n1. Instead of getting one error at once, if multiple providers are unstable, a report with all catched errors is returned at once, allowing to spot multiple bugs (and therefore, allow to fix them) at once. \r\n2. Also, if an unstable provider cause an error, the operation can still succeed if the required provider is tested after the failing one.","created_at":"2021-03-04T13:44:51Z","updated_at":"2022-01-19T16:36:57Z","closed_at":"2022-01-19T16:36:56Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"a60479096cdc9ea4ddb4199feff9ffd98826f05d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":43020058,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0MzAyMDA1OA==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"84b6eb","default":true,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/pulls/21/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/pulls/21/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/issues/21/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/sis/statuses/53eefbb393ef76d5fc381e06d23da7f5efc4c2cf","head":{"label":"apache:refactor/failure_upon_store_discovery","ref":"refactor/failure_upon_store_discovery","sha":"53eefbb393ef76d5fc381e06d23da7f5efc4c2cf","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":10616263,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDYxNjI2Mw==","name":"sis","full_name":"apache/sis","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/sis","description":"Java

tried to properly declare JAXB dependency through [Jakarta artifacts](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-ri#-using-jaxb-with-maven).\r\n\r\nThis work is not complete, but I cannot go further, as I lack some knowledge about current workarounds in SIS project. For now, the runtime of JAXB is embedded at compile time so we can get rid of the `JAXBNamespacePrefixMapper` dependency.\r\n\r\nHope it helps
