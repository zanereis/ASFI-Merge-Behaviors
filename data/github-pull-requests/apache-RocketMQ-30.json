Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

reading the RocketMQ source code, I found that there are some areas that could be optimized\r\n\r\n1.The getData(final long offset) function in the DledgerCommitLog.java is used to get data according to the offset. In Dledger, dividedCommitlogOffset is used to separate the old commitlog from dledger commitlog, so the getData(final long offset) function should judge if offset is in old commitlog or dledger commitlog. But getData(final long offset) function repeats the judgment of whether the offset is in old commitlog or dledger commitlog. So the if statement can be deleted.\r\n\r\n2.The checkMessageAndReturnSize(ByteBuffer byteBuffer, final boolean checkCRC,final boolean readBody) function in the DledgerCommitLog.java is called when build the DispatchRequest. The same with getData function, it should judge whether the byteBuffer is in old commitlog or dledger commitlog.The following figure shows the data format in both modes，we can see that the first field is magic in dledger, the value of magic has two value: DLedgerMmapFileStore.CURRENT_MAGIC(1) or MmapFileList.BLANK_MAGIC_CODE(-1). In old commitlog, this field is TOTALSIZE and the value in this field must be gt 1(every commitlog will be free at least 8 bytes). So we can judge the bytebuffer from the first four bytes，if the value of the first four bytes is gt 1，then the bytebuffer is in old commitlog.\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25401190/111956937-5a9a1e80-8b26-11eb-8642-7b69ec5ae400.png)\r\nIn addition，isInrecoveringOldCommitlog is used to indicate that it is the first time to load mixed commitlog, need to recover the commitlog.

reading the RocketMQ source code, I found that there are some areas that could be optimized\r\n\r\n1.The getData(final long offset) function in the DledgerCommitLog.java is used to get data according to the offset. In Dledger, dividedCommitlogOffset is used to separate the old commitlog from dledger commitlog, so the getData(final long offset) function should judge if offset is in old commitlog or dledger commitlog. But getData(final long offset) function repeats the judgment of whether the offset is in old commitlog or dledger commitlog. So the if statement can be deleted.\r\n\r\n2.The checkMessageAndReturnSize(ByteBuffer byteBuffer, final boolean checkCRC,final boolean readBody) function in the DledgerCommitLog.java is called when build the DispatchRequest. The same with getData function, it should judge whether the byteBuffer is in old commitlog or dledger commitlog.The following figure shows the data format in both modes，we can see that the first field is magic in dledger, the value of magic has two value: DLedgerMmapFileStore.CURRENT_MAGIC(1) or MmapFileList.BLANK_MAGIC_CODE(-1). In old commitlog, this field is TOTALSIZE and the value in this field must be gt 1(every commitlog will be free at least 8 bytes). So we can judge the bytebuffer from the first four bytes，if the value of the first four bytes is gt 1，then the bytebuffer is in old commitlog.\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25401190/111950866-d348ad00-8b1d-11eb-9bf0-de5ba4d33a15.png)\r\nIn addition，isInrecoveringOldCommitlog is used to indicate that it is the first time to load mixed commitlog, need to recover the commitlog. It has nothing to do with whether the byteBuffer is in old commitlog or dledger commitlog. So I think the if statement can be

fundamental changes for other submodule.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [ ] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

the retry message has delay property when schedule message service write into commitlog from PropertiesString.\r\nit will still send into delay topic (SCHEDULE_TOPIC_XXX), Send it back to DLQ when it is due.\r\n\r\nthe DLQ message should be discovered by the user as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\ncoverage the message delay level when send into DLQ\r\n\r\n## Verifying this

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

codes to support RIP-19\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

issue(#2708) showed , the way to fix this is to take care of RemotingException specially, if queryOffsetRequest got timeout, we should execute pullRequestLater other then use -1 to request. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- \r\n\r\n- [x]  Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n\r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

below. When flush fails, only an error is reported, but the client is not notified 。\r\nIf there is an error, a try catch will be performed .Then log.error(\"Error occurred when force data to disk.\", e);\r\nBut there is no error code returned to the client, and the client still thinks that the send is successful.\r\n\r\npublic int flush(final int flushLeastPages) {\r\n        if (this.isAbleToFlush(flushLeastPages)) {\r\n            if (this.hold()) {\r\n                int value = getReadPosition();\r\n\r\n                try {\r\n                    //We only append data to fileChannel or mappedByteBuffer, never both.\r\n                    if (writeBuffer != null || this.fileChannel.position() != 0) {\r\n                        this.fileChannel.force(false);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        this.mappedByteBuffer.force();\r\n                    }\r\n                } catch (Throwable e) {\r\n                    log.error(\"Error occurred when force data to disk.\", e);\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                this.flushedPosition.set(value);\r\n                this.release();\r\n            } else {\r\n                log.warn(\"in

this.getFlushedPosition();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nSo I add an error code FLUSH_DISK_FAILED, and then notify the client to deal with it 。\r\n\r\nI have used mvn to package and run it locally, which can fix this problem 。\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2021-03-03T02:55:31Z","updated_at":"2021-11-10T09:40:00Z","closed_at":"2021-11-10T09:40:00Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"2929448ca2ef59d19a74f2e70a565e8eeea14f67","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":491543180,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw0OTE1NDMxODA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/type/bug","name":"type/bug","color":"ee0701","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/20","html_url":"https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/milestone/20","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/milestones/20/labels","id":7232272,"node_id":"MI_kwDOBHrsl84AblsQ","number":20,"title":"4.9.3","description":"","creator":{"login":"vongosling","id":635581,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzNTU4MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/635581?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling","html_url":"https://github.com/vongosling","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/vongosling/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":0,"closed_issues":187,"state":"closed","created_at":"2021-10-08T01:11:01Z","updated_at":"2023-04-27T00:07:43Z","due_on":"2021-11-30T08:00:00Z","closed_at":"2022-02-27T10:25:43Z"},"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/2707/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/2707/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2707/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/b335ba550a4fcd19755df7f7aa0090443e5b485e","head":{"label":"iamqq23ue:master","ref":"master","sha":"b335ba550a4fcd19755df7f7aa0090443e5b485e","user":{"login":"iamqq23ue","id":70457992,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNDU3OTky","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70457992?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue","html_url":"https://github.com/iamqq23ue","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/iamqq23ue/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:develop","ref":"develop","sha":"ec985ee67354a55607c3b5fde2e110dfb1268fea","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":75164823,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NTE2NDgyMw==","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"apache/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/

sure set the target branch to `develop`**\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nDid some enhancement on code in order to make it more suitable for reading\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n1: removed some code lines which are not needed anymore \r\n2: added some default code in switch - case block since seems lack of it\r\n3: added some @Override code line before implementation function due to lack of it, reduce confusion\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\n`java.net.NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces()` is a heavyweight operation, this pull request will cache NetworkInterfaces to reduce the time taken to access network card information\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\n* Add `org.apache.rocketmq.common.NetworkInterfaceUtil` to cache NetworkInterfaces \r\n* Add `getLocalAddress`, `normalizeHostAddress` to `org.apache.rocketmq.common.MixAll`\r\n* Update `java.net.NetworkInterface.getNetworkInterfaces()` to `NetworkInterfaceUtil.getNetworkInterfaces()`\r\n* Deprecate `getLocalAddress`, `normalizeHostAddress` of `org.apache.rocketmq.remoting.common.RemotingUtil`\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [x] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-26T04:28:03Z","updated_at":"2021-01-31T03:13:44Z","closed_at":"2021-01-31T03:13:44Z","merged_at":"2021-01-31T03:13:44Z","merge_commit_sha":"ea53d441320738b62b478c64e46d206074d2593c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/2630/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/2630/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2630/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/ec6430435ab380662c94bb260258c2f491c85781","head":{"label":"jjz921024:dev-dash","ref":"dev-dash","sha":"ec6430435ab380662c94bb260258c2f491c85781","user":{"login":"jjz921024","id":19649281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjQ5Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19649281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024","html_url":"https://github.com/jjz921024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":296318179,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyOTYzMTgxNzk=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"jjz921024/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jjz921024","id":19649281,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NjQ5Mjgx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19649281?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024","html_url":"https://github.com/jjz921024","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jjz921024/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/jjz921024/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License Agreement](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas).\r\n","created_at":"2021-01-22T11:18:57Z","updated_at":"2023-07-24T00:08:46Z","closed_at":"2023-07-24T00:08:46Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"c79f5952f3d33005bcf3893b9601b8f843361cad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":4509456568,"node_id":"LA_kwDOBHrsl88AAAABDMjYuA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/2619/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/2619/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/issues/2619/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/rocketmq/statuses/46875210d85a79bf4c196a4b787a5d18d3d9a14e","head":{"label":"xxd763795151:topic_delete_broker","ref":"topic_delete_broker","sha":"46875210d85a79bf4c196a4b787a5d18d3d9a14e","user":{"login":"xxd763795151","id":19887530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODg3NTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19887530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151","html_url":"https://github.com/xxd763795151","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":325492226,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjU0OTIyMjY=","name":"rocketmq","full_name":"xxd763795151/rocketmq","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xxd763795151","id":19887530,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5ODg3NTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19887530?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151","html_url":"https://github.com/xxd763795151","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xxd763795151/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xxd763795151/rocketmq","description":"Mirror

contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

sure set the target branch to `develop`**\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nThe original log does not log any error info when sending meessage trace data failed. It`s hard to find the cause of failed on th production environment. And if any people who do not know source code, they even do not know it has sent failed according to log.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nModify log level from info to warn， And printing exception info.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nMore and more software development is being done on ARM64 CPU architecture.\r\nIt would be good if RocketMQ is being regularly tested on ARM64.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nAdd a TravisCI job that runs the build on ARM64 architecture.\r\n\r\nThe ARM64 nodes at TravisCI are available only for Ubuntu 18.04+, i.e. `bionic` and `focal`. \r\nThere is no `jdk: oraclejdk8` for `bionic` so I needed to install it manually from Ubuntu repositories. The extra benefit is the newer JDK build. Travis `oraclejdk8` image comes with 1.8.0_151, while the Ubuntu repository installs 1.8.0_275 (the latest available at the moment). \r\nI've also added caching for the downloaded Maven dependencies. This reduces a bit the job execution time.\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nXXXX\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a Github issue - this PR does not modify RocketMQ anyhow, so I guess there is no need of a separate issue \r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) - no need of new tests\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass - both the unit and IT tests are executed by TravisCI on x86_64 and aarch64 CPU architectures.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

sure set the target branch to `develop`**\r\n\r\n## What is the purpose of the change\r\n\r\nWhen the master change occurs in the DLedger mode, a large number of delay messages and retry messages will be consumed repeatedly due to no delay offset reloading.\r\n\r\n## Brief changelog\r\n\r\nReload the delay offset when master changed\r\n\r\n## Verifying this change\r\n\r\nVerified in my environment\r\n\r\nFollow this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License

Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass.

Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass.

this checklist to help us incorporate your contribution quickly and easily. Notice, `it would be helpful if you could finish the following 5 checklist(the last one is not necessary)before request the community to review your PR`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make sure there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) filed for the change (usually before you start working on it). Trivial changes like typos do not require a Github issue. Your pull request should address just this issue, without pulling in other changes - one PR resolves one issue. \r\n- [x] Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE #123] Fix UnknownException when host config not exist`. Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.\r\n- [x] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\r\n- [x] Write necessary unit-test(over 80% coverage) to verify your logic correction, more mock a little better when cross module dependency exist. If the new feature or significant change is committed, please remember to add integration-test in [test module](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/tree/master/test).\r\n- [x] Run `mvn -B clean apache-rat:check findbugs:findbugs checkstyle:checkstyle` to make sure basic checks pass. Run `mvn clean install -DskipITs` to make sure unit-test pass. Run `mvn clean test-compile failsafe:integration-test`  to make sure integration-test pass.\r\n- [ ] If this contribution is large, please file an [Apache Individual Contributor License
