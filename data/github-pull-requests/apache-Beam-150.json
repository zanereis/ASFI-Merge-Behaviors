logical type expects an argument - the length of the byte[].\r\n\r\nWhen an invalid input value (with length < expectedLength) is provided while building the Row with FixedBytes logical type, `IllegalArgumentException` is expected. But, the Exception is not thrown. The below code illustrates the behaviour:\r\n\r\n```\r\n Schema schema = Schema.builder().addLogicalTypeField(\"char\", FixedBytes.of(10)).build();\r\n byte[] byteArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\r\n Row row = Row.withSchema(schema).withFieldValue(\"char\", byteArray).build();\r\n System.out.println(Arrays.toString(row.getLogicalTypeValue(\"char\", byte[].class)));\r\n```\r\nThe above code prints \"[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\" with length 5 to the console, whereas the expected length of FixedBytes, is 10.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue.\r\nNegative and Positive Test for FixedBytes Logical type are added. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

bundle in Beam today can contain many windows. This often makes using finishBundle correctly tricky. Users are sometimes seen keeping maps in their DoFn of windows seen in a bundle so they can properly process them in finishBundle. We also don't support injecting an OutputReceiver in finishBundle, as there's no good way to associate a window to the output.\r\n\r\nThis PR allows injecting a BoundedWindow or OutputReceiver to the finishBundle function. In this case, the finishBundle will be invoked once per window seen in the bundle. If there is no such parameter, then the previous behavior of invoking finishBundle once is preserved.","created_at":"2020-05-04T16:59:55Z","updated_at":"2020-07-11T01:34:10Z","closed_at":"2020-07-11T01:34:10Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":974794430,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5NzQ3OTQ0MzA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/stale","name":"stale","color":"f9d0c4","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1836391716,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODM2MzkxNzE2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/java","name":"java","color":"001cf2","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842436405,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyNDM2NDA1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/runners","name":"runners","color":"3b087c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1842952021,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxODQyOTUyMDIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/labels/core","name":"core","color":"3b087c","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/11600/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/11600/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/issues/11600/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/beam/statuses/4164a1e68765933c08e223f674b4da1c9b00977a","head":{"label":"reuvenlax:finish_window_bundle","ref":"finish_window_bundle","sha":"4164a1e68765933c08e223f674b4da1c9b00977a","user":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":72963016,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3Mjk2MzAxNg==","name":"incubator-beam","full_name":"reuvenlax/incubator-beam","private":false,"owner":{"login":"reuvenlax","id":21071061,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIxMDcxMDYx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21071061?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax","html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/reuvenlax/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/reuvenlax/incubator-beam","description":"Mirror

PR is an experiment to illustrate a potential strategy for implementing HL7v2IO.ListMessages as a splittable DoFn that carves the sendTime dimension up into time ranges and uses the Messages.List API with filter on sendTime and orderBy sendTime (to make lists monotonically increasing).\r\n\r\nCurrently this initial split is daily and the hope is to leave dynamic splits are left up to the existing implementaion in [OffsetRangeTracker](https://beam.apache.org/releases/javadoc/2.20.0/org/apache/beam/sdk/transforms/splittabledofn/OffsetRangeTracker.html)\r\n\r\n## DISCLAIMER\r\nThis PR is currently a discussion piece to help drive the decision of the future of HL7v2IO.ListMessages. \r\n\r\nIt has excessive logging for demonstrating behavior / debugging and is currently broken.\r\n\r\nCC: @pabloem, @lukecwik \r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n- What are the prototypical tests for validating splitable DoFn's various methods (e.g. SplitRestriction) stability?\r\n- Are there best practices in optimizing inital split? In this case it's impossible to know a head of time how many messages.\r\n- Is there a max recommended initial splitting? For example 100s or 1000s of splits preferrable? For IO connectors I imagine it depends what the QPS limits are of your source/target system are.\r\n- Should I add adaptive throttling similar to DatastoreIO as we are introducing much more parallelism? Are there other methods in splitable dofns for rate limiting requests or indicating that runner can split until you have n currently active splits?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Current Status: Working\r\nStole a lot from OffsetRangetTracker to implement OrderedTimeRageTracker a restriction tracker that assumes that local results sets are ordered by timestamp.\r\n\r\n - [ ] [**Choose reviewer(s)**](https://beam.apache.org/contribute/#make-your-change) and mention them in a comment (`R: @username`).\r\n - [x] Format the pull request title like `[BEAM-XXX] Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `BEAM-XXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue, if applicable.

is minimal benefit in separating these 2 stages, and significant\r\nbenefity in merging them: Gather and Sort encodes incoming\r\nMutationGroups into a List<byte[]> which would contain up to 1GB.\r\nThis is then output (copied) to the CreateBatches where it is decoded\r\nback into MutationGroups.\r\n\r\nRemoving this encode/decode should save up to 2GB of RAM.\r\n\r\nNote, this PR is

automated validation for RTrackers to the DoFn invokers. I ran the\r\nParDo benchmark with and without my change and got similar results, so\r\nthis doesn't seem to have an obvious performance impact.\r\n\r\nNote that the currently documented benchmark number doesn't seem accurate before (or it's just my desktop that's different).\r\n\r\nBenchmark before change:\r\nBenchmarkParDo_EmitSumFn-6   \t  948087\t      1918 ns/op\t     484 B/op\t       4 allocs/op\r\n\r\nBenchmark after change:\r\n`BenchmarkParDo_EmitSumFn-6   \t  681343\t      1919 ns/op\t     521 B/op\t       4 allocs/op`\r\n\r\nNote that exact numbers wavered a bunch. It seemed to average around 1900 ns/op, going as low as 1850 and up to 1950. I chose two examples that had similar runtimes.\r\n\r\nThe error message emitted looks like this to the end-user:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Error received from SDK harness for instruction 2: process bundle failed for instruction 2 using plan 5-6 : <emitted error>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI was toying with making it a bit more descriptive, but it matches the structure you get when the user emits an error from ProcessElement, so I kept it as is for consistency.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

implements the following improvements for HL7v2IO based on initial testing with customer\r\n1. emit early panes rather than blocking on pagination in ListHL7v2Messages. Note, this is because the architecture of this PTransform is such that it fans out from a PCollection of HL7v2 stores (typically just 1) to many, many messages. By default, beam will not emit panes until it estimates all the data has arrived. Because one element is fanning out to (potentially) millions of messages that must be paginated through. Beam only knows \"I'm not done outputting all the values for this single element, so my output must be incomplete\". Unfortunately there is no splitable restriction due to the pagination model not knowing the page tokens ahead of time, this must  happen in a single thread. This change just allows us to start processed the early pages sooner, allowing for a smoother throughput curve of output elements rather than a massive step function when pagination is finally complete.\r\n1. allow end users to use HL7v2MessageCoder in their pipelines by making constructor public.\r\n1. drop output only fields (keeping only data and labels) before calling ingestMessages in HL7v2IO.Write rather than expecting the user to do this. (e.g. in a read from one HL7v2 store write directly to another use case)\r\n\r\nR: @pabloem \r\nCC: @lastomato\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThank you for your contribution!

of #11533.\r\n\r\nFor computing the current output watermark we need to compute the minimum\r\nwatermark hold across all watermark holds. We maintain an in-memory view of all\r\nwatermark holds because iterating over all keys is an expensive operation which\r\nwe only want to do when restoring from a checkpoint, not on every watermark.\r\n\r\nThe watermark view may not be in sync with its backing managed state. This\r\nchange corrects this by maintaining a TreeMap with all watermark holds and\r\nadding additional tests.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

computing the current output watermark we need to compute the minimum\r\nwatermark hold across all watermark holds. We maintain an in-memory view of all\r\nwatermark holds because iterating over all keys is an expensive operation which\r\nwe only want to do when restoring from a checkpoint, not on every watermark.\r\n\r\nThe watermark view may not be in sync with its backing managed state. This\r\nchange corrects this by maintaining a priority queue with all watermark holds\r\nand adding additional tests.\r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master

adds significant latency and memory use. \r\nWhen streaming, end-to-end pipeline latency is important, and many worker threads are executed, meaning that OOM's can frequently occur.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables grouping by default in streaming mode, ensuring lower memory use and faster end-end latency. \r\n\r\nNote, this PR is dependent on PR #11528 \r\n\r\nPost-Commit Tests Status (on master
