Description ##\r\nShould fix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17164 where the root cause is\r\n - BN requires float32 parameters even in fp16 mode\r\n - SymbolBlock takes symbolic graph but didn't check for BatchNorm inside\r\n - In contrast, a normal gluon batchnorm layer will be able to check for this special case just like https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/blob/master/python/mxnet/gluon/nn/basic_layers.py#L360\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your

operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2020-01-03T22:13:56Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T21:33:51Z","closed_at":"2020-01-06T21:33:51Z","merged_at":"2020-01-06T21:33:51Z","merge_commit_sha":"bd7eedf3a43279380750dfc54f081e32891620af","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17212/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17212/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17212/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/e48ba29fe2a76d98711bb515e8929b148f8be211","head":{"label":"zhreshold:fix-symbolblock-bn-fp16","ref":"fix-symbolblock-bn-fp16","sha":"e48ba29fe2a76d98711bb515e8929b148f8be211","user":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":69486423,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2OTQ4NjQyMw==","name":"mxnet","full_name":"zhreshold/mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"zhreshold","id":3307514,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDc1MTQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3307514?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold","html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/zhreshold/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/zhreshold/mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\nThis PR removes the dtype information from `mx.sym.Variable` created from Gluon `Parameter`. Gluon does not need that information anyway (as it performs its own type and shape inference), but it actually makes it impossible to import the model for inference when Gluon's `SymbolBlock` was the source of the model.\r\n\r\nFor example, this code:\r\n```\r\nfrom mxnet import gluon\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nalexnet = gluon.model_zoo.vision.alexnet(pretrained=True, ctx=mx.cpu(),\r\n                                         prefix='model_')\r\ninputs = mx.sym.var('data')\r\nout = alexnet(inputs)\r\ninternals = out.get_internals()\r\noutputs = [internals['model_dense0_relu_fwd_output'],\r\n           internals['model_dense1_relu_fwd_output']]\r\n# Create SymbolBlock that shares parameters with alexnet\r\nfeat_model = gluon.SymbolBlock(outputs, inputs, params=alexnet.collect_params())\r\nx = mx.nd.random.normal(shape=(16, 3, 224, 224))\r\nprint(feat_model(x))\r\n# Save the model\r\nfeat_model.export(\"test_symbolblock\", 0)\r\n# Import the symbolic model for inference\r\nsym, _, _ = mx.model.load_checkpoint('test_symbolblock', 0)\r\n# Change the type of data to float16\r\ne = sym.simple_bind(ctx=mx.gpu(), data=(1,3,224,224), type_dict={'data': 'float16'})\r\n```\r\ncrashes with\r\n```\r\nMXNetError: Error in operator model_conv0_fwd: [17:02:30] src/operator/nn/convolution.cc:297: Check failed: (*in_type)[i] == dtype (0 vs. 2) : This layer requires uniform type. Expected 'float16' v.s. given 'float32' at 'weight'\r\n```\r\nbecause the `weight` Variable has dtype set explicitly to `float32`.\r\n\r\nThis also workarounds a problem in `SymbolBlock` where, due to the fact that graph is not recreated when casting to a different `dtype`, the saved graph still expects `float32` (the default type) for parameters. This code:\r\n```\r\nfrom mxnet import gluon\r\nimport mxnet as mx\r\nalexnet = gluon.model_zoo.vision.alexnet(pretrained=True, ctx=mx.gpu(),\r\n                                         prefix='model_')\r\ninputs = mx.sym.var('data')\r\nout = alexnet(inputs)\r\ninternals = out.get_internals()\r\noutputs = [internals['model_dense0_relu_fwd_output'],\r\n           internals['model_dense1_relu_fwd_output']]\r\n# Create SymbolBlock that shares parameters with alexnet\r\nfeat_model = gluon.SymbolBlock(outputs, inputs, params=alexnet.collect_params())\r\nfeat_model.cast('float16')   # This time cast the model to fp16\r\nx = mx.nd.random.normal(shape=(16, 3, 224, 224), ctx=mx.gpu(), dtype='float16')\r\nprint(feat_model(x))\r\nfeat_model.export(\"test_symbolblock\", 0)\r\nsym, _, _ = mx.model.load_checkpoint('test_symbolblock', 0)\r\ne = sym.simple_bind(ctx=mx.gpu(), data=(1,3,224,224), type_dict={'data': 'float16'})\r\n```\r\ncrashes with the same error as the previous one (`weight` in the graph is `float32`).\r\n\r\nI believe `stype` should also be omitted, for the same reasons - @eric-haibin-lin thoughts?\r\n\r\n@kexinyu FYI\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are

`ci/build_windows.py` this makes 2 commands to build MXNet in a clean windows install.\r\n\r\nBefore the process to setup the required environment required tons of manual and error prone install and

this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nEnhancements for custom subgraph operators in external libraries. \r\n- Adds API to set boolean flag to denote a subgraph operator in an external library\r\n- Removes the requirement to manually implement infer shape/type/storage/mutate/request\r\n- Uses default functions from subgraph/common.h\r\n\r\n## Design ##\r\nIts difficult to implement the full shape/type propagation in an external library for a whole subgraph. Rather that re-implement these complex pieces, we'll use the default functions in the subgraph API. \r\n\r\nStarting from the user in the custom library, the registration is now only:\r\n```\r\nREGISTER_OP(_custom_subgraph_op)\r\n.setParseAttrs(parseAttrs)\r\n.isSubgraphOp(true)\r\n.setCreateOpState(createOpState);\r\n```\r\nHere, setting `isSubgraphOp` means we dont have to register the infer shape/type functions. When re-registering the operator in MXNet, if `isSubgraphOp` is true, then we re-use the functions from the subgraph API:\r\n```\r\nif(isSubgraphOp) {\r\n      using namespace mxnet::op;\r\n      regOp.set_attr<nnvm::FInferType>(\"FInferType\",\r\n                                       DefaultSubgraphOpType, plevel);\r\n      regOp.set_attr<mxnet::FInferShape>(\"FInferShape\",\r\n                                         DefaultSubgraphOpShape, plevel);\r\n      regOp.set_attr<FInferStorageType>(\"FInferStorageType\",\r\n                                        DefaultSubgraphOpStorageType, plevel);\r\n      regOp.set_attr<FResourceRequest>(\"FResourceRequest\",\r\n                                       DefaultSubgraphOpResourceRequest, plevel);\r\n      regOp.set_attr<nnvm::FMutateInputs>(\"FMutateInputs\",\r\n                                          DefaultSubgraphOpMutableInputs, plevel);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-30T16:32:13Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T23:13:52Z","closed_at":"2020-01-02T23:13:52Z","merged_at":"2020-01-02T23:13:52Z","merge_commit_sha":"77c7c3a9346220c9a13f23ae559696d4f4f916aa","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"eric-haibin-lin","id":5545640,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDU2NDA=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5545640?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin","html_url":"https://github.com/eric-haibin-lin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/eric-haibin-lin/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

Description ##\r\n\r\nBoth the `nvinfer1::INetworkDefinition` and `nvinfer1::IBuilder` class has `destroy` method to destruct the object, and can use the RAII class `InferObject`,  but original code before this PR does not use this one. This PR enhanced the robustness, espescially when the function throws. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-28T15:45:32Z","updated_at":"2020-01-10T15:45:34Z","closed_at":"2020-01-10T15:45:17Z","merged_at":"2020-01-10T15:45:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"651eb9d5610464dac2603e64cd110d2bdf63bd8a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review and CI is complete.

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nAdd channel-wise quantization support for FullyConnected, which will bring accuracy benefit for some models such as BERT SQuAD, etc. \r\nThe default quantization keeps the same as now which is using tensor-wise quantization, user can switch to use channel-wise quantization by setting arguments `quantize_granularity=\"channel-wise\"` when calling `quantize_model()`.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

Description ##\r\nFix https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/16937\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nMainly aims to fix the gradients' explosion reported by https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17086. Other enhancements are also enabled, which are listed in the Changes section. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Changes ###\r\n* Flush memory before RNN backward primitive\r\n* Add gluon-rnn unit test for gradients check\r\n* Cache reorder\r\n* Re-write rnn supporting check\r\n* Update OpSignature.AddSign to avoid potential hash collision for rnn-packed memory\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Backward performance should have been improved to some degree as we cached the reorder primitives. A performance comparison will be posted later. Besides, this patch is supposed to have no impact on the Forward path.\r\n\r\n@ciyongch @TaoLv @pengzhao-intel

Description ##\r\nCurrently, many operators utilize `std::stod` to convert strings into floating point numbers. This causes incorrect calculations (#17140, #16134) when the C locale is set to a locale which uses commas (`,`) as decimal separators.\r\n\r\nThis pull request replaces calls to `std::stod` and `std::stof` to the locale-invariant `dmlc::stod` and `dmlc::stof` respectively.\r\n\r\n### The scope of this patch ###\r\n\r\nThis patch should fix a large portion of interactions through Python and JVM frontends, since they use locale-invariant serialization in order to pass parameters into MXNet's C API.\r\n\r\nHowever, frontends which utilize C locale-aware serialization (i.e. call `sprintf` or similar) may break when using locales which don't use `.` as the decimal separator. They will have to be fixed in a separate patch. I also suspect that they are already broken, because operators utilising dmlc-core parameter parsing were already using locale-invariant serialization.\r\n\r\n### Further steps ###\r\nSTL streams are heavily used within the codebase, both for serialization and for forming user-friendly messages. Fortunately, they don't seem to be affected by the C standard library locale settings. However, if someone sets the STL locale by calling [std::locale::global](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/locale/locale/global), MXNet's API will be broken. In order to ensure that this doesn't happen, all streams which are used for serialization will have to be imbued with the \"C\" locale (not the locale set in the C standard library).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to see a more principled approach to serialization in MXNet 2.0, e.g. using a binary format for communication between the frontend and the backend. In addition to solving locale-related issues, this would probably result in a smaller invocation overhead.\r\n\r\n### Locale-invariant serialization vs locale-aware serialization ###\r\n\r\nAs a side-note, using locale-aware serialization is not an option, simply because using `,` as the decimal separator adds ambiguities to tuple serialization, e.g. `(4,4,3)` can be a tuple of 3 integers, or a tuple of 2 floats.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Replace `std::stod` with `dmlc::stod` and `std::stof with `dmlc::stof`.\r\n- [x] Add a test that tests locale invariance for scalar ops.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- May break Julia and R code when using a locale that uses `,` as the decimal separator. However, since there was no consistency between the various operators before, it is not unlikely that the code was already broken.

Description ##\r\nNumpy Operator amax PR\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\n@pengzhao-intel @TaoLv @ZhennanQin @rongzha1 \r\n\r\nThis PR is to address the segmentation fault when calibrating FP32 models in entropy mode (calling `_copyto` op). \r\n\r\n1. not use fallback inputs for `_copyto`\r\n2. add unittest for quantization in entropy mode\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-25T14:20:02Z","updated_at":"2020-01-02T01:38:27Z","closed_at":"2020-01-02T01:37:42Z","merged_at":"2020-01-02T01:37:42Z","merge_commit_sha":"e65fc4bee5b8602b38ba2e419a4ea2e5ce5b7e9a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17173/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17173/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17173/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/d9f58ebefe8e6a99beeeb17d0568dc958f1376e4","head":{"label":"wuxun-zhang:fix_entropy","ref":"fix_entropy","sha":"d9f58ebefe8e6a99beeeb17d0568dc958f1376e4","user":{"login":"wuxun-zhang","id":34727741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI3NzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34727741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/wuxun-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":163937530,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjM5Mzc1MzA=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"wuxun-zhang/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"wuxun-zhang","id":34727741,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0NzI3NzQx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34727741?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang","html_url":"https://github.com/wuxun-zhang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/wuxun-zhang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/wuxun-zhang/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\n\r\nwrongly assert two int8 result before. change to compare fp32 and int8 results.\r\n\r\n@ciyongch @TaoLv @pengzhao-intel \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-25T03:22:01Z","updated_at":"2019-12-30T00:57:47Z","closed_at":"2019-12-30T00:57:47Z","merged_at":"2019-12-30T00:57:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"ffeebe46ab5efa8f713161ed466c47f9609fa8d6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17166/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/17166/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/17166/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/1c059989d55b49a7f4268b5cfad7dea5bfc95892","head":{"label":"xinyu-intel:fix_int8_add_ut","ref":"fix_int8_add_ut","sha":"1c059989d55b49a7f4268b5cfad7dea5bfc95892","user":{"login":"xinyu-intel","id":17897736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17897736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyu-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":123092331,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMjMwOTIzMzE=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"xinyu-intel/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xinyu-intel","id":17897736,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE3ODk3NzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17897736?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel","html_url":"https://github.com/xinyu-intel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xinyu-intel/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xinyu-intel/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2019-12-24T04:28:24Z","updated_at":"2019-12-27T00:44:27Z","closed_at":"2019-12-27T00:44:27Z","merged_at":"2019-12-27T00:44:27Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a14a6acb9c31b0bfc1395a0bc8e9019c73846fd","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":998884732,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5OTg4ODQ3MzI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Quantization","name":"Quantization","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"Issues/Feature

Description ##\r\n\r\n@TaoLv \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nAs title. On master branch\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to

other model configurations\r\n- support quantized eltwise_mul\r\n- add benchmark script\r\n\r\n@pengzhao-intel \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not

[MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

True])\r\na[mask, :] = np.ones((1, 4)) # the (1, 4) tensor is broadcasted onto the target shape of (2, 4)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by

Description ##\r\nAs of jemalloc 5, jemalloc default build can not be used in libraries that `dlopen`ed. However, `libmxnet.so` is `dlopen`ed by Python (ctypes). We can thus not link to system `libjemalloc.so` but must rather link to a `libjemalloc` compiled as part of our build process.\r\n\r\njemalloc 5 is distributed as part of Ubuntu 18.10 and higher, as well as Debian Stable.\r\nUsers on these systems will be unable to compile MXNet with `USE_JEMALLOC=ON` (which is the default).\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the necessary changes.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/17145\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Include 3rdparty/jemalloc\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- We include a patched version of `jemalloc` that adds CMake support.

Description ##\r\nFixes #17105 \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes 2 problems (that together lead to the huge time spent doing fusion reported in #17105).\r\n\r\nThe first problem was the `get_subsets` function - a part of the pointwise fusion graph pass. It involves a step that ensures there are no cycles created in a graph after the fusion step. It does so in 2 steps:\r\n - first it looks at each incompatible node and separates its inputs and outputs into disjoint sets\r\n - then for each node `n` it looks at those separations and creates a set of nodes that are incompatible to be in the same fusion with `n`\r\n\r\nBoth of those steps were improved:\r\n - the first step was optimized via observation that if all inputs to an incompatible node `n` are also incompatible, then the separation set produced by that node is strictly smaller than the ones produced by those inputs, so there is no need to create it\r\n - the second step was greatly optimized by the observation, that when considering which nodes are incompatible for fusion with a given node `n`, if the incompatible node producing the separation set was already part of the set of nodes `n` is incompatible with, then also every node in that separation set was already included there as well. In the repro script from the issue, this change cut the number of insertion trials in the forward fusion pass from ~1M to ~2000.\r\n\r\nThe other problem fixed in this PR is that due to variable scope of `state_ptr` in `CachedOp::Forward` method, the state of `CachedOp` was taken twice for any context, resulting in 2 calls into graph optimization methods instead of 1.\r\n\r\nIn my local environment, the time spent on fusion pass in the repro script came down from over 200s to 4.5s on a single GPU.\r\n\r\n@leezu @zburning @Caenorst @samskalicky FYI \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n###

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nPorting the changes in #16914 \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

Description ##\r\nOpenMP offloading was introduced some time during the past two years and is\r\nenabled by default. With upgrading 3rdparty/openmp in\r\n#17012 it was unintentionally made part of the MXNet CMake build.\r\n\r\nBut we don't use OpenMP offloading and the Cuda target in the llvm OpenMP\r\nOffloading build is broken in our setting. Thus disable it.\r\n\r\nDue to bug in CMake < 3.13, this requires updating to CMake 3.13.

Description ##\r\nNumpy operator All/Any\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If

Description ##\r\nThe initial custom operator support provides all possible inputs to backward operators: inputs, outputs, and gradients. The user is responsible for compute the correct number of inputs and outputs, and the abstraction logic tells MXNet that the backward operator will have the correct number of inputs.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the problem where we dont account for the number of gradients in computing the number of inputs for a backward operator. Previously we computed: \"num_inputs + num_outputs\", but the correct computation should be: \"num_inputs + 2*num_outputs\" since there is an input gradient for each output argument of the forward operator. \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Description ##\r\nThis fix is to make parameter names of estimator api consistent. Previously, we have `val_metrics`, `eval_net` and `evaluation_loss` refer to the metrics, model and loss used during validation. To make the names consistent, we change these names to `val_metrics`, `val_net` and `val_loss`. So every parameter shares a common prefix of `val_` for validation.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes a number of backward operators that advertise the wrong number of inputs (either by having a wrong number passed to `set_num_inputs` or leaving it empty which defaults to 1 input). It also introduces a check in `MakeNode` to catch this error.\r\n\r\nHaving consistent number of inputs and outputs is important because tools like `Monitor` rely on them (and currently some of the networks are impossible to inspect during backward because of this) and they are needed for more advanced manipulation of the computational graph.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials

Description ##\r\nAdd a new build flag `USE_X86_ARCH` for CPU build, so users can leverage advanced x86 instructions when build mxnet from source code. Previously, only sse3 is supported.\r\n\r\nThe new flag is OFF by default.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note

Description ##\r\nEnable _GLIBCXX_ASSERTIONS when MXNet is build with DEV=1.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this

Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at https://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [X ] To the best of my knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n\r\n* When forking, sometimes mxnet can hook its fork handler before openmp's, depending upon static startup order as well as variables such as whether OMP_NUM_THREADS is set.  This is mitigated by forcing an OMP call before mxnet hooks a fork handler as well as first-thing after forking as the child.  This avoids two scenarios:\r\n  1) An OMP API call by mxnet before openmp's child fork handler has run, reinitializing its state to the new process\r\n  2) Starting a thread which may call an OpenMP API call (or open a parallel region) before or **during** OMP library's child fork handler.\r\n\r\n* A considerable amount of multithreading is done by mxnext both during static init as ell as in atfork() handlers, and we may wish to change this over time.  Due to the non-deterministic startup order of static init (and thus sometimes fork handling), it can cause unpredictable results.\r\n\r\n* Build omp in release mode to stop harmless assert.
