What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR adds a new method df.explainString() which produces the same output as df.explain() but instead of printing it returns the output as String. This output then can be manipupated easily by users and saved to external drives. \r\n\r\nThis is frequently needed feature for performance optimization purposes. Users often want to look into this output in running systems and so would like to save/extract this output from running systems (with some settings toggle) for later analysis.\r\n\r\nCurrent API only provided for Scala i.e. \r\n\r\n`df.queryExecution.toString()`\r\n\r\nand also not located in intuitive place where average Spark user (i.e. non Expert/Scala dev) can see it immediately.\r\n\r\nFor Python there are various workaround provided in Stackoverflow pages most of which suggesting to use internal Spark APIs e.g.: \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/54124386/capturing-the-result-of-explain-in-pyspark\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I see most ofthen Python users just capturing std output as below which is another workaround and not first choice for regular Spark/Pyhton users.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith io.StringIO() as buf ...`:\r\n    df.explain(True)\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nSo, it would help users a lot to have this output avalilable as:\r\n\r\n`df.explainString()`\r\n\r\ni.e. next to\r\n\r\n`df.explain()`\r\n\r\nso users can easily locate it and use.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo help users

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr upgrade Apache Arrow from 13.0.0 to 14.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe Apache Arrow 14.0.0 release brings a number of enhancements and bug fixes.\r\n‎\r\nIn terms of bug fixes, the release addresses several critical issues that were causing failures in integration jobs with Spark([GH-36332](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36332)) and problems with importing empty data arrays([GH-37056](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37056)). It also optimizes the process of appending variable length vectors([GH-37829](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37829)) and includes C++ libraries for MacOS AARCH 64 in Java-Jars([GH-38076](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/38076)).\r\n‎\r\nThe new features and improvements focus on enhancing the handling and manipulation of data. This includes the introduction of DefaultVectorComparators for large types([GH-25659](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/25659)), support for extended expressions in ScannerBuilder([GH-34252](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/34252)), and the exposure of the VectorAppender class([GH-37246](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37246)). \r\n‎\r\nThe release also brings enhancements to the development and testing process, with the CI environment now using JDK 21([GH-36994](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/36994)). In addition, the release introduces vector validation consistent with C++, ensuring consistency across different languages([GH-37702](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37702)).\r\n‎\r\nFurthermore, the usability of VarChar writers and binary writers has been improved with the addition of extra input methods([GH-37705](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37705)), and VarCharWriter now supports writing from `Text` and `String`([GH-37706](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37706)). The release also adds typed getters for StructVector, improving the ease of accessing data([GH-37863](https://github.com/apache/arrow/issues/37863)).\r\n\r\nThe full release notes as follows:\r\n- https://arrow.apache.org/release/14.0.0.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

Generalize this to propagate all thread locals, and also make a deep copy, just like the scala equivalent does a clone.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nGeneralize the mechanism of SparkConnectClient.thread_local\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nExisting test for propagating SparkSession tags

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nAdds an extra catch of `WebApplicationException` in Spark core and history server's web page servlet, to let customized response to pass-through instead of wrapping them in a 500 response, to make web page and REST API have consistent behavior.\r\n\r\nAfter the change, when a `WebApplicationException` is thrown, servlet will render a basic Spark page with the exception message, and respond with the status code of the exception.\r\n\r\nFor example, previously when a customized 418 exception is thrown, the response will be a 500 like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/10705175/2782a83a-5fd3-43a1-847b-7c001ba368bb)\r\n\r\nAfter the change, a 418 response will be rendered like this:\r\n![after](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/10705175/d9fc45c3-cbf7-454e-980f-40796d993cd8)\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nCurrently for web page servlet in Spark, when an exception is thrown, there's only 3 possible responses:\r\n- If it is history server unable to find an app, a 404 will be responded.\r\n- It the exception is an `IllegalArgumentException`, a 400 will be responded.\r\n- Otherwise, a 500 will be responded, wrapping the original exception within it.\r\n\r\nHowever for REST API, if a response is a `WebApplicationException`, its response can be directly returned with the designed status code and message, without being wrapped. This causes inconsistent behavior between web page and REST API.\r\n\r\nFor history server, Spark allows to use alternative `ApplicationHistoryProvider`, or adds extra page and API through \"AppHistoryServerPlugin\". Suppose some extra provider or plugins is used, and in some cases they want to return a special status code due to their needs. Currently there's no way to do it other than forking Spark because web page servlet does not support it.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nBy default, no. Because Spark UI's built-in web page servlet does not throw `WebApplicationException`.\r\n\r\nFor 3rd party provider or plugin, if a `WebApplicationException` is thrown, after this change, its message and status code can be directly responded. Previously it is wrapped within a 500 response.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n- 3 UTs are added:\r\n  - Testing whether history server servlet can handle `WebApplicationException`\r\n  - Testing whether servlet created by `JettyUtils` can handle `WebApplicationException`\r\n  - Testing whether servlet created by `JettyUtils` can handle other exceptions as before\r\n- Manually tested\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-03T05:06:56Z","updated_at":"2024-03-18T00:19:24Z","closed_at":"2024-03-18T00:19:24Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9dc2946b63b21d9039985faa37dc20822c49f626","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to support a new configuration `spark.master.ui.historyServerUrl` to show a new link, **Application History UI**, from `Application Page` to `Spark History Server` in `Spark Standalone Cluster`s.\r\n\r\nThis is useful when `spark.eventLog.enabled=true` and `Spark History Server` exists. A user can launch `Spark Master` with `spark.master.ui.historyServerUrl` configuration to link to it.\r\n\r\nPlease note that `Spark History Server` is an orthogonal service from not only `Spark Master` but also `Spark Applications`. For example, `Spark Application`s know only `spark.eventLog.dir`, not SHS info. Moreover, you can launch multiple SHS based on the same event location with load balancer. Lastly, SHS can be behind proxy layer too. So, only the users know the exposed SHS URL.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n**Application Detail UI**\r\n\r\nApache Spark `Master` currently shows `Application Detail UI` link for only live Spark jobs.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"436\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 8 30 20 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/9700541/28e6398c-3bb5-4f8c-9713-3a95c451759e\">\r\n\r\n**Application History UI**\r\nThis PR adds `Application History UI` link for completed jobs as the best effort when `spark.ui.historyServerUrl` is given.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"513\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 8

default.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass the CIs with the newly added test suite.\r\n\r\nAlso, manual procedure \r\n```\r\n$

tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-03T03:27:32Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T23:04:06Z","closed_at":"2023-11-03T15:17:42Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"14fab1245e7c9034c2daa347caf045df48ad002a","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406605079,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjA1MDc5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/WEB%20UI","name":"WEB

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nFix the deprecated behavior below: \r\n`Passing an explicit array value to a Scala varargs method is deprecated (since 2.13.0) and will result in a defensive copy; Use the more efficient non-copying ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray or an explicit toIndexedSeq call`\r\n\r\nFor all the use cases, we don't need to make a copy of the array. Explicitly use `ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` to do the conversion.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nEliminate compile warnings and no longer use deprecated scala APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GA.\r\nFixed all the warning with build: `mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pspark-ganglia-lgpl -Pkinesis-asl -Pdocker-integration-tests -Pyarn -Pkubernetes -Pkubernetes-integration-tests -Phive-thriftserver -Phadoop-cloud`\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThe implementation of the `mmutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray` function is as follows:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  def unsafeWrapArray[T](x: Array[T]): ArraySeq[T] = ((x: @unchecked) match {\r\n    case null              => null\r\n    case x: Array[AnyRef]  => new ofRef[AnyRef](x)\r\n    case x: Array[Int]     => new ofInt(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Double]  => new ofDouble(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Long]    => new ofLong(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Float]   => new ofFloat(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Char]    => new ofChar(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Byte]    => new ofByte(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Short]   => new ofShort(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Boolean] => new ofBoolean(x)\r\n    case x: Array[Unit]    => new ofUnit(x)\r\n  }).asInstanceOf[ArraySeq[T]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first case of match is null, there is no need to do another manual null check, so this PR removes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nRemove unnecessary null check from `ArrayImplicits.SparkArrayOps#toImmutableArraySeq`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExisting test cases, such as `ArrayImplicitsSuite`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-11-03T00:29:24Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T15:20:13Z","closed_at":"2023-11-03T08:06:39Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"99447321e1616f1ade58d569ac84c348c2d0cb54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43641/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43641/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43641/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/fea1edbe554054fcd03b111770c8470341d70d72","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-45742-FOLLOWUP","ref":"SPARK-45742-FOLLOWUP","sha":"fea1edbe554054fcd03b111770c8470341d70d72","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\n( 🚧 This PR is WIP, but I'm opening it early in the hopes of gathering early feedback)\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the Spark UI's job details page so that it shows information for all stage attempts, rather than only showing the latest attempt. \r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis makes it easier to debug jobs that were slow due to repeated stage failures.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes: it alters the Job Details page in the Spark UI.\r\n\r\nPreviously, only the latest stage attempt would be shown. If a stage failed and then subsequently succeeded then then only the last successful attempt would be shown in the tables and in the timeline view.\r\n\r\nAfter my PR's changes, all stage attempts (that the UI still knows about) are shown:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/50748/90abb73a-c8f0-41fc-98ba-71de2300b349)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\n🚧

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to enable `spark.eventLog.rolling.enabled` by default for Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.0.0, we have been using event log rolling not only for **long-running jobs**, but also for **some failed jobs** to archive the partial event logs incrementally.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/25670\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\n- No because `spark.eventLog.enabled` is disabled by default.\r\n- For the users with `spark.eventLog.enabled=true`, yes, `spark-events` directory will have different layouts. However, all 3.3+ `Spark History Server` can read both old and new event logs. I believe that the event log users are already using this configuration to avoid the loss of event logs for long-running jobs and some failed jobs.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nPass

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make `faulthandler` as a runtime configuration so we can turn on and off during runtime.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\n`faulthandler` feature within PySpark is really useful especially to debug an errors that regular Python interpreter cannot catch out of the box such as a segmentation fault errors, see also https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43600. It would be very useful to convert this as a runtime configuration without restarting the shell.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, users can now set `spark.sql.execution.pyspark.udf.faulthandler.enabled` during runtime to enable `faulthandler` feature.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nUnittest added\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo.","created_at":"2023-11-02T07:17:54Z","updated_at":"2024-01-15T00:47:53Z","closed_at":"2023-11-03T00:33:19Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"562929466f13a3971fddae31b66ad2d30133b320","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43635/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43635/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43635/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/6840197d435324aa88b3f1c55b84607ad89c4a22","head":{"label":"HyukjinKwon:runtime-conf","ref":"runtime-conf","sha":"6840197d435324aa88b3f1c55b84607ad89c4a22","user":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":42300713,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0MjMwMDcxMw==","name":"spark","full_name":"HyukjinKwon/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"HyukjinKwon","id":6477701,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0Nzc3MDE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6477701?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon","html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/HyukjinKwon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/HyukjinKwon/spark","description":"Mirror

After https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/22339, this class `TimeStampedHashMap` is only being used in UT `TimeStampedHashMapSuite`. \r\nSo, after Spark 3.0, this data structure has not been used by

for sending a pull request!  Here are some tips for you:\r\n  1. If this is your first time, please read our contributor guidelines: https://spark.apache.org/contributing.html\r\n  2. Ensure you have added or run the appropriate tests for your PR: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html\r\n  3. If the PR is unfinished, add '[WIP]' in your PR title, e.g., '[WIP][SPARK-XXXX] Your PR title ...'.\r\n  4. Be sure to keep the PR description updated to reflect all changes.\r\n  5. Please write your PR title to summarize what this PR proposes.\r\n  6. If possible, provide a concise example to reproduce the issue for a faster review.\r\n  7. If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAlso update partition statistics (e.g., total size in bytes, row count) with `ANALYZE TABLE` command.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently when a `ANALYZE TABLE <tableName>` command is triggered against a partition table, only table stats are updated, but not partition stats. For Spark users who want to update the latter, they have to use a different syntax: `ANALYZE TABLE <tableName> PARTITION(<partitionColumns>)` which is more verbose. \r\n\r\nGiven `ANALYZE TABLE` internally already calculates total size for all the partitions, it makes sense to also update partition stats using the result. In this way, Spark users do not need to remember two different syntaxes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when using `ANALYZE TABLE` with the \"scan node\", i.e., `NOSCAN` is NOT specified, we can also calculate row count for all the partitions and update the stats accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe above behavior is controlled via a new flag `spark.sql.statistics.updatePartitionStatsInAnalyzeTable.enabled`, which by default is turned off.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNot by default. When `spark.sql.statistics.updatePartitionStatsInAnalyzeTable.enabled`, Spark will now update partition stats as well with `ANALYZE TABLE` command, on a partitioned table.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test for this feature.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to improve `MasterPage` to show `Resource` column only when it exists.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nFor non-GPU

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nAs reported here https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-45762, `ShuffleManager` instances defined in a user jar cannot be used in all cases, unless specified in the `extraClassPath`. We would like to avoid adding extra configurations if this instance is already included in a jar passed via `--jars`.\r\n\r\nProposed changes:\r\n\r\nRefactor code so we initialize the `ShuffleManager` later, after jars have been localized. This is especially necessary in the executor, where we would need to move this initialization until after the `replClassLoader` is updated with jars passed in `--jars`.\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the `ShuffleManager` is instantiated at `SparkEnv` creation. Having to instantiate the `ShuffleManager` this early doesn't work, because user jars have not been localized in all scenarios, and we will fail to load the `ShuffleManager` defined in `--jars`. We propose moving the `ShuffleManager` instantiation to `SparkContext` on the driver, and `Executor`.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThis is not a new API but a change of startup order. The changed are needed to improve the user experience for the user by reducing extra configurations depending on how a spark application is launched.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, but it's backwards compatible. Users no longer need to specify a `ShuffleManager` jar in `extraClassPath`, but they are able to if they desire.\r\n\r\nThis change is not binary compatible with Spark 3.5.0 (see MIMA comments below). I have added a rule to MimaExcludes to handle it https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43627/commits/970bff4edc6ba14d8de78aa175415e204d6a627b\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nAdded a unit test showing that a test `ShuffleManager` is available after `--jars` are passed, but not without (using local-cluster mode). \r\n\r\nTested manually with standalone mode, local-cluster mode, yarn client and cluster mode, k8s.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

If you want to add a new configuration, please read the guideline first for naming configurations in\r\n     'core/src/main/scala/org/apache/spark/internal/config/ConfigEntry.scala'.\r\n  8. If you want to add or modify an error type or message, please read the guideline first in\r\n     'core/src/main/resources/error/README.md'.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify what changes you are proposing. The purpose of this section is to outline the changes and how this PR fixes the issue. \r\nIf possible, please consider writing useful notes for better and faster reviews in your PR. See the examples below.\r\n  1. If you refactor some codes with changing classes, showing the class hierarchy will help reviewers.\r\n  2. If you fix some SQL features, you can provide some references of other DBMSes.\r\n  3. If there is design documentation, please add the link.\r\n  4. If there is a discussion in the mailing list, please add the link.\r\n-->\r\nSometimes we need to duplicate expressions when rewriting the plan. It's OK for small query, as codegen has common-subexpression-elimination (CSE) to avoid evaluating the same expression. However, when the query is big, duplicating expressions can lead to a very big expression tree and make catalyst rules very slow, or even OOM when updating a leaf node (need to copy all tree nodes).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new expression to do expression-level CTE: it adds a Project to pre-evaluate the common expressions, so that they appear only once on the query plan tree, and are evaluated only once. `NullIf` now uses this new expression to avoid duplicating the `left` child expression.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nmake catalyst more efficient.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here.

Here are specific modifications：\r\na. Add stageID info to TaskDescription.\r\nb. Add taskBinary info to taskSet. Remove taskBinary info to ShuffleMapTask and ResultTask.\r\nc. add binary getter/setter of Task. Get binary will create a new copy of binary, do not use same binary of executor.\r\nd. Store binary broadcast when submitTasks.\r\ne. Add new Netty event message LaunchBinary, before executor run task, launch binary to new executor first.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n<!--\r\nPlease clarify why the changes are needed. For instance,\r\n  1. If you propose a new API, clarify the use case for a new API.\r\n  2. If you fix a bug, you can clarify why it is a bug.\r\n-->\r\nthe taskBinary for each task of the same stage is the same. The current situation is that each task will bring a copy of the taskBinary's broadcast variables to the executor, and my modification will send this taskBinary to each executor that has executed the corresponding stage, reducing the repetition of broadcast variables and avoid deserializing binary multiple times.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nBecause this modification is a modification of the Spark Core, and it also involves some parameter changes for unit testing, so I conducted all unit testing on all modules base on master branch.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `Dataset.isEmpty()` to execute global limit 1 first. `LimitPushDown` may push down global limit 1 to lower nodes to improve query performance.\r\n\r\nNote that we use global limit 1 here, because the local limit cannot be pushed down the group only case:

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to fix an UI regression at Apache Spark 3.2.0 caused by SPARK-34123.\r\n\r\nFrom Apache Spark **3.2.0** to **3.5.0**, `Spark History Server` cannot sort `Duration` column.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, Spark History Server can sort `Duration` column properly like Apache Spark 3.1.3 and before.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBefore SPARK-34123, Apache Spark had the `title` attribute for sorting.\r\n- https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/31191\r\n```\r\n<td><span title=\"{{durationMillisec}}\">{{duration}}</span></td>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout `title`, `title-numeric` doesn't work.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo. This is a bug fix.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManual test. Please use `Safari Private Browsing ` or `Chrome Incognito` mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"96\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-10-31 at 5 47 34 PM\"

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR adds checks to return specific error messages if any Python UDTF `analyze` or `eval` method accepts or returns wrong values.\r\n\r\nError messages improved include:\r\n* If the `__init__` method takes more arguments than `self` and `analyze_result`.\r\n* If the UDTF call passes more or fewer arguments than `analyze` or `eval` expects (not using `*args` or `**kwargs`).\r\n* If the `analyze` method returns an object besides a `StructType` in the `AnalyzeResult`  `schema` field.\r\n* If there are extra optional `AnalyzeResult` fields relating to input table arguments (e.g. `with_single_partition`) but the `analyze` method received no input table argument.\r\n* If the `analyze` method tries to return a list of strings for the `partition_by` optional field of the `AnalyzeResult` instead of a list of `PartitioningColumn` objects.\r\n* If the `AnalyzeResult` is missing the `schema` argument entirely.\r\n* If we use keyword arguments in the TVF call but the `analyze` or `eval` method does not accept arguments with those keyword(s) (or `**kwargs`).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThis helps

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to switch `spark.history.store.serializer` to use `PROTOBUF` by default in Apache Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nSince Apache Spark 3.4.0, we has been supporting `PROTOBUF` which is faster and compact. In addition, Apache Spark 3.3.0 is going to reach the End-Of-Support on 2023-12-15. It means every supported Apache Spark releases have `PROTOBUF` features at the time when Apache Spark 4.0.0 is released.

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, we need to use `immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray(array)` to wrap an Array into an `immutable.ArraySeq`, which makes the code look bloated.\r\n\r\nSo this PR introduces an implicit function `toImmutableArraySeq` to make it easier for Scala Array to be wrapped into `immutable.ArraySeq`.\r\n\r\nAfter this pr, we can use the following way to wrap an array into an `immutable.ArraySeq`:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\nimport org.apache.spark.util.ArrayImplicits._\r\n\r\nval dataArray = ...\r\nval immutableArraySeq = dataArray.toImmutableArraySeq\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the same time, this pr replaces the existing use of `immutable.ArraySeq.unsafeWrapArray(array)` with the new method. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this implicit function will be conducive to the progress of work SPARK-45686 and SPARK-45687.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nMakes the code for wrapping a Scala Array into an `immutable.ArraySeq` look less bloated.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-10-31T18:51:22Z","updated_at":"2023-11-02T05:04:41Z","closed_at":"2023-11-02T04:08:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"32c2d52e81573eede0108bde9853d8291404e787","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1405803268,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1ODAzMjY4","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/MLLIB","name":"MLLIB","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1982260031,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgyMjYwMDMx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/PYTHON","name":"PYTHON","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43607/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43607/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43607/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/0ee7fea6025565fdfe99dd3ed230a3482b5774e2","head":{"label":"LuciferYang:SPARK-45742","ref":"SPARK-45742","sha":"0ee7fea6025565fdfe99dd3ed230a3482b5774e2","user":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":104327447,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDQzMjc0NDc=","name":"spark","full_name":"LuciferYang/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"LuciferYang","id":1475305,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0NzUzMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1475305?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang","html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/LuciferYang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/LuciferYang/spark","description":"Mirror

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nFix issue [spark-45738](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/issues/SPARK-45738?filter=reportedbyme)\r\n\r\nMake `ExecuteEventsManager` more gracefully assert status in `SessionEventsManager`, don't throw exception when handling `Finished/Failed/Cancelled/Closed` events if status in SessionEventsManager is `Closed`. So ExecuteThreadRunner has chance to  response error to client when session is evicted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nI inspected spark sever session manager codes, and found that this bug is caused by ExecuteEventsManager and SessionEventsManager status conflict.\r\n\r\nWhen a session is `evicted`(SessionHolder.scala#L170), the status in SessionEventsManager(SessionEventsManager.scala#L72) will be changed to `Closed`, and the query within this session is cancelled. At the same time, the thread running the evicted session will throw exception(ExecuteThreadRunner.scala#L111) which is handled by ErrorUtils.handleError(ErrorUtils.scala#L211). However, this `handleError` will post failed or canceled event to ExecuteEventsManager(ErrorUtils.scala#L258), which will check the status of session in SessionEventsManager. If the status is `Closed`, it will throw exception. And **no chance to send error response**(ErrorUtils.scala#L265) to client, then the client wait forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually test. After this patch, the client will receive error when its session is evicted, as this image shows.\r\n\r\n![after_pr](https://github.com/apache/spark/assets/24190835/24558b75-a133-4f21-be1c-baaeb0ad6082)\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-31T11:43:30Z","updated_at":"2023-11-06T01:21:12Z","closed_at":"2023-11-06T01:21:12Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"e6bc2baea1766471214c1f7836c6950c7a152a1b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1405794576,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA1Nzk0NTc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/SQL","name":"SQL","color":"E99695","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4556440342,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAQXtWs8AAAABD5XDFg","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CONNECT","name":"CONNECT","color":"1D76DB","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43601/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43601/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43601/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/98893c0f183440a40a90fe845444d8bc729e3f08","head":{"label":"xieshuaihu:spark-45738","ref":"spark-45738","sha":"98893c0f183440a40a90fe845444d8bc729e3f08","user":{"login":"xieshuaihu","id":24190835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTkwODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24190835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu","html_url":"https://github.com/xieshuaihu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":702868509,"node_id":"R_kgDOKeTsHQ","name":"spark","full_name":"xieshuaihu/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"xieshuaihu","id":24190835,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI0MTkwODM1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24190835?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu","html_url":"https://github.com/xieshuaihu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/xieshuaihu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/xieshuaihu/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR improves `spark.python.worker.faulthandler.enabled` feature by catching `IOException` instead of `EOFException` (narrower).\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nExceptions such as `java.net.SocketException: Connection reset` can happen because the worker unexpectedly die. We should better catch all IO exception there.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nYes, but only in special cases. When the worker dies unexpectedly during its initialization, this can happen.\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nI tested this with Spark Connect:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cat <<EOT >> malformed_daemon.py\r\nimport ctypes\r\n\r\nfrom pyspark import daemon\r\nfrom pyspark import TaskContext\r\n\r\n\r\ndef raise_segfault():\r\n    ctypes.string_at(0)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Throw a segmentation fault during init.\r\nTaskContext._getOrCreate = raise_segfault\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == '__main__':\r\n    daemon.manager()\r\nEOT\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n./sbin/start-connect-server.sh --conf spark.python.daemon.module=malformed_daemon --conf spark.python.worker.faulthandler.enabled=true --jars `ls connector/connect/server/target/**/spark-connect*SNAPSHOT.jar`\r\n```\r\n```bash\r\n./bin/pyspark --remote \"sc://localhost:15002\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nImprove a few timing related constraints:\r\n\r\n* Wait 10s instead of 5 for a reload to happen when under high load. This should not delay the test in the average case as it checks every 100ms for an event to happen.\r\n* In certain cases we run *too fast* so the new file we create has the same timestamp as the old file, and thus we never reload. Add a sleep there so the modification times are different. This was accidentally reverted in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43249/commits/b7dac1f96ec45a300963e4da1dc4fc1173470da7#diff-de96db6b61e9f48fb9bd8b781f4367e60a48b3886dfe03d4cf16b47ef6c26d0a\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nThese changes are needed to make the test more reliable and less flaky under load.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nRan this test in parallel on a machine under high load. Previously under those conditions I would repeatedly get high rates of failure (80%+) and now it does not fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n","created_at":"2023-10-31T04:30:28Z","updated_at":"2023-11-03T05:09:58Z","closed_at":"2023-11-03T05:09:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"3a7b994af4b3fa7c2baba3723f7e021d3e903a66","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1981527456,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTgxNTI3NDU2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/CORE","name":"CORE","color":"0E8A16","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43596/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43596/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43596/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/f13b3f3ea2d982faae27579d48b16b29c455c878","head":{"label":"hasnain-db:fix-flaky-test","ref":"fix-flaky-test","sha":"f13b3f3ea2d982faae27579d48b16b29c455c878","user":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":677479521,"node_id":"R_kgDOKGGEYQ","name":"spark","full_name":"hasnain-db/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"hasnain-db","id":122326278,"node_id":"U_kgDOB0qNBg","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/122326278?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db","html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hasnain-db/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/hasnain-db/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis pr upgrade commons-io from 2.14.0 to 2.15.0\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nThe updates of `commons-io` 2.15.0 mainly focus on fixing bugs in file and stream handling, adding new file and stream handling features, and optimizing the performance of file content comparison:\r\n\r\n1. Bug fixes: This version fixes multiple bugs, mainly in file and stream handling. For example, it fixes the encoding matching issue of `XmlStreamReader` (IO-810), the issue that `FileUtils.listFiles` and `FileUtils.iterateFiles` methods failed to close their internal streams (IO-811), and the issue that `StreamIterator` failed to close its internal stream (IO-811). In addition, it also fixes the null pointer exception information of `RandomAccessFileMode.create(Path)`, and the issue that `UnsynchronizedBufferedInputStream.read(byte[], int, int)` does not use the buffer (IO-816).\r\n\r\n2. New features: This version adds some new classes and methods, such as `org.apache.commons.io.channels.FileChannels`, `RandomAccessFiles#contentEquals(RandomAccessFile, RandomAccessFile)`, `RandomAccessFiles#reset(RandomAccessFile)`, and `org.apache.commons.io.StreamIterator`. In addition, it also added `MessageDigestInputStream` and deprecated `MessageDigestCalculatingInputStream`.\r\n\r\n3. Performance optimization: This version optimizes the performance of `PathUtils.fileContentEquals(Path, Path, LinkOption[], OpenOption[])`, `PathUtils.fileContentEquals(Path, Path)`, and `FileUtils.contentEquals(File, File)`. From the release notes, the related performance has improved by about 60%.\r\n\r\nThe full release notes as follow:\r\n\r\n- https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/changes-report.html#a2.15.0\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nSupport multiple retry policies defined at the same time. Each policy determines which error types it can retry and how exactly those should be spread out.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nDifferent error types should be treated differently For instance, networking connectivity errors and remote resources being initialized should be treated separately.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo (as long as user doesn't poke within client internals).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nUnit tests, some hand testing.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/spark/pull/42627 set a character length limit for the error message and a stack depth limit for error stack traces to the

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR fixed the issues corresponding to the compile suppression rules added in SPARK-35496 for upgrading to Scala 2.13.7, and cleaned up these rules.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// SPARK-35496 Upgrade Scala to 2.13.7 and suppress:\r\n// 1. `The outer reference in this type test cannot be checked at run time`\r\n// 2. `the type test for pattern TypeA cannot be checked at runtime because it\r\n//    has type parameters eliminated by erasure`\r\n// 3. `abstract type TypeA in type pattern Seq[TypeA] (the underlying of\r\n//    Seq[TypeA]) is unchecked since it is eliminated by erasure`\r\n// 4. `fruitless type test: a value of TypeA cannot also be a TypeB`\r\n\"-Wconf:cat=unchecked&msg=outer reference:s\",\r\n\"-Wconf:cat=unchecked&msg=eliminated by erasure:s\",\r\n\"-Wconf:msg=^(?=.*?a value of type)(?=.*?cannot also be).+$:s\",\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe specific fixes are as follows:\r\n- Added the corresponding `outer reference` to fix issue 1\r\n- Used fine-grained `@unchecked` declarations to clean up issues 2 and 3\r\n- Since the case corresponding to issue 4 no longer exists, the corresponding suppression rule was directly deleted.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nClean up the compile issue suppression rules added in SPARK-35496 for upgrading to Scala 2.13.7.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nPass GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to remove remaining deprecated Pandas features from Spark 3.4.0\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nTo match the behavior of Pandas. We cleaned up most of APIs, but there are still some features that deprecated from Spark 3.4.0 need to be removed.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n<!--\r\nNote that it means *any* user-facing change including all aspects such as the documentation fix.\r\nIf yes, please clarify the previous behavior and the change this PR proposes - provide the console output, description and/or an example to show the behavior difference if possible.\r\nIf possible, please also clarify if this is a user-facing change compared to the released Spark versions or within the unreleased branches such as master.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\n-->\r\nYes, some parameters and APIs are removed from Spark 4.0.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n<!--\r\nIf tests were added, say they were added here. Please make sure to add some test cases that check the changes thoroughly including negative and positive cases if possible.\r\nIf it was tested in a way different from regular unit tests, please clarify how you tested step by step, ideally copy and paste-able, so that other reviewers can test and check, and descendants can verify in the future.\r\nIf tests were not added, please describe why they were not added and/or why it was difficult to add.\r\nIf benchmark tests were added, please run the benchmarks in GitHub Actions for the consistent environment, and the instructions could accord to: https://spark.apache.org/developer-tools.html#github-workflow-benchmarks.\r\n-->\r\nThe existing CI should pass.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\n<!--\r\nIf generative AI tooling has been used in the process of authoring this patch, please include the\r\nphrase: 'Generated-by: ' followed by the name of the tool and its version.\r\nIf no, write 'No'.\r\nPlease refer to the [ASF Generative Tooling Guidance](https://www.apache.org/legal/generative-tooling.html) for

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nThis PR are removing `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_21[59,60,61,62]` and `TOO_MANY_ARRAY_ELEMENTS`:\r\n1. `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2159` is used in concat/array_insert;\r\n2. `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2160` is only used in flatten;\r\n3. `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2161` is used in array_repeat/array_insert/array_distinct/array_union/array_intersect/array_remove;\r\n4. `_LEGACY_ERROR_TEMP_2162` is used in array_union/array_distinct;\r\n5. There is another similar error class `TOO_MANY_ARRAY_ELEMENTS` which are used in `UnsafeArrayWriter.java`.\r\n\r\nI removed these 5 similar error classes and create a new error class `COLLECTION_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` with 3 sub-classes:\r\n1. `PARAMETER` is used when the parameter exceed size limit, such as `array_repeat` with count too large;\r\n6. `FUNCTION` is used when trying to create an array exceeding size limit in a function, for example, flatten 2 arrays to a larger array;\r\n7. `INITIALIZE` is used in `UnsafeArrayWriter.java` when trying to initialize an array exceeding size limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nTo assign proper name as a part of activity in SPARK-37935.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nYes, the error message will include the error class name.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n1. `COLLECTION_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED.PARAMETER` can be tested from use code;\r\n2.  `COLLECTION_SIZE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED.FUNCTION` is tested using a `ColumnarArray` in `concat/flatten`, but can't be tested in `array_insert/array_distinct/array_union/array_intersect/array_remove` since we need to deduplicate the data and create an array which will cause OOM.\r\n3. `INITIALIZE` is already tested in a existing case.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nCurrently, Spark supported all the avro compression codecs, but the avro supported compression codecs and spark supported are not completely one-on-one due to Spark introduce the compression codecs `UNCOMPRESSED`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a lot of magic strings copy from avro compression codecs. This issue lead to developers need to manually maintain its consistency. It is easy to make mistakes and reduce development efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nLet developers easy to use avro compression codecs.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\n'No'.\r\nIntroduce a new class.\r\n\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nExists test cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\nPackages are deployed after all packages have been built. Currently, individual packages are deployed once they are built.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\nWhen some package fails to build (SPARK_45651), earlier packages have been published already, leading to an inconsistent set of latest snapshots, which might cause `ClassNotFoundExceptions` like in https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/43102#issuecomment-1759541718. Packages should only be published once all have been built.\r\n\r\n### Does this PR introduce _any_ user-facing change?\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\nLocally: `./build/mvn deploy` builds all packages before it attempts to upload any.\r\n\r\n### Was this patch authored or co-authored using generative AI tooling?\r\nNo","created_at":"2023-10-27T12:04:57Z","updated_at":"2024-04-21T00:20:36Z","closed_at":"2024-04-21T00:20:36Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4ffee4cc975caa913ce34f4b4d08339e824cb74d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1406627200,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNDA2NjI3MjAw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/BUILD","name":"BUILD","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1753478521,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzUzNDc4NTIx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/labels/Stale","name":"Stale","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43561/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/43561/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/issues/43561/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/spark/statuses/12554e4fe85d87776395f3ad140bf584e753d6b4","head":{"label":"G-Research:publish-snapshot-deploy-at-end","ref":"publish-snapshot-deploy-at-end","sha":"12554e4fe85d87776395f3ad140bf584e753d6b4","user":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":214350064,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyMTQzNTAwNjQ=","name":"spark","full_name":"G-Research/spark","private":false,"owner":{"login":"G-Research","id":21341965,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjIxMzQxOTY1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21341965?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research","html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/G-Research/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/G-Research/spark","description":"Apache

What changes were proposed in this pull request?\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to make entire Binder build fails fast during setting up to prevent the Binder image to be successfully built which it cannot be rebuilt later on the same commit.\r\n\r\n### Why are the changes needed?\r\n\r\nBinder build is currently broken for Spark 3.5.0:\r\n\r\nhttps://mybinder.org/v2/gh/apache/spark/ce5ddad9903?filepath=python%2Fdocs%2Fsource%2Fgetting_started%2Fquickstart_df.ipynb\r\n\r\nSeems like we uploaded PySpark late into PyPI, and the installation steps just slightly ignored the failure (a user triggered the first docker image for Binder, and that's being reused at that time PySpark wasn't uploaded to PyPI).\r\n\r\n![Screenshot

user-facing live notebooks (at https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html).\r\n\r\n### How was this patch tested?\r\n\r\nManually tested in my fork:\r\n-
