For idle partitions (newly created or not), the lag is never updated because `validBytes > 0` is never true. As a side effect, the partition is considered out-of-sync and could be incorrectly throttled.\r\n\r\nThis patch really makes me wonder if keeping the lag in the `PartitionFetchState` is really necessary. At the end of the day, we only use is to compute `isReplicaInSync` because the metrics rely on the the `FetcherLagMetrics`. We could just maintain a boolean for this purpose. I chose the easy path in this patch.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ]

(org.apache.kafka.connect.util.clusters.EmbeddedConnectCluster:905)\r\n\r\nThe connector generates no task configurations because there are no consumer groups to distribute to the tasks, because the only consumer group available is filtered out:\r\n> [2023-06-09 21:34:39,370] DEBUG [MirrorCheckpointConnector|worker] Ignoring the following groups which do not have any offsets for topics that are accepted by the topic filter: [consumer-group-dummy] (org.apache.kafka.connect.mirror.MirrorCheckpointConnector:190)\r\n\r\nThis is because the consumer-group-dummy did not commit any offsets for any topics, and doesn't satisfy the filtering logic added in #13446 . The dummy group commits offsets in warmUpConsumer: https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/7eea2a3908fdcee1627c18827e6dcb5ed0089fdd/connect/mirror/src/test/java/org/apache/kafka/connect/mirror/integration/MirrorConnectorsIntegrationBaseTest.java#L1189-L1198\r\n\r\nIf the single invocation of poll times out before the consumer can retrieve the metadata for the partition, then the commitSync does not commit any offsets for the consumer, leaving no offsets instead of the expected offset 0. This poll duration is 500ms, which is regularly exceeded in my 30% CPU de-flaking environment.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, increase the poll timeout from 500ms to 5s, to make consumer call-sites less flaky.\r\nUnfortunately this strategy is not ideal for the warmUpConsumer function itself, which is always called on an empty topic and will always block for the whole duration, lengthening the runtime of the test.\r\nSo for warmUpConsumer, replace the empty poll() with Admin calls which retrieve the set of partitions and then commit offset 0 for all partitions.\r\n\r\n### Committer

patch uses a Github workflow to mark inactive PRs with the `stale` label. The workflow uses the [\"stale\" action](https://github.com/actions/stale) which has many features including a number of filtering options and the ability to auto-closing issues.\r\n\r\nFor this patch, I've disable auto-closing PRs and just have it add the label for PRs with more than 90 days of inactivity. \r\n\r\nI've also only included a manual trigger. We can eventually include a cron schedule for automatic nightly running of the workflow.\r\n\r\nI have tested this out on my fork of Kafka and it worked as expected: https://github.com/mumrah/kafka/actions/workflows/stale.yml\r\n\r\nHere you can see when it actually marked an old PR as stale

PR expands the scope of ApiVersionManager a bit to include returning the current MetadataVersion and features that are in effect. This is useful in general because that information needs to be returned in an ApiVersionsResponse. It also allows us to fix the ApiVersionManager interface so that all subclasses implement all methods of the interface. Having subclasses that don't implement some methods is dangerous because they could cause exceptions at runtime in unexpected scenarios.\r\n\r\nOn the KRaft controller, we were previously performing a read operation in the QuorumController thread to get the current metadata version and features. With this PR, we now read a volatile variable maintained by a separate MetadataVersionContextPublisher object. This will improve performance and simplify the code. It should not change the guarantees we are providing; in both the old and new scenarios, we need to be robust against version skew scenarios during updates.","created_at":"2023-06-07T21:42:48Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T23:47:15Z","closed_at":"2023-06-19T23:47:07Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4630fa5a50135a39739d8724ff51042b0d523aec","assignee":{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"mumrah","id":55116,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1MTE2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/55116?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah","html_url":"https://github.com/mumrah","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mumrah/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"showuon","id":43372967,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzMzcyOTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43372967?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon","html_url":"https://github.com/showuon","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/showuon/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13826/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13826/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13826/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/95d44d8746f249c3a66d6d37a2075eb0af2534b3","head":{"label":"cmccabe:cmccabe_fix_api_version_manager","ref":"cmccabe_fix_api_version_manager","sha":"95d44d8746f249c3a66d6d37a2075eb0af2534b3","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gr

order to support multiple scanning modes, we should refactor the existing scanning mechanism out of the DelegatingClassLoader. This is because KIP-898 will require more functionality that relies on the results of scanning, and it is not appropriate to add this functionality to the DCL itself.\r\n\r\nScanning (and the PluginScanResult) are dependent on the ClassLoader instances which are used to load the plugins, so the protected functions for instantiating classloaders is moved to from Plugins and DelegatingClassLoader to the new PluginClassLoaderFactor and ClassLoaderFactory classes. The setup logic that constructs PluginClassLoaders for each pluginLocation is moved to PluginUtils.pluginSources.\r\n\r\nIn addition to pulling the existing reflection-based scanning out into a ReflectionScanner and superclass PluginScanner, rename `DelegatingClassLoaderTest` to `PluginScannerTest`, because it was primarily testing the plugin scanning.\r\n\r\nThis test will be expanded in a follow-up to be parameterized, and test the ServiceLoaderScanner in similar fashion to the ReflectionScanner.\r\n\r\nTo replace DelegatingClassLoaderTest, write a new test targeting the now much smaller scope of the DelegatingClassLoader, using mocked parent and plugin classloaders, as well as mocked plugin scanning logic.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-06-06T17:27:51Z","updated_at":"2023-07-06T17:22:28Z","closed_at":"2023-07-06T17:22:28Z","merged_at":"2023-07-06T17:22:28Z","merge_commit_sha":"1b925e9ee753390d4633e8e5bd25a00af8d26cb9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13821/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13821/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13821/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5efb97ab40d381a096d7e301eec3bec9aeb8cb2b","head":{"label":"gharris1727:minor-separate-plugin-scanner","ref":"minor-separate-plugin-scanner","sha":"5efb97ab40d381a096d7e301eec3bec9aeb8cb2b","user":{"login":"gharris1727","id":5856969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTY5Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5856969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727","html_url":"https://github.com/gharris1727","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":192386443,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxOTIzODY0NDM=","name":"kafka","full_name":"gharris1727/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"gharris1727","id":5856969,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTY5Njk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5856969?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727","html_url":"https://github.com/gharris1727","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gharris1727/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/gharris1727/kafka","description":"Mirror

while researching [KAFKA-14718](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14718)\r\n\r\nCurrently, we perform a check during zombie fencing that causes the round of zombie fencing to fail when a rebalance is pending (i.e., when we've detected from a background poll of the config topic that a new connector has been created, that an existing connector has been deleted, or that a new set of connector tasks has been generated).\r\n\r\nIt's possible but not especially likely that this check causes issues when running vanilla Kafka Connect. Even when it does, it's easy enough to restart failed tasks via the REST API.\r\n\r\nHowever, when running MirrorMaker 2 in dedicated mode, this check is more likely to cause issues as we write three connector configs to the config topic in rapid succession on startup. And in that mode, there is no API to restart failed tasks aside from restarting the worker that they are hosted on.\r\n\r\nIn either case, this check can lead to test flakiness in integration tests for MirrorMaker 2 both in dedicated mode and when deployed onto a vanilla Kafka Connect cluster.\r\n\r\nThis check is not actually necessary, and we can safely remove it. Copied from Jira:\r\n\r\n> If the worker that we forward the zombie fencing request to is a zombie leader (i.e., a worker that believes it is the leader but in reality is not), it will fail to finish the round of zombie fencing because it won't be able to write to the config topic with a transactional producer.\r\n\r\n> If the connector has just been deleted, we'll still fail the request since we force a read-to-end of the config topic and refresh our snapshot of its contents before checking to see if the connector exists.\r\n\r\n> And regardless, the worker that owns the task will still do a read-to-end of the config topic and verify that (1) no new task configs have been generated for the connector and (2) the worker is still assigned the connector, before allowing the task to process any data.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, while waiting on a fix for [KAFKA-14718](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14718) that adds more granularity for diagnosing failures in the `DedicatedMirrorIntegrationTest` suite (https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13284), some of the timeouts in that test are bumped to work better on our CI infrastructure.","created_at":"2023-06-06T12:41:14Z","updated_at":"2023-06-19T10:28:02Z","closed_at":"2023-06-16T09:58:36Z","merged_at":"2023-06-16T09:58:36Z","merge_commit_sha":"e1d59920f4fed5c4bc890e53e249d3439e148bab","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":851037639,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw4NTEwMzc2Mzk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/connect","name":"connect","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1257747426,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjU3NzQ3NDI2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/tests","name":"tests","color":"cfff60","default":false,"description":"Test

Background\r\n\r\nIn Kafka's code, every batch of records is stored in an in-memory byte buffer. For compressed workload, this buffer contains data in compressed form. Before writing it to the log, Kafka performs some validations such as ensuring that offsets are monotonically increasing etc. To perform this validation, Kafka needs to uncompress the data stored in byte buffer.\r\n\r\nFor zstd compressed batches, Kafka uses ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer interface provided by the downstream zstd-jni library to perform decompression. \r\n\r\nZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer takes input an InputStream and provides output an InputStream. Since, Kafka stores the entire batch in a ByteBuffer, Kafka wraps the ByteBuffer into an InputStream to satisfy the input contract for ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer is not a good fit for our use case because we already have the entire compressed data stored in a buffer. We don't have a need for an interface which takes InputStream as an input. Our requirement is for an interface which takes a ByteBuffer as an input and provides a stream of uncompressed data as output. Prior to zstd-jni 1.5.5, no such interface existed. Hence, we were forced to use ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer.\r\n\r\nUsage of ZstdInputStreamNoFinalizer has the following problems:\r\n1. When decompression of batch is complete, we try to read another byte to check if the actual batch size if equal to declared batch size. This is done at RecordIterator#next(). This extra call to read another byte leads to a JNI call in existing interface.\r\n2. Since this interface requires input as an InputStream, we take the ByteBuffer containing compressed batch and convert it into a InputStream. This interface internally uses an intermediate buffer to read data from this InputStream in chunks. The chunk size is determined by underlying zstd library and hence, we will allocate a new buffer with very batch. This leads to the following transformation: ByteBuffer (compressed batch) -> InputStream (compressed batch) -> data copy to intermediate ByteBuffer (chunk of compressed batch) -> send chunk to zstd library for decompression -> refill the intermediate buffer by copying the data to intermediate ByteBuffer (next chunk of compressed batch)\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nI have extended an an interface in downstream library zstd-jni to suit the use case of Kafka. The new interface is called ZstdBufferDecompressingStreamNoFinalizer. It provides an interface where it takes input as a ByteBuffer containing compressed data and provides output as an InputStream. It solves the above problems as follows:\r\n1. When we read the final decompressed frame, this interface sets a flag to mark that all uncompressed data has been consumed. When RecordIterator#next() tries to determine if the stream has ended, we simply read the flag and hence, do not have to make a JNI call.\r\n2. It does not require any buffer allocation for input. It takes the input buffer and passes it across the JNI boundary without any intermediate copying. Hence, we don't perform any buffer allocation.\r\n\r\n## Result\r\n\r\n1. Improvement in method throughput 10-20% as demonstrated by microbenchmark report at https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/13058907/zstd-upgrade.xlsx . The microbenchmark uses existing benchmark at https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/trunk/jmh-benchmarks/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/jmh/record/RecordBatchIterationBenchmark.java\r\n\r\n2. Reducing in allocation of a buffer as demonstrated by unit test\r\n\r\n## References\r\n### Changes in downstream zstd-jni\r\n\r\nAdd new interface

PR fixes three issues:\r\n\r\n* `InvalidProducerEpochException` was not handled consistently. `InvalidProducerEpochException` used to be able to be return via both transactional response and produce response, but as of KIP-588 (2.7+), transactional responses should not return `InvalidProducerEpochException` anymore, only produce responses can. It can happen that older brokers may still return `InvalidProducerEpochException` for transactional responses; these must be converted to the newer `ProducerFencedException`. This conversion wasn't done for `TxnOffsetCommit` (sent to the group coordinator).\r\n\r\n* `InvalidTxnStateException` was double-wrapped in `KafkaException`, whereas other exceptions are usually wrapped only once. Furthermore, `InvalidTxnStateException` was not handled at all for in `AddOffsetsToTxn` response, where it should be a possible error as well, according to API documentation.\r\n\r\n * According to API documentation, `UNSUPPORTED_FOR_MESSAGE_FORMAT` is not possible for `TxnOffsetCommit`, but it looks like it is, and it is being handled there, so I updated the API

this test broker session timeout is configured aggressively low (to 1 second) so that fencing can happen without much waiting. Then in the final portion of the test when brokers should not be fenced heartbeats are sent roughly 2 times in a session timeout window. However the first time that's done there's other code between sending the heartbeat and taking the timestamp, and in local tests that code can take up to 0.5 seconds (1/2 of the session timeout). That then can result in all brokers being fenced again which would fail the test.\r\n\r\nThis change sends a heartbeat just when a timestamp is taken, which in local tests results flaky failures from 4 out of 50 to 0 out of 50.\r\n- In local tests increasing the session timeout from 1 second to 2 seconds also reduced the flaky failures to 0 out of 50 but also consistently increased the test running time with 1 second (which seems expected).\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build

statement described in [ticket](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15018)\r\n\r\nThis PR explicitly fails the offset flush for cases when the dual write fails on secondary store. This PR does the same thing as prescribed in the ticket to write first to secondary stores in cases of tombstone records. Also, while originally the flushes didn't care about the outcome of the writes to secondary stores, this PR fails marks the flush as failed for cases when offsets with tombstone records also don't get written successfully to secondary stores. This is because Tombstone events happening are rare events as per ticket. And the probability of them failing on secondary and succeeding on primary is even lesser than that. Considering these things, this PR errs on the side of correctness for these rare events which can lead to inconsistent state. Note that post this PR, offset flus becomes a 3 step process when tombstone offsets are present. \r\n\r\n1. Only tombstone offsets are flushed to the secondary store in a synchronous manner. \r\n2.

the active quorum controller encounters an \"unexpected\" error, such as a NullPointerException, it currently resigns its leadership. This PR fixes it so that in addition to doing that, it also increments the metadata error count metric. This will allow us to better track down these errors.\r\n\r\nThis PR also fixes a minor bug where performing read operations on a standby controller would result in an unexpected RuntimeException. The bug happened because the standby controller does not take in-memory snapshots, and read operations were attempting to read from the epoch of the latest committed offset. The fix is for the standby controller to simply read the latest value of each data structure. This is always safe, because standby controllers don't contain uncommitted data.\r\n\r\nAlso, fix a bug where listPartitionReassignments was reading the latest data, rather than data from the last committed offset.","created_at":"2023-06-02T00:00:31Z","updated_at":"2023-06-02T19:51:18Z","closed_at":"2023-06-02T19:51:15Z","merged_at":"2023-06-02T19:51:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"146a6976aed0d9f90c70b6f21dca8b887cc34e71","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13799/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13799/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13799/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/437199d2b71ec0c0f4aaa193c32b159b4322293a","head":{"label":"cmccabe:KAFKA-15048","ref":"KAFKA-15048","sha":"437199d2b71ec0c0f4aaa193c32b159b4322293a","user":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":74628042,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3NDYyODA0Mg==","name":"kafka","full_name":"cmccabe/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"cmccabe","id":1095624,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwOTU2MjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1095624?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe","html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cmccabe/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/cmccabe/kafka","description":"Mirror

JIRA\r\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14791\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis creates a builder for `PartitionRegistration`. The motivation for the builder is that the constructor of `PartitionRegistration` has four arguments all of type `int[]` which makes it easy to make a mistake when using it. Right now the constructor has the signature:\r\n```\r\npublic PartitionRegistration(int[] replicas, int[] isr, int[] removingReplicas,\r\n                             int[] addingReplicas, int leader, LeaderRecoveryState leaderRecoveryState,\r\n                             int leaderEpoch, int partitionEpoch) {\r\n```\r\nIt's easy to mix up any of `replicas`, `isr`, `removingReplicas` and `addingReplicas`. \r\n\r\nWith this change the constructor is made `protected` so only code in the same package can use it, which is helpful for unit testing. All other code must use the builder. That code might look like:\r\n```\r\npartitionRegistration = new PartitionRegistration.Builder().\r\n    setReplicas(Replicas.toArray(assignment.brokerIds())).\r\n    setIsr(Replicas.toArray(isr)).\r\n    setRemovingReplicas(removing).\r\n    setAddingReplicas(adding).\r\n    setLeader(isr.get(0)).\r\n    setLeaderRecoveryState(LeaderRecoveryState.RECOVERED).\r\n    setLeaderEpoch(0).\r\n    setPartitionEpoch(0).\r\n    build();\r\n```\r\nThis makes it less likely to make a mistake when setting any of `replicas`, `isr`, `removingReplicas` and `addingReplicas`. We also make `addingReplicas` and `removingReplicas` default to `Replicas.NONE` because usually they are empty and are only used during reassignments. \r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis updates all the unit tests to use the new builder. This also adds unit tests to `PartitionRegistrationTest` testing the builder's validation and object construction.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-31T21:01:55Z","updated_at":"2023-06-06T14:58:24Z","closed_at":"2023-06-06T14:58:24Z","merged_at":"2023-06-06T14:58:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"db9d8457027c1dfb72a33290d18e227d4a02f16d","assignee":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13788/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13788/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13788/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/5fcf4124bf706670cbe8c83bf52f4ddca41344fd","head":{"label":"andymg3:KAFKA-14791","ref":"KAFKA-14791","sha":"5fcf4124bf706670cbe8c83bf52f4ddca41344fd","user":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":475882650,"node_id":"R_kgDOHF1kmg","name":"kafka","full_name":"andymg3/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andymg3","id":97484553,"node_id":"U_kgDOBc9_CQ","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/97484553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3","html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andymg3/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andymg3/kafka","description":"Mirror

is a redo of https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13608\r\n\r\nIntroduced extra mapping to track verification state.\r\n\r\nWhen verifying, there is a race condition that the add partitions verification response returns that the partition is in the ongoing transaction, but an abort marker is written before we get to append. Therefore, we track any given transaction we are verifying with an object unique to that transaction. \r\n\r\nWe check this unique state upon the first append to the log. After that, we can rely on currentTransactionFirstOffset. We remove the verification state on appending to the log with a transactional data record or marker.\r\n\r\nWe will also clean up lingering verification state entries via the producer state entry expiration mechanism. We do not update the the timestamp on retrying a verification for a transaction, so each entry must be verified before producer.id.expiration.ms.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

version of initial change: https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/13768 in branch \"3.4\"\r\n\r\nKey difference with branched change:\r\nPassed and used existing `scheduler` which already is being used for flushing large segment logs and indices.\r\n\r\nIn all cases snapshot's fileChannel is kept opened when passed to other threads for flushing and closing (so removing try-with-resource in this change).\r\n\r\nRelated issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9693\r\n\r\nThe issue with repeating latency spikes during Kafka log segments rolling still reproduced on the latest versions including kafka_2.13-3.4.0.\r\n\r\nIt was found that flushing Kafka snapshot file during segments rolling blocks producer request handling thread for some time. Reproduced latency improvement in the kafka_2.13-3.6.0-snapshot by offloading flush operation. Used available on my side single node test configuration:\r\n kafka_2.13-3.6.0-snapshot - trunk version\r\n kafka_2.13-3.6.0-snapshot-fix - trunk version with provided change\r\n\r\nTest time

\"replace.null.with.default\" option is a KIP-581 addition that is intended to (when false) prevent the Connect default values from being emitted in the JsonConverter. The current implementation works for root values, but does not work for Structs, as the Struct::get implementation has logic to substitute the default value if no value is present.\r\n\r\nInstead, the JsonConverter should call Struct::getWithoutDefault, and hide the default value for Struct fields when \"replace.null.with.default\" is false.\r\n\r\nThis should be backported to 3.5\r\nSupersedes #13748\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-15034\r\n- The `ReplaceField` SMT can be configured with a list of fields that are to be included or excluded during every record transformation.\r\n- Currently, it uses an `ArrayList` for these fields which causes the filter operations to be of O(N) complexity resulting in poor performance when configured with a large number of include / exclude fields.\r\n- This patch refactors it to use a `HashSet` instead (O(1) expected time complexity) and adds a JMH benchmark to demonstrate the performance improvements.\r\n\r\n\r\n## JMH Benchmark Result

DelegatingClassLoader has a large number of fields and methods for keeping track of known PluginDesc objects. It has this in common with the PluginScanResult data object, which has a similar set of fields and methods. On trunk, the PluginScanResult is only used as a return value of one internal function, before it's results are accumulated by the DCL and discarded. To simplify the DCL, we should use the PluginScanResult object as a container to store and accumulate PluginDesc objects, and return it to the caller to allow them to inspect the scanned plugins without interacting with the DCL.\r\n\r\nUsing the PluginScanResult as an accumulator, we can delay writing scan results to the pluginLoaders and aliases fields until after all scanning has taken place. This is done via the new installDiscoveredPlugins method. This prevents plugins being scanned from having an inconsistent delegation path: Previously, because the accumulators were updated as scanning proceeded, plugins may or may not be able to see one another via the DelegatingClassLoader::loadClass method. Now, plugins will _not_ be able to see one another before installDiscoveredPlugins is applied and scanning is finished.\r\n\r\nThis is a first-pass refactor, before pulling the scanning logic out of the DCL to further simplify it. Once external scanning is complete, the caller will call installDiscoveredPlugins to finish initialization of the DCL.\r\n\r\nIn the trunk implementation, there is some order-sensitivity to the scanning process because of the accumulator fields. In particular: \r\n1. Because the classpath is scanned last, plugins on the classpath automatically take precedence over isolated plugins. In order to replicate this effect, PluginDesc objects now explicitly compare their isolated/non-isolated nature, and order classpath plugins first.\r\n2. The alias mechanism attempts to determine if aliases are unique, but on trunk it allows colliding aliases from different plugin types to overwrite one another. This is changed to prevent alias collisions across plugin types, now that the iteration over PluginDesc objects isn't grouped by plugin type.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit

issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-9693\r\n\r\nThe issue with repeating latency spikes during Kafka log segments rolling still reproduced on the latest versions including  kafka_2.13-3.4.0.\r\n\r\nIt was found that flushing Kafka snapshot file during segments rolling blocks producer request handling thread for some time:\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/3.4/core/src/main/scala/kafka/log/ProducerStateManager.scala#L452\r\n```\r\n  private def writeSnapshot(file: File, entries: mutable.Map[Long, ProducerStateEntry]): Unit = {\r\n...\r\n    val fileChannel = FileChannel.open(file.toPath, StandardOpenOption.CREATE, StandardOpenOption.WRITE)\r\n    try {\r\n      fileChannel.write(buffer)\r\n      fileChannel.force(true)     <- here\r\n    } finally {\r\n      fileChannel.close()\r\n    }...\r\n\r\n```\r\nMore partitions - more cumulative latency effect observed.\r\n\r\nSuggested fix offloads flush (fileChannel.force) operation to the background thread similar to (but not exactly) how it was done in the UnifiedLog.scala:\r\n```\r\n  def roll(\r\n   ...\r\n    // Schedule an asynchronous flush of the old segment\r\n    scheduler.schedule(\"flush-log\", () => flushUptoOffsetExclusive(newSegment.baseOffset))\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe benchmarking using this fix shows significant reduction in

the KRaft controller removes a replica from the ISR because of the controlled shutdown there is no need for the leader epoch to be increased by the KRaft controller. This is accurate as long as the topic partition leader doesn't add the removed replica back to the ISR.\r\n\r\nThis change also fixes a bug when computing the HWM. When computing the HWM, replicas that are not eligible to join the ISR but are caught up should not be included in the computation. Otherwise, the HWM will never increase for `replica.lag.time.max.ms` because the shutting down replica is not sending FETCH request. Without this additional fix PRODUCE requests would timeout if the request timeout is greater than `replica.lag.time.max.ms`.\r\n\r\nBecause of the bug above the KRaft controller needs to check the MV to guarantee that all brokers support this bug fix before skipping the leader epoch bump.\r\n\r\n### Committer Checklist (excluded from commit message)\r\n- [ ] Verify design and implementation \r\n- [ ] Verify test coverage and CI build status\r\n- [ ] Verify documentation (including upgrade notes)\r\n","created_at":"2023-05-25T17:28:54Z","updated_at":"2023-06-07T14:20:44Z","closed_at":"2023-06-07T14:20:41Z","merged_at":"2023-06-07T14:20:41Z","merge_commit_sha":"8ad0ed3e618ed6c101907484d6cdbaee90d3d99c","assignee":{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"dajac","id":157182,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1NzE4Mg==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/157182?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac","html_url":"https://github.com/dajac","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dajac/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"hachikuji","id":12502538,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTAyNTM4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12502538?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji","html_url":"https://github.com/hachikuji","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hachikuji/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":2650268685,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyNjUwMjY4Njg1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/labels/kraft","name":"kraft","color":"FBCA04","default":false,"description":""}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13765/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/13765/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/issues/13765/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/kafka/statuses/21fe45caec2f0e84f7931318bad02411b801a72b","head":{"label":"jsancio:kafka--15021-skip-leader-epoch-bump","ref":"kafka--15021-skip-leader-epoch-bump","sha":"21fe45caec2f0e84f7931318bad02411b801a72b","user":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/794394?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio","html_url":"https://github.com/jsancio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jsancio/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":169502372,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxNjk1MDIzNzI=","name":"kafka","full_name":"jsancio/kafka","private":false,"owner":{"login":"jsancio","id":794394,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5NDM5NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.gi

the active KRaft controller is overloaded, it will not be able to process broker heartbeat\r\nrequests. Instead, they will be timed out. When using the default configuration, this will happen\r\nif the time needed to process a broker heartbeat climbs above a second for a sustained period.\r\nThis, in turn, could lead to brokers being improperly fenced when they are still alive.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, timed out heartbeats will still update the lastContactNs and metadataOffset of the\r\nbroker in the BrokerHeartbeatManager. While we don't generate any records, this should still be\r\nadequate to prevent spurious fencing. We also log a message at ERROR level so that this condition\r\nwill be more obvious.\r\n\r\nOther small changes in this PR: fix grammar issue in log4j of BrokerHeartbeatManager. Add JavaDoc\r\nfor ClusterControlManager#zkMigrationEnabled field. Add builder for ReplicationControlTestContext\r\nto avoid having tons of constructors. Update ClusterControlManager.DEFAULT_SESSION_TIMEOUT_NS to\r\nmatch the default in
