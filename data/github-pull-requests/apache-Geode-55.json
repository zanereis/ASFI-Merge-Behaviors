is a major rewrite of RegionMapDestroyTest. The test was changed enough that I doubt the diffs will be helpful. I changed it to use mocks except for the class under test.\r\nEach test method now has the pattern \"given, do, verify\".\r\nThis unit test now covers 90% of the class (used to be 60%) and the uncovered code is debug logging and what I think is dead code.\r\n\r\nI made one small change to the product to use \"putEntryIfAbsent\" instead of \"getEntryMap().putIfAbsent\".\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache Geode.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [ ] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR?
