What is this PR for?\n\nThe LivySparkSQLInterpreter class does not correctly process the userSessionMap throwing back an NPE when using %livy.sql or %sql when livy is default binding. This prevents correct sharing between Spark Sessions and SparkSQL Sessions. I have attached a fix that implements seperate static single instance classes that manage userSessionMaps.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix/Improvement\n### Todos\n\nDocumentation/Unit

What is this PR for?\n\nWe people in Twitter have great demand of adding a flexible drop down menu for the columns in the tables which enables the text/numeric conversion.\nThis is because people want some columns to be of string type which, for example, fits to the underlying DB definition.\nThe use cases of the change include:\n1. For now sorting on the columns is always lexicographically because Zeppelin front end treats the data as strings. It the values in the table can be convertible between string and number then we can sort the column by numeric values. I have filed another ticket for this: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1372\n2. Since the users know more about their data than us it would be nice if we let the users decide what is the real type of their data. It is annoying if user wants the column to be strings but the front end forcefully inserts commas in it. In some scenarios, users may also want to copy/paste the table to somewhere else. If people want to remove the commas before other actions then that will be a nightmare.... \n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement | Feature]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Task\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1371\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Click on the dropdown menu would convert the text/number of that column.\n2. Other functionalities esp. the sorting function should not be affected.\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3334391/18445617/76071f8e-78ec-11e6-93a6-fdcf7b85b6e9.png)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3334391/18446601/16cff4f0-78f1-11e6-9fd6-4010b5d77f17.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? Probably a noticeable change in UI\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-10-10T16:50:47Z","updated_at":"2016-12-02T01:57:23Z","closed_at":"2016-12-02T01:57:23Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"9175be3197103af3bfcd034218e505b0f86b62f4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1500/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1500/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1500/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/e3425ee90458d525916b91f8dbee006aa356a98a","head":{"label":"Peilin-Yang:ypeilin/table_num_cell_format","ref":"ypeilin/table_num_cell_format","sha":"e3425ee90458d525916b91f8dbee006aa356a98a","user":{"login":"Peilin-Yang","id":3334391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzQzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3334391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang","html_url":"https://github.com/Peilin-Yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":66301256,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NjMwMTI1Ng==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"Peilin-Yang/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"Peilin-Yang","id":3334391,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMzQzOTE=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3334391?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang","html_url":"https://github.com/Peilin-Yang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Peilin-Yang/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/Peilin-Yang/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nPR adds progress information in addition to progress percentage, allowing to provide links to Spark UI, for example. Currently done by adding `getProgressInfo()` method to the interpreter API that returns list of `InterpreterProgressInfo`, similar to completion API in this sense.\nMain changes are here:\n- `zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/interpreter/Interpreter.java`\n- `zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/java/org/apache/zeppelin/scheduler/Job.java`\n- `zeppelin-interpreter/src/main/thrift/RemoteInterpreterService.thrift`\n- `spark/src/main/scala/org/apache/zeppelin/spark/SparkJobDetailsListener.scala`\n- `zeppelin-web/src/app/notebook/paragraph/paragraph.controller.js`\n- `zeppelin-web/src/app/notebook/paragraph/paragraph-progressInfo.html`\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nFeature\n### Todos\n- [x] - Add unittests for `SparkJobDetailsListener`\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1528\n### How should this be tested?\n\nCurrently tested manually, by building distribution and launching simple Spark jobs in paragraph. \nAlso inspecting that progress info is updated as jobs get executed and final result is returned correctly in stdout in paragraph (initially had problems with this since there is a difference in displaying between 0.6.x and 0.7.x). \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![screenshot from 2016-10-10 17 38 02](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7788766/19227090/50c181ca-8f11-11e6-93e7-60dcc3805e63.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No.\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? Possibly.\n- Does this needs documentation? Possibly.\n","created_at":"2016-10-10T04:49:43Z","updated_at":"2017-07-05T22:43:08Z","closed_at":"2017-07-05T22:43:08Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bb87834c3c5130c45839c2604a99d0ecca92092b","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1499/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1499/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1499/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/6a69fdc7c803af5ce1b52e3e49cb7fe3c93c9f11","head":{"label":"sadikovi:spark-progress-info","ref":"spark-progress-info","sha":"6a69fdc7c803af5ce1b52e3e49cb7fe3c93c9f11","user":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":61519853,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2MTUxOTg1Mw==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"sadikovi/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"sadikovi","id":7788766,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc3ODg3NjY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7788766?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi","html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sadikovi/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/sadikovi/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nThis is different implementation of Python interpreter that communicates to external Python 2/3 process (not just REPL) though RPC. \n\nIt aims for rich feature set, missing in current implementation:\n- better error handling\n- PEP-8 syntax compatibility\n- code-completion\n- job progress/cancellation.\n- windows support\n\n![screen shot 2016-10-07 at 13 17

`%python2.dep` interpreter impl\n- [ ] install default python dependencies automatically\n- [ ] update grpc version to 1.0 to make it python3 compatible\n- [ ] make sure it works on windows\n- [ ] change  ambiguous name/package `python2` to something better, like `python-remote` or `python-rich` or something else\n- [ ] update `bin_licenses/LICENSE`\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1325](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1325)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nBind `Python2` (name will be changed) interpreter and run any python code i.e [ZEPPELIN-1133](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1133)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? Yes\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? May be\n","created_at":"2016-10-07T04:18:44Z","updated_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:26Z","closed_at":"2018-05-09T05:23:26Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"6798f98fd9cada5dd470aac5b18b048e7d5f833f","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1495/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1495/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1495/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/c0c97c1496c4287d273353358cb7baded52db962","head":{"label":"bzz:python/advanced-interpreter","ref":"python/advanced-interpreter","sha":"c0c97c1496c4287d273353358cb7baded52db962","user":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32917306,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjkxNzMwNg==","name":"incubator-zeppelin","full_name":"bzz/incubator-zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"bzz","id":5582506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1ODI1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5582506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz","html_url":"https://github.com/bzz","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bzz/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/bzz/incubator-zeppelin","description":"Mirror

What is this PR for?\n\nProvides LdapRealm Functionality similar to what Apache Knox provides. This is critical as in large enterprise environments Active Directory Global Catalogs are used for lookup with samAccountName and using a DN Template is not an option as their are multiple OUs. Also searching on \"userPrincipalName\" is risky in an AD environment since the explicit UPN vs Implicit UPN can be different this is definitely the case with environments using Office 365. And the LDAP userPrincipalName attribute is the explicit UPN which can be defined by the directory administrator to any value and it can be duplicated. SamAccountName is unique per domain and Microsoft states best practice is to not allow duplicate samAccountName's across the forest. \n\nInformation about samAccountName and userPrincipalName with

What is this PR for?\n\nCurrently we can use `%jdbc(prefix)` for multi database connections(e.g. configuring both postgresql and hive in one JDBC interpreter). But after #1360 merged, Zeppelin doesn't support `%jdbc(prefix)` to `%prefix` anymore. So auto-prefix feature is not working for `%jdbc(prefix)`. The auto-prefix only works for `%prefix` now. Considering this status, it would be better we remove the JDBC connection examples in `jdbc/interpreter-setting.json` (this is come from #1096) so that users can create several JDBC interpreters instead of using multiple connections with one JDBC interpreter.  I removed the related contents in `jdbc.md` as well.\n\nAlso, the contents of [current JDBC documentation page](http://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/interpreter/jdbc.html) is quite confusing and unorganized. So I updated the contents with some screenshot images to guide \"How to create JDBC interpreter\", \"How to edit the interpreter properties for the connection\", \"How to use `%prefix` with the interpreter\", and so on.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement & Documentation\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1489](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1489)\n### How should this be tested?\n- Removing example properties in `interpreter-setting.json`\n  1. after applying this patch and build with `mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pspark-1.6 -pl 'jdbc,zeppelin-interpreter,zeppelin-web,zeppelin-server,zeppelin-zengine,zeppelin-display'`\n  2. create JDBC interpreter and check whether the example settings are gone or not  \n- JDBC docs\n  1. Build only `docs/` dir as described in [here](https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/docs/README.md#build-documentation)\n  2. Go to `interpreter -> JDBC` and just compare this locally builded page with [the original JDBC page](https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/0.7.0-SNAPSHOT/interpreter/jdbc.html)\n### Screenshots (if

What is this PR for?\n\nZeppelin currently supports many backends for storing notes through Apache Commons VFS. \nApache Commons VFS supports HDFS in readonly mode. \nThis PR makes HDFS a first class citizen by allowing users to load notes from / save notes to HDFS.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nImprovement\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Task\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1515\n### How should this be tested?\n\nUpdate zeppelin.notebook.dir property to a value like hdfs://localhost:9000/tmp/notebook and the property zeppelin.notebook.storage to the value org.apache.zeppelin.notebook.repo.HdfsNotebookRepo\n\ncheck that your notes are loaded from and stored to HDFS by listing notes using the command :\nhdfs dfs -ls /tmp/notebook\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?

As I don't think the approach in #338 is the best approach. In #338, we use script `bin/pig` to launch pig script, it is different to control that job (hard to kill and get progress and stats info).  In this PR, I use pig api to launch pig script. Besides that I implement another interpreter type `%pig.query` to leverage the display system of zeppelin.

What is this PR for?\n\nSee #1439. This is a second attempt based on prior feedback, particularly from @Leemoonsoo who advised that it would be better to contain all of the code inside of the Interpreter Process. Aside from this, the major changes since the previous PR are:\n- The terminology \"hooks\" is used instead of \"callbacks\". Since the information being passed to the interpreter isn't actually a \"callback\", strictly speaking, the more general term \"hook\" is probably a better choice. All variable / class names were updated correspondingly.\n- The registry is now keyed by class name rather than the `replName` specified by the magic on top of the paragraph. The interface provided by `ZeppelinContext` allows for a `replName` to be converted to `className` through an internal mapping.\n- Two new event codes, `PRE_EXEC_DEV` and `POST_EXEC_DEV` have been added. This is primarily intended to separate use cases for the interpreter maintainers (via subclasses of `Interpreter`) and the notebook users (via the `ZeppelinContext` class), as otherwise user attempts at registering a hook would overwrite that set by the interpreter maintainer.\n- Global scope for hook registration is supported for the developer use cases.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nNew Feature\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1423](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1423)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nIn a new note, add the following lines of code to a paragraph:\n\n``` python\n%pyspark\nz.registerHook(\"post_exec\", \"print 'This code should be executed before the paragraph code!'\")\nz.registerHook(\"pre_exec\", \"print 'This code should be executed after the paragraph code!'\")\n```\n\nThen run any other paragraph in the note containing some other code, eg\n\n``` python\n%pyspark\nprint \"This code should be entered into the paragraph by the user!\"\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```\nThis code should be executed before the paragraph code!\nThis code should be entered into the paragraph by the user!\nThis code should be executed after the paragraph code!\n```\n\nYou should also test out the other two methods (`getCallback()` and `unregisterCallback()`) specified in `ZeppelinContext.java`.\n\nOne final caveat that should be mentioned: If there are errors in the code you specify for a pre-execute event, it will render the interpreter useless since the current implementation prepends the the code specified in `pre_exec` directly to the paragraph entered code before calling `interpret()`. The current workaround for this would be to either restart the interpreter group or call `unregisterHook()` via a different REPL within the interpreter group (eg, `z.unregisterHook(\"pre_exec\", \"pyspark\")` from the spark interpreter). I would appreciate if anyone here would be willing to share any better approaches here.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?

Any DB setup.(For my testing, i considered hive)\nSteps:\n1. Delete the local-repo folder under zeppelin project, if it exists\n2. Go to interpreter settings page, provide hive connection details under JDBC interprepreter\n3. For hive interpreter to run, it needs some dependencies to be added in interpreter settings page\n    For hive below dependencies needs to added\n    1. org.apache.hive:hive-jdbc:0.14.0\n    2. org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-common:2.6.0\n4. Once the settings for JDBC interpreter is saved, dependencies will start getting downloaded in background.\n5. Run any paragraph with JDBC as interpreter, paragraph should not throw error, status of the paragraph should change to 'pending' while the dependencies are getting downloaded in background.\n6. Once the downloading of dependencies is done, the paragraph which were in pending will start executing in order depending on the execution mode of the interpreter (i.e Shared, Scoped, Isolated)\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation? No\n","created_at":"2016-09-28T08:45:41Z","updated_at":"2016-10-22T16:26:09Z","closed_at":"2016-10-22T16:26:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b5416cb3e203b805d0d29034d6a3d49557934f74","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1467/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1467/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1467/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/b06932833671a5803ddec02d24e78577fb820585","head":{"label":null,"ref":"ZEPPELIN-1488","sha":"b06932833671a5803ddec02d24e78577fb820585","user":null,"repo":null},"base":{"label":"apache:master","ref":"master","sha":"46ecf77b7bf9cf81375136172e9dab127e17a545","user":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":32848140,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMjg0ODE0MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"apache/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"apache","id":47359,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjQ3MzU5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/47359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache","html_url":"https://github.com/apache","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/apache/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/apache/zeppelin","description":"Web-based

Regarding the integration test, some of livy's artifact is not available in repository, so I have to copy them to livy/local-maven-repo as local repository.  And LivyInterperter's integration test require spark and livy to be installed. For now you have to download spark and livy manually. Please use spark 1.5.x and livy 0.2 which is currently supported. Download livy 0.2.0 from here [https://github.com/cloudera/livy/releases](https://github.com/cloudera/livy/releases)\n\nAnd use the following command to execute the LivyIntegrationTest.\n\n```\nexport SPARK_HOME=<path_to_spark>\nexport LIVY_HOME=<path_to_livy>\nmvn clean package -pl 'livy' -Dtest=LivyIntegrationTest\n```\n\nIf you hit any issues, you can check logs under `livy/target/tmp`.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix | Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Task\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1477\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/164491/18861677/b1389622-84b9-11e6-8b0a-424457ded975.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\n\nIf user specifies library path in interpreter dependency setting, even when the file on this path is updated, new file doesn't take effect on interpreter _restart_ but does only when user _clicks Edit -> Save._\nThe mechanism of dependency loading is copying all dependency libraries under `local-repo/\n{interpreterId}` and add these directory to classpath of interpreter process. Zeppelin copies these dependencies either on Zeppelin startup or dependency saving/editing.\n\nThis PR checks if the library on specified local path is updated, and copy them to `local-repo/\n{interpreterId}` on restart if there is change.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix & Improvement\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1482](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1482)\n### How should this be tested?\n1. Download commons-csv-1.1.jar and commons-csv-1.2.jar to /my/path\n2. cp commons-csv-1.2.jar /my/path/commons-csv.jar\n3. Set dependency artifact of spark interpreter to /my/path/commons-csv.jar\n4. Run `%spark import org.apache.commons.csv.CSVFormat.Predefined` in paragraph and see if it runs without error\n5. cp commons-csv-1.1.jar /my/path/commons-csv.jar\n6. Restart spark interpreter\n7. Run `%spark import org.apache.commons.csv.CSVFormat.Predefined` in paragraph and see if error occurs.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? no\n","created_at":"2016-09-23T10:12:06Z","updated_at":"2016-11-02T04:54:06Z","closed_at":"2016-09-27T01:40:27Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4f2125d0f1aa40433ba913a41ebd24f7b6b87ad7","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1453/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1453/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1453/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/ea116648f64fcf643b0f38c15b923071ed67db81","head":{"label":"minahlee:ZEPPELIN-1482","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1482","sha":"ea116648f64fcf643b0f38c15b923071ed67db81","user":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33116265,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzExNjI2NQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"minahlee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

This cause 2 instances of SparkSession in JVM side and this means we have 2 instances of Catalog as well. So udf registered in SQLContext can not be used in SparkSession. This PR will create SparkSession first and then assign its internal SQLContext to sqlContext in pyspark. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Bug Fix]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Task\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1442\n### How should this be tested?\n\nIntegration test is added. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/164491/18774832/7f270de4-818f-11e6-9e4f-c4def4353e5c.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

If you specify spark.master as yarn-client in spark-defaults.conf but specify spark.master as local in zeppelin side, you will see the spark interpreter fail to start due to this inconsistency. \n- As ZEPPELIN-1460 described, it is hard to figure what is the effective configuration. \n- We can not use yarn-cluster mode although it is not supported now, but I think it is necessary to do that as zeppelin needs to support multiple users.\n\nThis PR would pass all the spark related configuration to spark-submit through `--conf`, so that it is easy to know and guarantee that configuration on zeppelin interpreter setting take precedence over spark-defaults.conf.  And it is also good for maintenance that upstream change (any change about configuration in spark) would not affect us. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\n[Improvement]\n### Todos\n- [ ] - Task\n### What is the Jira issue?\n- https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1263\n### How should this be tested?\n\nTested spark 1.6 spark 2.0 on both yarn-client mode and embedded mode. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/164491/18702212/3e7b54d0-8013-11e6-95f7-502b3cf89d67.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\n\nOne feature built-in to Jupyter's ipykernel that is currently missing in Zeppelin are pre/post-execute \"callbacks\". This PR allows for the possibility of entering code that is set to be executed by the interpreter before  the code entered into the paragraph (pre-execute) and after (post-execute). In addition to saving some users the effort of writing code that they want executed in every paragraph, this will help pave the way for more advanced features coming soon, like automatically displaying matplotlib figures without an explicit call to a `show()` function. See the JIRA issue for more details on this.\n\nThe core implementation for this is primarily contained in a new class called `InterpreterCallbackRegistry` which heavily mimics the Angular Display system (eg, `AngularObjectRegistry`). While this interface alone should suffice for Interpreter maintainers on the Java/JVM side, I also thought it might be useful to expose the system directly to the users in their notebooks. Hence, an implementation that works with the spark and pyspark interpreters (via the `ZeppelinContext` class) is also included here.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nNew Feature\n### Todos\n- [x] - Add unit tests\n- [x] - Add new documentation\n\n(Maybe) - Find a better way to check for errors in pre-execute as this can brick the REPL (see more info below)\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n[ZEPPELIN-1423](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZEPPELIN-1423)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nIn a new note, add the following lines of code to a paragraph:\n\n``` python\n%pyspark\nz.registerCallback(\"post_exec\", \"print 'This code should be executed before the parapgraph code!'\")\nz.registerCallback(\"pre_exec\", \"print 'This code should be executed after the paragraph code!'\")\n```\n\nThen run any other paragraph in the note containing some other code, eg\n\n``` python\n%pyspark\nprint \"This code should be entered into the paragraph by the user!\"\n```\n\nThe output should be:\n\n```\nThis code should be executed before the paragraph code!\nThis code should be entered into the paragraph by the user!\nThis code should be executed after the paragraph code!\n```\n\nYou should also test out the other two methods (`getCallback()` and `unregisterCallback()`) specified in `ZeppelinContext.java`.\n\nOne final caveat that should be mentioned: If there are errors in the code you specify for a pre-execute event, it will render the interpreter useless since the current implementation prepends the the code specified in `pre_exec` directly to the paragraph entered code before calling `interpret()`. The current workaround for this would be to either restart the interpreter group or call `unregisterCallback()` via a different REPL within the interpreter group (eg, `z.unregisterCallback(\"pre_exec\", \"pyspark\")` from the spark interpreter). I would appreciate if anyone here would be willing to share any better approaches here.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? No\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? No\n- Does this needs documentation?

Register it from path {ZEPPELIN_HOME}/interpreter/{interpreter_name}/ interpreter-setting.json\n         \\* 2. Register it from interpreter-setting.json in classpath {ZEPPELIN_HOME}/interpreter/{interpreter_name}\n         \\* 3.

And also modify file interpreter/spark/interpreter-setting.json to make pyspark as the default interpreter and it works. Before this PR, it doesn't work, because it would be override by interpreter-setting.json in `interpreter/spark/zeppelin-spark_2.10-0.7.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/164491/18621557/a4510966-7e57-11e6-8c9a-80697ebf2600.png)\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update?

What is this PR for?\n\n\"Currently there are no properties and dependencies set for this interpreter\" message is shown when there are no properties & dependencies in interpreter setting page. But this message can be seen even in the edit mode. It's quite wired. This message needs to be shown only in non-editable mode.\n\nThe `edit`, `restart` and `remove` button are same. \n- `edit` button doesn't do any work after changing to edit mode\n- `restart` button: it doesn't make sense that someone is editing and restarting interpreter at the same time\n- `remove` button: Maybe someone wants to remove the interpreter while he is editing the interpreter. But it would be better this button is shown only in non-editable mode for the consistency with the other buttons. \n\nFor the above reasons, I changed those buttons to be shown in non-editable mode only. `Save` & `Cancel` buttons are enough to the edit page I think. Please see the attached gif image. \n### What type of PR is it?\n\nBug Fix\n### What is the Jira issue?\n### How should this be tested?\n1. After applying this patch and build only `zeppelin-web` with `./grunt build` under `zeppelin-web`. \n2. You can quickly check this change in dev mode with `./grunt serve`. \n3. Go to `Interpreter` menu and click \"edit\" button on Angular interpreter to see \"Currently there are no properties and dependencies set for this interpreter\" message. Can also check the existence of `edit`, `restart` and `remove` buttons. \n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n- Before\n

What is this PR for?\n\nA few sentences describing the overall goals of the pull request's commits.\nFirst time? Check out the contributing guide - https://github.com/apache/zeppelin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThis is a rewrite of the \"Quick Start\" page, fixing syntax/grammar issues while trying to keep to the original content. I may look at other pages, but I wanted my first PR to be very small.\n### What type of PR is it?\n\nDocumentation\n### Todos\n\nVerify the accuracy of the configuration settings section\n### What is the Jira issue?\n\n(Does this apply to documentation PRs?)\n### How should this be tested?\n\nDo documentation changes like this need to be tested?\nIf so, is the github preview sufficient for these changes? How is Zeppelin's markdown interpreter different than Github's?\nIf Github's MD preview isn't sufficient, is it possible to build the documentation locally?\n### Screenshots (if appropriate)\n### Questions:\n- Since this is my first PR on the project, I limited the scope of my changes. Is there any desire to  change the content of these pages in any way? Do we have documentation conventions?\n","created_at":"2016-09-08T18:56:37Z","updated_at":"2016-09-25T07:01:43Z","closed_at":"2016-09-25T07:01:43Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"bc2e80e10dcbcaf518266b3cb8ceb49e0be15f1c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1416/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1416/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1416/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/f2c126bdb9bfc51bb59b7b02e7cbcece92cf32de","head":{"label":"rfilmyer:master","ref":"master","sha":"f2c126bdb9bfc51bb59b7b02e7cbcece92cf32de","user":{"login":"rfilmyer","id":5913205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTMyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5913205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer","html_url":"https://github.com/rfilmyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":67726880,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk2NzcyNjg4MA==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"rfilmyer/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"rfilmyer","id":5913205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5MTMyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5913205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer","html_url":"https://github.com/rfilmyer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rfilmyer/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/rfilmyer/zeppelin","description":"Mirror

These can be handled with another jira ticket/PR.\n1. When default bound interpreter changes, syntax highlight is not changed accordingly\n2. When copy/paste code, syntax highlight won't be applied properly since Zeppelin only checks changes when cursor is in first line.\n### Questions:\n- Does the licenses files need update? no\n- Is there breaking changes for older versions? no\n- Does this needs documentation? yes(for creating new interpreter)\n","created_at":"2016-09-08T15:00:45Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T19:05:33Z","closed_at":"2016-09-23T07:47:58Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"8e0fad0bdc3cf6dd13c8d8e00f7df7726cb8f67d","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1415/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/1415/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/issues/1415/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/zeppelin/statuses/c66fb0ed06c1a48fd449cba63879d32327b48407","head":{"label":"minahlee:ZEPPELIN-1026","ref":"ZEPPELIN-1026","sha":"c66fb0ed06c1a48fd449cba63879d32327b48407","user":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":33116265,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMzExNjI2NQ==","name":"zeppelin","full_name":"minahlee/zeppelin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"minahlee","id":8503346,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg1MDMzNDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8503346?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee","html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/minahlee/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/minahlee/zeppelin","description":"Mirror
