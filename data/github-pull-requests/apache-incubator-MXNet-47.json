complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc

are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed

finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this

Description ##\r\nFixes #13446 flaky test test_random:test_randint_generator \r\nUses the PR #13543 to get rid of the fix seed and make the test robust\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Created the alpha variable to ensure consistency\r\n- Scipy uses 0.01 for discrete distribution here - https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/9f12af697763fb5f9767d5cb1280ce62456a3974/scipy/stats/tests/test_discrete_basic.py#L45\r\nHence for testing `randint` (discrete uniform distribution) specifically passed alpha=0.01\r\n- Due to random factor lacking robustness had to set fixed seed to prevent CI from failing","created_at":"2018-12-01T00:43:05Z","updated_at":"2019-07-29T22:27:37Z","closed_at":"2018-12-07T07:49:17Z","merged_at":"2018-12-07T07:49:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"0011ab2f4bf87619cdfe0bb928d74c5ae0df452c","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":721783588,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MjE3ODM1ODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Flaky","name":"Flaky","color":"fc2929","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nScala jni shared library requires compile flags inherited from make. But there is no way to enforce those flags to be the same as libmxnet.so was built. And current Scala package is built is manually. This is error prone can has caused issues in past. \r\n\r\nThis fix is trying make scala jni library not depends on any mxnet build flags, and dynamically link libmxnet.so directly. libmxnet-scala.so file will be compiled dynamically link to libmxnet.so, and allows load libmxnet.so from the same directory. Scala code is also updated to extract libmxnet.so file into temp folder and load it temp folder.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixes some of the remaining Sphinx errors and warnings coming out the Python/website part of docs generation. It fixes some Scala-related docs errors too.\r\n \r\n🐞  [get_constant ambiguous reference](http://34.201.8.176/versions/scala_docs_errors/api/python/gluon/gluon.html#mxnet.gluon.ParameterDict.get_constant) - fixed this Sphinx error; interesting note that text right after the `Returns` line is expected to be an entity so you have to make sure the reference is good and unambiguous.\r\n🐞  Scala docs used interpreter examples, but the current jar doesn't work with the interpreter, so I removed this notion from the [index](http://34.201.8.176/versions/scala_docs_errors/api/scala/index.html), [ndarray](http://34.201.8.176/versions/scala_docs_errors/api/scala/ndarray.html), [kvstore](http://34.201.8.176/versions/scala_docs_errors/api/scala/kvstore.html), and [symbol](http://34.201.8.176/versions/scala_docs_errors/api/scala/symbol.html) pages. `kvstore` and `ndarray` also had Sphinx errors, which are fixed now.\r\n🐞  The [gluon index](http://34.201.8.176/versions/scala_docs_errors/gluon/index.html) page had parsing errors. I think it is because the python code on that page isn't really functional and Sphinx was running it and failing. So I removed the python declarations. A gluon expert should really take a look and see what that page needs as far as an update with the latest/greatest info...\r\n🐞  [ubuntu setup](http://34.201.8.176/versions/scala_docs_errors/install/ubuntu_setup.html) - I already updated the pip package graphic, so this old table was not needed... and it was causing a Sphinx warning, so I removed it.\r\n🐞  [r tutorial fix](http://34.201.8.176/versions/scala_docs_errors/tutorials/r/fiveMinutesNeuralNetwork.html) - this had `{r}` on one of the code blocks... Sphinx/Pygments didn't like it, so I removed the braces.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-30T17:43:53Z","updated_at":"2018-12-04T19:16:10Z","closed_at":"2018-12-04T19:16:10Z","merged_at":"2018-12-04T19:16:10Z","merge_commit_sha":"d60f37bf317da6fc48e4fa4d52d02d51f13e95b9","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":588394144,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1ODgzOTQxNDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Doc","name":"Doc","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null},{"id":708199304,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDgxOTkzMDQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Website","name":"Website","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":null}],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13488/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13488/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13488/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/6c44d8b1048b67a4aebe79121d56cb3598027fed","head":{"label":"aaronmarkham:scala_docs_errors","ref":"scala_docs_errors","sha":"6c44d8b1048b67a4aebe79121d56cb3598027fed","user":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":105819747,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMDU4MTk3NDc=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"aaronmarkham","id":5974205,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzQyMDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5974205?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham","html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aaronmarkham/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/aaronmarkham/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

The earlier version only returns the include path when MXNet is built from source. The relative path is different if MXNet is built from pip.\r\n\r\nThis PR is needed by Horovod MXNet integration. The API only returns the include path so it should not impact MXNet performance or functionality.","created_at":"2018-11-30T04:02:53Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T23:48:29Z","closed_at":"2018-11-30T23:48:29Z","merged_at":"2018-11-30T23:48:29Z","merge_commit_sha":"ff4c178ec4d5a08846eadb71ca1d5547713d48ad","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-30T00:21:44Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T01:07:52Z","closed_at":"2018-11-30T03:54:53Z","merged_at":"2018-11-30T03:54:53Z","merge_commit_sha":"eb82da8609563de1e62fada2e4ad62b0d0fb2fba","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":337768593,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwzMzc3Njg1OTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Scala","name":"Scala","color":"0052cc","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Due to Python GIL, they are evaluated in single thread, sequentially, which may become a problem once number of used GPUs is large enough.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Changed TopKAccuracy metric implementation from using numpy.argsort to numpy.argpartition, which from my experiments on NDArrays of shape (208,1000) and top_k=5 is ~4x faster \r\n- [x] Added global statistics to metrics. We noticed the problem with metrics speed after PR #12182 which introduced computing the metrics twice (once for giving the immediate values for accuracy and once for computing accuracy over the entire epoch). This is wasteful, since the calculations needed are exactly the same in this case. This PR introduces additional fields in EvalMetric class (global_sum_metric and global_num_inst), accessors for them (get_global and get_global_name_values) and function reset_local which performs reset only on non-global versions of statistics. It also modifies all current metrics to be able to use the global statistics. That way, while the code is backward compatible (one can still just use get/get_name_values/reset functions), it also eliminates overhead introduced by calculating statistics twice in fit function.\r\n\r\nCC @vandanavk for comments.

Description ##\r\nThis is a ~~WIP~~ PR ~~to share progress~~ on the maven nightly jenkins pipeline. The goal is to create a Jenkins for continuous deployment that will build scala jars, test them on multiple different environments, and then deploy them to the apache snapshot repository. It can also provide some setup for building out additional continuous deployment efforts for other platforms such as pip.\r\n\r\n~~Note that this PR depends on https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13046 and is rebased on top of it. Those changes are displayed as part of the first commit in the PR.~~\r\n\r\n@nswamy @lanking520 @andrewfayres @piyushghai @marcoabreu @yzhliu \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease

Description ##\r\nRewrite dataloader with multiprocess.pool, the logic of dataloader with `num_worker>0` is cleaner and more robust.\r\n\r\nChanges with this PR:\r\n\r\n- Secure MXIndexRecordIO reader handler with process id, note that to perseve perf, no lock is introduced, separate processes will obtain new handlers to the record file.  \r\n- Replaced manual queue handling with built-in `multiprocessing.Pool`, no matter how many epochs and iterators are launched, they share same process pool. The benefit is two fold: 1) It's faster, since new iterators will no longer trying to fork new processes 2) it's more reliable, the process pool is managed along with the entire life of dataloader, not iterators. \r\n- __Benchmarked with ResNet 50 on ImageNet, p3-x16 instance with 8 GPUs and 60 CPU workers, images/sec bumped from (1500-2400) to (3000-3100), it's faster and more stable__\r\n- Added an option `prefetch=None`: \r\n\r\n```\r\nprefetch : int, default is `num_workers * 2`\r\n        The number of prefetching batches only works if `num_workers` > 0.\r\n        If `prefetch` > 0, it allow worker process to prefetch certain batches before\r\n        acquiring data from iterators.\r\n        Note that using large prefetching batch will provide smoother bootstrapping performance,\r\n        but will consume more shared_memory. Using smaller number may forfeit the purpose of using\r\n        multiple worker processes, try reduce `num_workers` in this case.\r\n        By default it defaults to `num_workers * 2`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe rest functionality and APIs are intact with this PR. No action is required for exisiting users.\r\n\r\nThanks @szha @leezu for the ideas.\r\n@piiswrong @eric-haibin-lin @hetong007 @YutingZhang  for review and questions\r\n\r\nThis PR may affect gluoncv and gluonnlp dataloader variants, I will address them separately. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR

Description ##\r\ndgl_graph_compact works with `csr_neighbor_uniform_sample` and `csr_neighbor_non_uniform_sample`. These two sampling operators create CSR matrices with many empty rows. This operator compacts these CSR matrices.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with

Description ##\r\nPR to fix issues - https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/13421. Added unit test for deconvolution inference and reverted refactor change to mkldnn  deconvolution inference commmited in https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/11778.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] refactor change to mkldnn  deconvolution inference. \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-28T01:19:37Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T02:15:22Z","closed_at":"2018-11-30T01:24:19Z","merged_at":"2018-11-30T01:24:19Z","merge_commit_sha":"8a3bd9bf2d896e48dd26e6701f16fe132685ce4e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":978567321,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5Nzg1NjczMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/MKLDNN","name":"MKLDNN","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Remove redundant line in build from source doc \r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-27T23:24:08Z","updated_at":"2018-11-29T05:56:39Z","closed_at":"2018-11-29T05:56:39Z","merged_at":"2018-11-29T05:56:39Z","merge_commit_sha":"d7b9bea9c9cef78d607761a285d9f1ced551a73e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799529,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5NTI5","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-merge","name":"pr-awaiting-merge","color":"0e8a16","default":false,"description":"Review

##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-13420/1/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change","created_at":"2018-11-27T09:33:19Z","updated_at":"2018-11-27T21:26:24Z","closed_at":"2018-11-27T21:26:24Z","merged_at":"2018-11-27T21:26:24Z","merge_commit_sha":"e6fffe901fb0a07508d2d755957c84f84a11f7b8","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"yzhliu","id":631860,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYzMTg2MA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/631860?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu","html_url":"https://github.com/yzhliu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yzhliu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"nswamy","id":1208642,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMDg2NDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1208642?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy","html_url":"https://github.com/nswamy","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nswamy/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR enables dynamic shape in CachedOp, a.k.a. the backend supporting `HybridBlock` in Gluon.\r\n\r\nIn the forward pass, we have to invoke operators one-by-one because dynamic shape disallows us to allocate memory ahead of time.\r\n\r\nThe backward pass is actually unaffected, because after forward, shape of everything becomes known.\r\n\r\nCC: @zheng-da @szha @yidawang\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Add `NaiveRunGraph` in imperative mode, in which operators are executed in a synchronized manner.\r\n- [x] Add `NaiveForward` mode in CachedOp, which calls `NaiveRunGraph`.\r\n- [x] Add `CheckDynamicShapeExists` in CachedOp, which tells whether the graph contains an operator returning dynamic shape.\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Yet another mode in the executor of CachedOp. Perhaps we need to refactor some day.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-27T08:04:56Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T01:30:09Z","closed_at":"2019-01-29T01:30:09Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"b64106c0d46d24fec3e7aeb78c553f2339596e54","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":707556574,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw3MDc1NTY1NzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/Operator","name":"Operator","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":null},{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThis PR fixed the large array issue (#13036, #13070) in the following operators:\r\nndarray.ones\r\nndarray.zeros\r\nndarray.sum\r\nndarray.slice\r\nndarray.random.uniform\r\nndarray.empty\r\n\r\nThis PR is only the first effort that addresses some limitations in some basic operators. More tests and fix are coming as we identify more operators. This is part of a large project tracked in JIRA by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MXNET-1184\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [X] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [X] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [X] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones\r\n- [X] Code is well-documented: \r\n- [X] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [X] Support large array (> 3billion elements) in certain operators\r\n- [X] Added nightly tests on arrays of 5 billion elements\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\nThis PR only supports the total number of elements in the array to go beyond 2 billion. The max shape size in any of the dimension is still limited to 2^31 because this PR does not update the C API. Due to the large change required in all language bindings, we decided to break the original PR (https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/pull/13191) into several smaller parts. And this PR is part 1. \r\n\r\nThis PR only changes the indexing variable type from int32_t to int64_t, not the data type of each element. No performance impact observed. For future guidance of data types to choose, please refer to

adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not

Description ##\r\n\r\nThis tutorials aims to provide Gluon users an overview of the end to end workflow from training to inference. Since there are too many sections in the workflow, we will use a simple fine tuning example and provide links to more details tutorials on each specific topic. \r\n\r\nThe sections including:\r\n1. Load pre-trained model\r\n2. Modify the network using Gluon imperative mode\r\n3. Hybridize the network and training\r\n4. Save fine-tuned model\r\n5. Inferece using C++ API\r\n\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-26T18:02:45Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T22:31:47Z","closed_at":"2019-01-24T19:35:15Z","merged_at":"2019-01-24T19:35:15Z","merge_commit_sha":"4700b40a9d9f2bcd915d959381203db5a8b84f89","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018870493,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4ODcwNDkz","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-work-in-progress","name":"pr-work-in-progress","color":"5319e7","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nExposes ReLU activation shape inference bug via C++ unit test.\r\nFixes Activation gradient shape inference problems due to different activation functions have different input parameters in backward, also depending on GPU / MKLDNN / CPU. \r\nThe logic now is now easier to maintain and safer.\r\nThis bug is uncovered when running C++ unit tests without MKL and without GPU, which we were not doing.\r\n\r\nFixes #13333\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with

coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-13405/1/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-26T04:07:47Z","updated_at":"2018-11-26T17:14:57Z","closed_at":"2018-11-26T17:14:57Z","merged_at":"2018-11-26T17:14:57Z","merge_commit_sha":"e9c8db735d16a8ccd877432e90fb02b07fefdd46","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13405/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13405/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13405/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/83cdbf250eb3efe1fa74b9b35a5cc36393edd15c","head":{"label":"andrewfayres:JavaDev","ref":"JavaDev","sha":"83cdbf250eb3efe1fa74b9b35a5cc36393edd15c","user":{"login":"andrewfayres","id":13068555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY4NTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13068555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewfayres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":131324578,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzEzMjQ1Nzg=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"andrewfayres/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"andrewfayres","id":13068555,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMDY4NTU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13068555?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres","html_url":"https://github.com/andrewfayres","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/andrewfayres/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/andrewfayres/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

Description ##\r\n[conan](https://conan.io) is an open-source package manager for C++ projects. it allows to manage project dependencies in transparent and declarative manner.\r\n\r\ncurrently, apache incubator-mxnet project uses the following different ways to manage its dependencies:\r\n * download GitHub archives during the build\r\n     * [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS)\r\n     * [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)\r\n * [conda](https://conda.io/) (alternative way to GitHub archives)\r\n * download from CMake\r\n     * [Intel Math Kernel Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl) (MKL)\r\n * Git submodules\r\n     * [cub](https://github.com/dmlc/cub)\r\n     * [dlpack](https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack)\r\n     * [dmlc-core](https://github.com/dmlc/dmlc-core)\r\n     * [googletest](https://github.com/abseil/googletest)\r\n     * [mkldnn](https://github.com/intel/mkl-dnn)\r\n     * [mshadow](https://github.com/dmlc/mshadow)\r\n     * [onnx-tensorrt](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorrt)\r\n     * [openmp](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/openmp)\r\n     * [ps-lite](https://github.com/dmlc/ps-lite)\r\n     * [tvm](https://github.com/dmlc/tvm)\r\n\r\nthis appears to be very heterogeneous and hard to manage/maintain, as multiple various commands are in use to achieve dependencies installation, as well as multiple places are to look for dependency versions and their updates.\r\n\r\nwith conan, it may became much more straightforward, as dependencies will be declared in single place (conanfile) and installed via single command (conan install).\r\n\r\nas project is very complex, and has lots of dependencies, for the first prototype I've used only very few of dependencies from conan: `OpenCV`, `OpenBLAS` and `lapack`.\r\nothers may be easily added then one by one, but they first has to be packaged (not all of them are packaged yet, e.g. `GoogleTest` is [available](https://bintray.com/bincrafters/public-conan/gtest%3Abincrafters), while `MKL` is not).\r\n\r\nfor instance, I've used the following script to run local conan build on Windows:\r\n```\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\n\r\nconan remote add conan-community https://api.bintray.com/conan/conan-community/conan || echo \"ignore\"\r\n\r\nconan install ^\r\n  --update ^\r\n  -s os=Windows ^\r\n  -s arch=x86_64 ^\r\n  -s compiler=\"Visual Studio\" ^\r\n  -s compiler.version=14 ^\r\n  -s compiler.runtime=MT ^\r\n  -s build_type=Release ^\r\n  -g cmake .. \r\n  \r\nREM --build opencv\r\n\r\ncmake .. ^\r\n  -DUSE_PROFILER=1 ^\r\n  -DUSE_CUDA=0 ^\r\n  -DUSE_CUDNN=0 ^\r\n  -DUSE_NVRTC=0 ^\r\n  -DUSE_OPENCV=1 ^\r\n  -DUSE_OPENMP=1 ^\r\n  -DUSE_BLAS=open ^\r\n  -DUSE_LAPACK=1 ^\r\n  -DUSE_DIST_KVSTORE=0 ^\r\n  -DOpenCV_STATIC=ON ^\r\n  -G \"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64\"\r\n\r\ncmake --build . --config Release\r\n```\r\n\r\nsimilarly, the same can be achieved on Linux or Mac OS X:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n\r\nmkdir -p build\r\npushd build\r\n\r\nconan remote add conan-community https://api.bintray.com/conan/conan-community/conan || echo \"ignore\"\r\n\r\nconan install \\\r\n  --update \\\r\n  -s arch=x86_64 \\\r\n  -s build_type=Release \\\r\n  -g cmake ..\r\n\r\ncmake .. \\\r\n  -DUSE_PROFILER=1 \\\r\n  -DUSE_CUDA=0 \\\r\n  -DUSE_CUDNN=0 \\\r\n  -DUSE_NVRTC=0 \\\r\n  -DUSE_OPENCV=1 \\\r\n  -DUSE_OPENMP=1 \\\r\n  -DUSE_BLAS=open \\\r\n  -DUSE_LAPACK=1 \\\r\n  -DUSE_DIST_KVSTORE=0 \\\r\n  -DOpenCV_STATIC=ON \\\r\n  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \\\r\n  -G \"Unix Makefiles\"\r\n\r\ncmake --build . --config Release\r\n\r\npopd\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] added **conanfile.py** to declare project dependencies (for now, just [OpenCV](https://bintray.com/conan-community/conan/opencv%3Aconan), [OpenBLAS](https://bintray.com/conan-community/conan/openblas%3Aconan) and [lapack](https://bintray.com/conan-community/conan/lapack%3Aconan))\r\n- [x] added an optional conan integration to the **CMakeLists.txt** (project might still be built without conan)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n\r\n/cc @memsharded @lasote @danimtb @jgsogo

Description ##\r\nThe default kernel launch method doesn't use the dynamic openmp scheduling primitive, which suffers from workload balance problem when doing sparse matrix multiplication. This PR add LaunchDynamic method to the original Kernel class. \r\n\r\n@zheng-da \r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-25T07:46:48Z","updated_at":"2019-12-12T00:14:58Z","closed_at":"2018-11-27T02:42:12Z","merged_at":"2018-11-27T02:42:12Z","merge_commit_sha":"f1de8e51999ce3acaa95538d21a91fe43a0286ec","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018799191,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk5MTkx","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-response","name":"pr-awaiting-response","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nThe adjacency operator is implemented for DGL that converts a CSR matrix with edge Id to an adjacency matrix for SpMV.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [ ] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [ ] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [ ] Feature1, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n- [ ] Feature2, tests, (and when applicable, API doc)\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- If this change is a backward incompatible change, why must this change be made.\r\n- Interesting edge cases to note here\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-25T03:02:57Z","updated_at":"2018-11-28T19:20:47Z","closed_at":"2018-11-28T19:20:47Z","merged_at":"2018-11-28T19:20:47Z","merge_commit_sha":"a7d17a42a08e6006605533a6dc2a3873040efca1","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"anirudh2290","id":1522319,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1MjIzMTk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1522319?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290","html_url":"https://github.com/anirudh2290","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/anirudh2290/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[{"id":1018798522,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMDE4Nzk4NTIy","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/labels/pr-awaiting-review","name":"pr-awaiting-review","color":"d93f0b","default":false,"description":"PR

Description ##\r\nAdds Clojure installation docs to MXNet website\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [ ] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the relevant [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MXNET/issues) created (except PRs with tiny changes)\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [ ] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [ ] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n### Changes ###\r\n- [x] Enables Clojure installation docs for Linux CPU and GPU\r\n- [x] Enables Clojure installation docs for MacOS CPU\r\n- [x] Adds placeholder for MacOS GPU and Windows installation docs\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- To validate the changes, built the docs in Python virtual environment via ``make docs USE_OPENMP=1``\r\n- Here are the screenshots for Clojure tab placement and related docs:\r\n\r\n#### MXNet-Clojure Linux

This change fixes this behavior by using sym.list_outputs() to record all output

PR adds utility slaves.\r\n\r\nThe idea of utility slaves is to offload miscellaneous lifecycle-tasks that are not actually part of the task but rather involved to keep the pipeline alive. We should not process these tasks on the same slaves as actual workload since this has multiple implications:\r\n1. mxnetlinux-cpu slaves are very powerful and only have 3 executors. We don't need 72 CPU cores to load a groovy script\r\n2. Lifecycle tasks like publishing the GitHub status to PRs share the same queue as regular workload. During high load, this might result in a PR not being notified that a job has been queued (or finished) until a mxnetlinux-cpu worker is free. This might confuse the user.\r\n3. Since a lifecycle task might be only executed when it reaches the top of the queue, the follow-up jobs will only be added to the queue after the lifecycle job has been processed. Only at this point, the real jobs will be enqueued. This means that it has two wait for it's part twice. Especially considering our auto scaling gets triggered every 5 minutes, it could mean that the real workload misses multiple scaling cycles since the lifecycle job hasn't passed yet and thus the \"real\" jobs haven't been scheduled yet.\r\n\r\nBasically what this replaces is the concept of a high-priority queue. Since we don't have that system in Jenkins (and neither do we want to use expensive slaves for that), we can instead make these slaves with a lot of executors and a special label.\r\n\r\nThis job is NOT intended to run ANY custom workload but only to execute Jenkins operations that require a node context. Usually, these tasks would run on the Jenkins master, but I disabled that for security reasons.\r\n\r\nThe slave would be a c5.large with 2vCPUs.","created_at":"2018-11-23T13:56:11Z","updated_at":"2018-11-23T21:25:37Z","closed_at":"2018-11-23T21:25:37Z","merged_at":"2018-11-23T21:25:37Z","merge_commit_sha":"aee0953e10c82643e3dffd0be009edabd70d6f98","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[{"login":"szha","id":2626883,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MjY4ODM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2626883?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha","html_url":"https://github.com/szha","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/szha/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false}],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13383/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/13383/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/issues/13383/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/mxnet/statuses/7ba3b7298f836b84d2f08e03e464400e6fdd3491","head":{"label":"marcoabreu:add-utility-slave","ref":"add-utility-slave","sha":"7ba3b7298f836b84d2f08e03e464400e6fdd3491","user":{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":113563686,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMTM1NjM2ODY=","name":"incubator-mxnet","full_name":"marcoabreu/incubator-mxnet","private":false,"owner":{"login":"marcoabreu","id":18629099,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjI5MDk5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18629099?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu","html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/marcoabreu/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/marcoabreu/incubator-mxnet","description":"Lightweight,

verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n@aaronmarkham

Description ##\r\nArguments to make for the mxnet build can be passed either directly through the command line or through config.mk. The install instructions are inconsistent and use both options. However, some frontends such as scala require the arguments as well so they must be passed to both the initial make and the following \"make scalapkg\". Failure to pass the arguments to the scalapkg make can result in an improper configuration and slower performance. To resolve this, I am switching the install instructions to consistently use the config.mk because it is automatically used by all make commands which resolves the potential frontend problems.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] The PR title starts with [MXNET-$JIRA_ID], where $JIRA_ID refers to the

Description ##\r\nThis PR adds NHWC layout support to Pooling operator. Work mostly done by @DickJC123 \r\n\r\nTraining using TensorCores is more efficient when using NHWC data layout. Convolutions and BatchNorm operators in MXNet already have support for NHWC, while Pooling operator currently accepts only NCHW format. This PR introduces NHWC layout support for Pooling when using cuDNN.\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of upstreaming improvements available in NVIDIA's NGC MXNet container and was tested as part of it to train multiple convnets to expected accuracy. We also introduced additional tests checking consistency between NHWC and NCHW versions of pooling.\r\n\r\n## Checklist ##\r\n### Essentials ###\r\nPlease feel free to remove inapplicable items for your PR.\r\n- [x] Changes are complete (i.e. I finished coding on this PR)\r\n- [x] All changes have test coverage:\r\n- Unit tests are added for small changes to verify correctness (e.g. adding a new operator)\r\n- Nightly tests are added for complicated/long-running ones (e.g. changing distributed kvstore)\r\n- Build tests will be added for build configuration changes (e.g. adding a new build option with NCCL)\r\n- [x] Code is well-documented: \r\n- For user-facing API changes, API doc string has been updated. \r\n- For new C++ functions in header files, their functionalities and arguments are documented. \r\n- For new examples, README.md is added to explain the what the example does, the source of the dataset, expected performance on test set and reference to the original paper if applicable\r\n- Check the API doc at http://mxnet-ci-doc.s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com/PR-$PR_ID/$BUILD_ID/index.html\r\n- [x] To the my best knowledge, examples are either not affected by this change, or have been fixed to be compatible with this change\r\n\r\n## Comments ##\r\n- Support for channel last is done only when cuDNN is enabled (noted in the updated
