is a very involved new feature. At this point, it is functioning well but has the following caveats:\r\n- We need to do a better job of reconciling 'client' with nodes in the cluster for authorization purposes.\r\n- It currently points at a SNAPSHOT version of the nifi-registry. NiFi-Registry will need to be released before this is merged to master. This is due to the VersionedConnection object in the data model being updated such that it now supports configuration of load-balancing properties.\r\n\r\nAt this point, though, because the changeset is extremely large, I think it makes sense to post a Work-In-Progress PR so that others can begin looking at it. It may also be helpful to reference the Feature Proposal for this feature at

In order to do this it must be configured to not support username/password authentication using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) or Kerberos. Either of these options will configure the web server to WANT certificate based client authentication. This will allow it to support users with certificates and those without that may be logging in with their credentials or those accessing anonymously. If username/password authentication and anonymous access are not configured, the web server will REQUIRE certificate based client authentication.

you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [x] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [x] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [x] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n\r\n```\r\nI started to write unit tests for these changes then realized that the tests were really verifying the evaluation of the EL expressions, and I assume far better unit tests for this already exist. I will attach a video of me verifying expected behavior of a build of this branch to the JIRA ticket.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a

PR to https://github.com/apache/nifi/pull/2085 (created by @jdye64). Created a new PR since the remote originally used no longer exists.\r\n\r\nWe'll be focusing on adding the changes requested by @alopresto in the original pull request:\r\n\r\n- [ ] It looks like somehow an empty file was added at nifi/nifi-nar-bundles/nifi-update-attribute-bundle/nifi-update-attribute-ui/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/authorize.jsp. I only noticed this because it failed the RAT check. I imagine this can be deleted?\r\n- [ ] An unused field remains in AbstractOAuthControllerService: protected long expireTimeSafetyNetSeconds = -1;\r\n- [ ] OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantControllerService.CLIENT_ID and OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantControllerService.CLIENT_SECRET don't support expression language (with the variable registry and NiFi Registry, these values will likely be populated externally)\r\n- [ ] The exception handling in OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantControllerService#authenticate can be condensed\r\n- [ ] There are no unit or integration tests. I understand a real integration test with an external service is difficult, but unit tests for OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantControllerService#authenticate() (via mocking OAuthHTTPConnectionClient#execute()) and AbstractOAuthControllerService#isOAuthTokenExpired() would be helpful\r\n- [ ] There is no update to the User Guide or Admin Guide describing this feature. At a minimum, the InvokeHTTP processor documentation should be updated\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for submitting a contribution to Apache NiFi.\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline the review of the contribution we ask you\r\nto ensure the following steps have been taken:\r\n\r\n### For all changes:\r\n- [x] Is there a JIRA ticket associated with this PR? Is it referenced \r\n     in the commit message?\r\n\r\n- [x] Does your PR title start with NIFI-XXXX where XXXX is the JIRA number you are trying to resolve? Pay particular attention to the hyphen \"-\" character.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Has your PR been rebased against the latest commit within the target branch (typically master)?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Is your initial contribution a single, squashed commit?\r\n\r\n### For code changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that the full suite of tests is executed via mvn -Pcontrib-check clean install at the root nifi folder?\r\n- [ ] Have you written or updated unit tests to verify your changes?\r\n- [ ] If adding new dependencies to the code, are these dependencies licensed in a way that is compatible for inclusion under [ASF 2.0](http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-a)? \r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the LICENSE file, including the main LICENSE file under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If applicable, have you updated the NOTICE file, including the main NOTICE file found under nifi-assembly?\r\n- [ ] If adding new Properties, have you added .displayName in addition to .name (programmatic access) for each of the new properties?\r\n\r\n### For documentation related changes:\r\n- [ ] Have you ensured that format looks appropriate for the output in which it is rendered?\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\nPlease ensure that once the PR is submitted, you check travis-ci for build issues and submit an update to your PR as soon as possible.\r\n","created_at":"2018-07-17T13:19:12Z","updated_at":"2020-05-26T12:05:33Z","closed_at":"2020-05-25T22:23:53Z","merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"ddb7e589d7e5ebf5293cd460676c1ff036f3ea39","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/2901/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/2901/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/issues/2901/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/apache/nifi/statuses/1bc6cd50b4013de1269f2978b62e148325f550a7","head":{"label":"onaio:NIFI-4246","ref":"NIFI-4246","sha":"1bc6cd50b4013de1269f2978b62e148325f550a7","user":{"login":"onaio","id":5450613,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU0NTA2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5450613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio","html_url":"https://github.com/onaio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":138885316,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkxMzg4ODUzMTY=","name":"nifi","full_name":"onaio/nifi","private":false,"owner":{"login":"onaio","id":5450613,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjU0NTA2MTM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5450613?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio","html_url":"https://github.com/onaio","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/onaio/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/onaio/nifi","description":"Mirror
