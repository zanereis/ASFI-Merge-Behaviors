This requires about 600MB.  I don't know if this is the right default or not.\r\n\r\n3. I'm open to refactoring the code to create better interfaces, but here's what I did for now.  I did three commits for ease of understanding.  The first adds a StorageMetrics interface so that the number of actual spans retained can be shown (as opposed to the CollectorMetrics, which shows the number of spans received).  The second adds the InMemorySpanConsumer.purge() method, along with tests and metrics for it, but doesn't actually enforce a max span size.  The third and final commit wires all that up.\r\n\r\n4. I added a max(long, long) method temporarily until I can figure out how to make Long.max(long, long) acceptable to animal-sniffer.\r\n\r\n5. I had to add two purgeTraceIdTimeStamps() methods since I haven't figured out how to get access to the values of serviceToTraceIdTimeStamp as an ordered set, like I was able to for traceIdTimeStamps.  Because I can't access the values in order, I can't break out early when looping like for data to purge.  This causes the performance show in the next point:\r\n\r\n6. I've tested up to 1 million spans.  When adding spans, the response time is 2-3 ms until we hit the limit and need to start purging.  At this point, the response time becomes ~150 ms.  This is not unbearably slow but I think will improve once 5) gets fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-27T04:29:45Z","updated_at":"2017-07-04T02:24:17Z","closed_at":"2017-07-04T02:24:17Z","merged_at":"2017-07-04T02:24:17Z","merge_commit_sha":"c16172126f586137e7b7bb8db634d308b85c167e","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1631/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1631/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1631/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/statuses/51fc0c9c26c5a6a8659b88e07984207c11c03d10","head":{"label":"joel-airspring:boundMemory","ref":"boundMemory","sha":"51fc0c9c26c5a6a8659b88e07984207c11c03d10","user":{"login":"joel-airspring","id":4552139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTIxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4552139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-airspring","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":85808745,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4NTgwODc0NQ==","name":"zipkin","full_name":"joel-airspring/zipkin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"joel-airspring","id":4552139,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1NTIxMzk=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4552139?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring","html_url":"https://github.com/joel-airspring","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joel-airspring/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/joel-airspring/zipkin","description":"Zipkin

have a Zipkin deployment where there is one instance of zipkin-server providing the query API and a second instance running the (kafka in our case) collector. The zipkin-server instance providing the query API will be exposed to HTTP traffic from our internal network and it is preferable if the exposed HTTP API is read-only to prevent users from creating span data. Disabling the HTTP collector accomplishes this.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this change is similar to the rationale described on #1591, and the approach taken to implement this is very similar to the one from the PR for that issue (#1593).\r\n\r\nThese changes add a configuration point for enabling or disabling the HTTP collector in zipkin-server. This can be controlled through the property zipkin.collector.http.enabled or the corresponding environment variable HTTP_COLLECTOR_ENABLED. The collector is enabled by default.","created_at":"2017-06-13T22:07:20Z","updated_at":"2017-06-15T22:29:59Z","closed_at":"2017-06-15T07:07:35Z","merged_at":"2017-06-15T07:07:35Z","merge_commit_sha":"9792fc6a2f0ac503e086dbafe02a5376d6c782a6","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1615/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1615/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1615/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/statuses/4239565be2c0bb143c8fbba663321d6a7d7c1deb","head":{"label":"dgrabows:disable-http-collector","ref":"disable-http-collector","sha":"4239565be2c0bb143c8fbba663321d6a7d7c1deb","user":{"login":"dgrabows","id":201525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/201525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrabows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":89952885,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk4OTk1Mjg4NQ==","name":"zipkin","full_name":"dgrabows/zipkin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"dgrabows","id":201525,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIwMTUyNQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/201525?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows","html_url":"https://github.com/dgrabows","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dgrabows/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin","description":"Zipkin

change replaces our custom logic for exposing metrics with the implementation in the upstream Prometheus client, as noted in https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/pull/1144#issuecomment-288762140. The notable improvement (other than less code) is the addition of histogram data of response times, using a servlet filter (the data looks something like this: https://gist.github.com/abesto/46aeb18ab45e5126ccebc515eb3fc99f)\r\n\r\nMetrics comparison: [before](https://gist.github.com/abesto/25594dc217e70ad9b9bddd656eb663d4) / [after](https://gist.github.com/abesto/0e9afff23daacb0f4301c9b977012ad5)\r\n\r\nThere were two issues that blocked us from merging this for a while:\r\n\r\n * [x] We're hit by https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/issues/252 (pops up only when Prometheus tries to query the data, you can still check out `/prometheus` from a browser just fine)\r\n * [x] The upstream integration with Spring Boot Actuator metrics doesn't use the `counter.` and `gauge.` prefixes to figure out the right metric type, always defaults to `gauge`. https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/pull/254 aims to fix this.\r\n","created_at":"2017-06-10T11:48:32Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T08:31:41Z","closed_at":"2017-10-10T08:31:33Z","merged_at":"2017-10-10T08:31:33Z","merge_commit_sha":"ed2a05dfc11f88876106832ed977c08022a9a6c4","assignee":null,"assignees":[],"requested_reviewers":[],"requested_teams":[],"labels":[],"milestone":null,"draft":false,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1609/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/1609/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/pulls/comments{/number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1609/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/openzipkin/zipkin/statuses/0104dde21100711e5432e904480d4f89045f998a","head":{"label":"openzipkin:prometheus-use-upstream","ref":"prometheus-use-upstream","sha":"0104dde21100711e5432e904480d4f89045f998a","user":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":4576305,"node_id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk0NTc2MzA1","name":"zipkin","full_name":"openzipkin/zipkin","private":false,"owner":{"login":"openzipkin","id":11860887,"node_id":"MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjExODYwODg3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11860887?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin","html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/openzipkin/received_events","type":"Organization","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"html_url":"https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin","description":"Zipkin

We'll be back with a fix (and updated tests).\r\n```\r\n17/06/01 23:18:00 ERROR Executor: Exception in task 361.0 in stage 0.0 (TID 361)\r\njava.lang.NullPointerException\r\n\tat

changes add a new collector module supporting Kafka 0.10+ (zipkin-collector-kafka10) and the associated auto-configure module (zipkin-autoconfigure-collector-kafka10). They also make the auto-configure module a dependency of zipkin-server, with the collector activated by setting the `KAFKA_BOOSTRAP_SERVERS` environment variable. See https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/tree/kafka10-collector/zipkin-server#kafka-010-collector for more details on the supported configuration.\r\n\r\nFurther changes are needed to how the new collector is integrated with zipkin-server. As currently implemented, the 0.10.2.0 version of the org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients dependency takes precendence over the 0.8.x.x one when zipkin-server is built. This will prevent the existing 0.8 Kafka collector from working. From https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin/issues/1405#issuecomment-300023053:\r\n\r\n> wrt how we address integration, I think the best way is to act like sqs,\r\nwhere we package a module jar (and this includes a zipkin-server-kafka file\r\nlike\r\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-aws/blob/master/autoconfigure/collector-sqs/src/main/resources/zipkin-server-sqs.yml\r\n)\r\n>\r\n> The pom would include a module file as well, like this, except different\r\nexcludes:\r\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-aws/blob/master/autoconfigure/collector-sqs/pom.xml\r\n>\r\n> Running will be a little messier than this because of classpath\r\nhttps://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-aws/tree/master/autoconfigure/collector-sqs#running\r\n>\r\n> For example, we'll probably have to customize the docker image based on\r\npresence of the KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS variable, and move old jars out of\r\nthe way.. we may end up lucky enough to not need to do that. Basically,\r\nonce there's a module dir the next step is seeing how lucky we are.. in\r\nbest case classpath order works and we don't need to hack the all jar to\r\ntake out the kafka08 stuff.\r\n>\r\n> In the future, we could make a thin launcher\r\nhttps://github.com/dsyer/spring-boot-thin-launcher as the default image\r\n\r\nOutstanding tasks I'm aware of:\r\n- [x] Add unit test to https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/blob/kafka10-collector/zipkin-collector/kafka10/src/test/java/zipkin/collector/kafka10/KafkaCollectorTest.java#L204 for collector running multiple threads.\r\n- [x] Review/update closing of Kafka consumers when consumer thread is interrupted. See https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/blob/kafka10-collector/zipkin-collector/kafka10/src/main/java/zipkin/collector/kafka10/KafkaConsumerProcessor.java#L83\r\n- [x] Add zipkin-server-kafka.yml configuration file to https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/tree/kafka10-collector/zipkin-autoconfigure/collector-kafka10/src/main/resources\r\n- [x] Update https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/blob/kafka10-collector/zipkin-autoconfigure/collector-kafka10/pom.xml to produce a module jar\r\n- [x] Remove zipkin-autoconfigure-collector-kafka10 dependency from https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/blob/kafka10-collector/zipkin-server/pom.xml\r\n- [x] Move usage documentation from https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/blob/kafka10-collector/zipkin-server/README.md#kafka-010-collector to new README.md in https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/tree/kafka10-collector/zipkin-autoconfigure/collector-kafka10 and update to reflect approach of loading the kafka10 collector from an external module jar\r\n- [x] Uncomment https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/blob/kafka10-collector/zipkin-autoconfigure/collector-kafka10/src/test/java/zipkin/collector/kafka10/ZipkinKafkaCollectorAutoConfigurationTest.java#L88 and get test passing\r\n- [x] Clean up logging APIs, implementations, and configuration in https://github.com/dgrabows/zipkin/tree/kafka10-collector/zipkin-collector/kafka10\r\n\r\nThere are probably also changes to https://github.com/openzipkin/docker-zipkin that are not yet clear to me, although that's probably a separate pull request given that it's a different repository.\r\n\r\nAttempts to resolve

began receiving \"blank pages\" (with header) when enabled self-tracing and tried to search for them with following JS error:\r\n\r\nUncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'duration' of null (traceSummary.js)\r\n\r\nThen figured out that there are some traces with absent timestamp field in root spans (actually, there are cases with some contiguous spans with null timestamps, starting from root spans).\r\nAs far as I remember, there are some existing valid cases (aren't they?) when timestamps may be null.\r\nSo, there is a straightforward (maybe not very elegant) solution with removing useless null-timestamped traces. Actually, I'm not sure that it's the right way to solve the problem, but it allows to see at least valid traces and not blank

the http Elasticsearch module had a hard dependency on\r\nElasticsearch 2.x libraries. This was simply work left unfinished, as\r\nthe effort to completely decouple was high.\r\n\r\nThis change completes the separation of the http elasticsearch code\r\nfrom the prior codebase. You can now drop in `ElasticsearchHttpStorage`\r\nwhere you previously used `ElasticsearchStorage`. You can now use\r\nElasticsearch without a guava or native library dependency.\r\n\r\nServer dependencies and default configuration are left unaffected except\r\nthat there is no more sharing between the auto-configuration classes of\r\nthe native transport vs the http transport. This means that if you make\r\na custom server with `zipkin-autoconfigure-storage-elasticsearch-http`,\r\nyou won't transitively pull in Guava or Elasticsearch 2.x libraries.\r\n\r\nThe old `HttpClientBuilder` is now deprecated and as mentioned above, no\r\nlonger used. Until it is removed, there is an optional dependency on the\r\nnative code in `zipkin-storage-elasticsearch-http`. Beyond clutter, and\r\nincreasing test duration, there's little impact to this.\r\n\r\nFixes
